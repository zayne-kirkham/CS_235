the
little
prince
antoine
de

antoine
de
saintexupery
who
was
a
french
author
journalist
and
pilot
wrote
the
little
prince
in

one
year
before
his
death
the
little
prince
appears
to
be
a
simple
childrens
tale
some
would
say
that
it
is
actually
a
profound
and
deeply
moving
tale
written
in
riddles
and
laced
with
philosophy
and
poetic
metaphor
once
when
i
was
six
years
old
i
saw
a
magnificent
picture
in
a
book
called
true
stories
from
nature
about
the
primeval
forest
it
was
a
picture
of
a
boa
constrictor
in
the
act
of
swallowing
an
animal
here
is
a
copy
of
the
drawing
in
the
book
it
said
boa
constrictors
swallow
their
prey
whole
without
chewing
it
after
that
they
are
not
able
to
move
and
they
sleep
through
the
six
months
that
they
need
for
digestion
i
pondered
deeply
then
over
the
adventures
of
the
jungle
and
after
some
work
with
a
coloured
pencil
i
succeeded
in
making
my
first
drawing
my
drawing
number
one
it
looked
like
this
i
showed
my
masterpiece
to
the
grownups
and
asked
them
whether
the
drawing
frightened
them
but
they
answered
frighten
why
should
any
one
be
frightened
by
a
hat
my
drawing
was
not
a
picture
of
a
hat
it
was
a
picture
of
a
boa
constrictor
digesting
an
elephant
but
since
the
grown
ups
were
not
able
to
understand
it
i
made
another
drawing
i
drew
the
inside
of
the
boa
constrictor
so
that
the
grownups
could
see
it
clearly
they
always
need
to
have
things
explained
my
drawing
number
two
looked
like
this
the
grownups
response
this
time
was
to
advise
me
to
lay
aside
my
drawings
of
boa
constrictors
whether
from
the
inside
or
the
outside
and
devote
myself
instead
to
geography
history
arithmetic
and
grammar
that
is
why
at
the
age
of
six
i
gave
up
what
might
have
been
a
magnificent
career
as
a
painter
i
had
been
disheartened
by
the
failure
of
my
drawing
number
one
and
my
drawing
number
two
grownups
never
understand
anything
by
themselves
and
it
is
tiresome
for
children
to
be
always
and
forever
explaining
things
to
them
so
then
i
chose
another
profession
and
learned
to
pilot
airplanes
i
have
flown
a
little
over
all
parts
of
the
world
and
it
is
true
that
geography
has
been
very
useful
to
me
at
a
glance
i
can
distinguish
china
from
arizona
if
one
gets
lost
in
the
night
such
knowledge
is
valuable
in
the
course
of
this
life
i
have
had
a
great
many
encounters
with
a
great
many
people
who
have
been
concerned
with
matters
of
consequence
i
have
lived
a
great
deal
among
grownups
i
have
seen
them
intimately
close
at
hand
and
that
hasnt
much
improved
my
opinion
of
them
whenever
i
met
one
of
them
who
seemed
to
me
at
all
clearsighted
i
tried
the
experiment
of
showing
him
my
drawing
number
one
which
i
have
always
kept
i
would
try
to
find
out
so
if
this
was
a
person
of
true
understanding
but
whoever
it
was
he
or
she
would
always
say
that
is
a
hat
then
i
would
never
talk
to
that
person
about
boa
constrictors
or
primeval
forests
or
stars
i
would
bring
myself
down
to
his
level
i
would
talk
to
him
about
bridge
and
golf
and
politics
and
neckties
and
the
grownup
would
be
greatly
pleased
to
have
met
such
a
sensible
man
so
i
lived
my
life
alone
without
anyone
that
i
could
really
talk
to
until
i
had
an
accident
with
my
plane
in
the
desert
of
sahara
six
years
ago
something
was
broken
in
my
engine
and
as
i
had
with
me
neither
a
mechanic
nor
any
passengers
i
set
myself
to
attempt
the
difficult
repairs
all
alone
it
was
a
question
of
life
or
death
for
me
i
had
scarcely
enough
drinking
water
to
last
a
week
the
first
night
then
i
went
to
sleep
on
the
sand
a
thousand
miles
from
any
human
habitation
i
was
more
isolated
than
a
shipwrecked
sailor
on
a
raft
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
thus
you
can
imagine
my
amazement
at
sunrise
when
i
was
awakened
by
an
odd
little
voice
it
said
if
you
please
draw
me
a
sheep
what
draw
me
a
sheep
i
jumped
to
my
feet
completely
thunderstruck
i
blinked
my
eyes
hard
i
looked
carefully
all
around
me
and
i
saw
a
most
extraordinary
small
person
who
stood
there
examining
me
with
great
seriousness
here
you
may
see
the
best
portrait
that
later
i
was
able
to
make
of
him
but
my
drawing
is
certainly
very
much
less
charming
than
its
model
that
however
is
not
my
fault
the
grownups
discouraged
me
in
my
painters
career
when
i
was
six
years
old
and
i
never
learned
to
draw
anything
except
boas
from
the
outside
and
boas
from
the
inside
now
i
stared
at
this
sudden
apparition
with
my
eyes
fairly
starting
out
of
my
head
in
astonishment
remember
i
had
crashed
in
the
desert
a
thousand
miles
from
any
inhabited
region
and
yet
my
little
man
seemed
neither
to
be
straying
uncertainly
among
the
sands
nor
to
be
fainting
from
fatigue
or
hunger
or
thirst
or
fear
nothing
about
him
gave
any
suggestion
of
a
child
lost
in
the
middle
of
the
desert
a
thousand
miles
from
any
human
habitation
when
at
last
i
was
able
to
speak
i
said
to
him
but
what
are
you
doing
here
and
in
answer
he
repeated
very
slowly
as
if
he
were
speaking
of
a
matter
of
great
consequence
if
you
please
draw
me
a
sheep
when
a
mystery
is
too
overpowering
one
dare
not
disobey
absurd
as
it
might
seem
to
me
a
thousand
miles
from
any
human
habitation
and
in
danger
of
death
i
took
out
of
my
pocket
a
sheet
of
paper
and
my
fountain
pen
but
then
i
remembered
how
my
studies
had
been
concentrated
on
geography
history
arithmetic
and
grammar
and
i
told
the
little
chap
a
little
crossly
too
that
i
did
not
know
how
to
draw
he
answered
me
that
doesnt
matter
draw
me
a
sheep
but
i
had
never
drawn
a
sheep
so
i
drew
for
him
one
of
the
two
pictures
i
had
drawn
so
often
it
was
that
of
the
boa
constrictor
from
the
outside
and
i
was
astounded
to
hear
the
little
fellow
greet
it
with
no
no
no
i
do
not
want
an
elephant
inside
a
boa
constrictor
a
boa
constrictor
is
a
very
dangerous
creature
and
an
elephant
is
very
cumbersome
where
i
live
everything
is
very
small
what
i
need
is
a
sheep
draw
me
a
sheep
so
then
i
made
a
drawing
he
looked
at
it
carefully
then
he
said
no
this
sheep
is
already
very
sickly
make
me
another
so
i
made
another
drawing
my
friend
smiled
gently
and
indulgently
you
see
yourself
he
said
that
this
is
not
a
sheep
this
is
a
ram
it
has
horns
so
then
i
did
my
drawing
over
once
more
but
it
was
rejected
too
just
like
the
others
this
one
is
too
old
i
want
a
sheep
that
will
live
a
long
time
by
this
time
my
patience
was
exhausted
because
i
was
in
a
hurry
to
start
taking
my
engine
apart
so
i
tossed
off
this
drawing
and
i
threw
out
an
explanation
with
it
this
is
only
his
box
the
sheep
you
asked
for
is
inside
i
was
very
surprised
to
see
a
light
break
over
the
face
of
my
young
judge
that
is
exactly
the
way
i
wanted
it
do
you
think
that
this
sheep
will
have
to
have
a
great
deal
of
grass
why
because
where
i
live
everything
is
very
small
there
will
surely
be
enough
grass
for
him
i
said
it
is
a
very
small
sheep
that
i
have
given
you
he
bent
his
head
over
the
drawing
not
so
small
that
look
he
has
gone
to
sleep
and
that
is
how
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
little
prince
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
learn
where
he
came
from
the
little
prince
who
asked
me
so
many
questions
never
seemed
to
hear
the
ones
i
asked
him
it
was
from
words
dropped
by
chance
that
little
by
little
everything
was
revealed
to
me
the
first
time
he
saw
my
airplane
for
instance
i
shall
not
draw
my
airplane
that
would
be
much
too
complicated
for
me
he
asked
me
what
is
that
object
that
is
not
an
object
it
flies
it
is
an
airplane
it
is
my
airplane
and
i
was
proud
to
have
him
learn
that
i
could
fly
he
cried
out
then
what
you
dropped
down
from
the
sky
yes
i
answered
modestly
oh
that
is
funny
and
the
little
prince
broke
into
a
lovely
peal
of
laughter
which
irritated
me
very
much
i
like
my
misfortunes
to
be
taken
seriously
then
he
added
so
you
too
come
from
the
sky
which
is
your
planet
at
that
moment
i
caught
a
gleam
of
light
in
the
impenetrable
mystery
of
his
presence
and
i
demanded
abruptly
do
you
come
from
another
planet
but
he
did
not
reply
he
tossed
his
head
gently
without
taking
his
eyes
from
my
plane
it
is
true
that
on
that
you
cant
have
come
from
very
far
away
and
he
sank
into
a
reverie
which
lasted
a
long
time
then
taking
my
sheep
out
of
his
pocket
he
buried
himself
in
the
contemplation
of
his
treasure
you
can
imagine
how
my
curiosity
was
aroused
by
this
halfconfidence
about
the
other
planets
i
made
a
great
effort
therefore
to
find
out
more
on
this
subject
my
little
man
where
do
you
come
from
what
is
this
where
i
live
of
which
you
speak
where
do
you
want
to
take
your
sheep
after
a
reflective
silence
he
answered
the
thing
that
is
so
good
about
the
box
you
have
given
me
is
that
at
night
he
can
use
it
as
his
house
that
is
so
and
if
you
are
good
i
will
give
you
a
string
too
so
that
you
can
tie
him
during
the
day
and
a
post
to
tie
him
to
but
the
little
prince
seemed
shocked
by
this
offer
tie
him
what
a
queer
idea
but
if
you
dont
tie
him
i
said
he
will
wander
off
somewhere
and
get
lost
my
friend
broke
into
another
peal
of
laughter
but
where
do
you
think
he
would
go
anywhere
straight
ahead
of
him
then
the
little
prince
said
earnestly
that
doesnt
matter
where
i
live
everything
is
so
small
and
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
sadness
he
added
straight
ahead
of
him
nobody
can
go
very
far
i
had
thus
learned
a
second
fact
of
great
importance
this
was
that
the
planet
the
little
prince
came
from
was
scarcely
any
larger
than
a
house
but
that
did
not
really
surprise
me
much
i
knew
very
well
that
in
addition
to
the
great
planets
such
as
the
earth
jupiter
mars
venus
to
which
we
have
given
names
there
are
also
hundreds
of
others
some
of
which
are
so
small
that
one
has
a
hard
time
seeing
them
through
the
telescope
when
an
astronomer
discovers
one
of
these
he
does
not
give
it
a
name
but
only
a
number
he
might
call
it
for
example
asteroid

i
have
serious
reason
to
believe
that
the
planet
from
which
the
little
prince
came
is
the
asteroid
known
as
b
this
asteroid
has
only
once
been
seen
through
the
telescope
that
was
by
a
turkish
astronomer
in

on
making
his
discovery
the
astronomer
had
presented
it
to
the
international
astronomical
congress
in
a
great
demonstration
but
he
was
in
turkish
costume
and
so
nobody
would
believe
what
he
said
grownups
are
like
that
fortunately
however
for
the
reputation
of
asteroid
b
a
turkish
dictator
made
a
law
that
his
subjects
under
pain
of
death
should
change
to
european
costume
so
in

the
astronomer
gave
his
demonstration
all
over
again
dressed
with
impressive
style
and
elegance
and
this
time
everybody
accepted
his
report
if
i
have
told
you
these
details
about
the
asteroid
and
made
a
note
of
its
number
for
you
it
is
on
account
of
the
grownups
and
their
ways
when
you
tell
them
that
you
have
made
a
new
friend
they
never
ask
you
any
questions
about
essential
matters
they
never
say
to
you
what
does
his
voice
sound
like
what
games
does
he
love
best
does
he
collect
butterflies
instead
they
demand
how
old
is
he
how
many
brothers
has
he
how
much
does
he
weigh
how
much
money
does
his
father
make
only
from
these
figures
do
they
think
they
have
learned
anything
about
him
if
you
were
to
say
to
the
grownups
i
saw
a
beautiful
house
made
of
rosy
brick
with
geraniums
in
the
windows
and
doves
on
the
roof
they
would
not
be
able
to
get
any
idea
of
that
house
at
all
you
would
have
to
say
to
them
i
saw
a
house
that
cost


then
they
would
exclaim
oh
what
a
pretty
house
that
is
just
so
you
might
say
to
them
the
proof
that
the
little
prince
existed
is
that
he
was
charming
that
he
laughed
and
that
he
was
looking
for
a
sheep
if
anybody
wants
a
sheep
that
is
a
proof
that
he
exists
and
what
good
would
it
do
to
tell
them
that
they
would
shrug
their
shoulders
and
treat
you
like
a
child
but
if
you
said
to
them
the
planet
he
came
from
is
asteroid
b
then
they
would
be
convinced
and
leave
you
in
peace
from
their
questions
they
are
like
that
one
must
not
hold
it
against
them
children
should
always
show
great
forbearance
toward
grownup
people
but
certainly
for
us
who
understand
life
figures
are
a
matter
of
indifference
i
should
have
liked
to
begin
this
story
in
the
fashion
of
the
fairytales
i
should
have
like
to
say
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
little
prince
who
lived
on
a
planet
that
was
scarcely
any
bigger
than
himself
and
who
had
need
of
a
sheep
to
those
who
understand
life
that
would
have
given
a
much
greater
air
of
truth
to
my
story
fori
do
not
want
any
one
to
read
my
book
carelessly
i
have
suffered
too
much
grief
in
setting
down
these
memories
six
years
have
already
passed
since
my
friend
went
away
from
me
with
his
sheep
if
i
try
to
describe
him
here
it
is
to
make
sure
that
i
shall
not
forget
him
to
forget
a
friend
is
sad
not
every
one
has
had
a
friend
and
if
i
forget
him
i
may
become
like
the
grownups
who
are
no
longer
interested
in
anything
but
figures
it
is
for
that
purpose
again
that
i
have
bought
a
box
of
paints
and
some
pencils
it
is
hard
to
take
up
drawing
again
at
my
age
when
i
have
never
made
any
pictures
except
those
of
the
boa
constrictor
from
the
outside
and
the
boa
constrictor
from
the
inside
since
i
was
six
i
shall
certainly
try
to
make
my
portraits
as
true
to
life
as
possible
but
i
am
not
at
all
sure
of
success
one
drawing
goes
along
all
right
and
another
has
no
resemblance
to
its
subject
i
make
some
errors
too
in
the
little
princes
height
in
one
place
he
is
too
tall
and
in
another
too
short
and
i
feel
some
doubts
about
the
colour
of
his
costume
so
i
fumble
along
as
best
i
can
now
good
now
bad
and
i
hope
generally
fairto
middling
in
certain
more
important
details
i
shall
make
mistakes
also
but
that
is
something
that
will
not
be
my
fault
my
friend
never
explained
anything
to
me
he
thought
perhaps
that
i
was
like
himself
but
i
alas
do
not
know
how
to
see
sheep
through
the
walls
of
boxes
perhaps
i
am
a
little
like
the
grownups
i
have
had
to
grow
old
as
each
day
passed
i
would
learn
in
our
talk
something
about
the
little
princes
planet
his
departure
from
it
his
journey
the
information
would
come
very
slowly
as
it
might
chance
to
fall
from
his
thoughts
it
was
in
this
way
that
i
heard
on
the
third
day
about
the
catastrophe
of
the
baobabs
this
time
once
more
i
had
the
sheep
to
thank
for
it
for
the
little
prince
asked
me
abruptly
as
if
seized
by
a
grave
doubt
it
is
true
isnt
it
that
sheep
eat
little
bushes
yes
that
is
true
ah
i
am
glad
i
did
not
understand
why
it
was
so
important
that
sheep
should
eat
little
bushes
but
the
little
prince
added
then
it
follows
that
they
also
eat
baobabs
i
pointed
out
to
the
little
prince
that
baobabs
were
not
little
bushes
but
on
the
contrary
trees
as
big
as
castles
and
that
even
if
he
took
a
whole
herd
of
elephants
away
with
him
the
herd
would
not
eat
up
one
single
baobab
the
idea
of
the
herd
of
elephants
made
the
little
prince
laugh
we
would
have
to
put
them
one
on
top
of
the
other
he
said
but
he
made
a
wise
comment
before
they
grow
so
big
the
baobabs
start
out
by
being
little
that
is
strictly
correct
i
said
but
why
do
you
want
the
sheep
to
eat
the
little
baobabs
he
answered
me
at
once
oh
come
come
as
if
he
were
speaking
of
something
that
was
self
evident
and
i
was
obliged
to
make
a
great
mental
effort
to
solve
this
problem
without
any
assistance
indeed
as
i
learned
there
were
on
the
planet
where
the
little
prince
lived
as
on
all
planets
good
plants
and
bad
plants
in
consequence
there
were
good
seeds
from
good
plants
and
bad
seeds
from
bad
plants
but
seeds
are
invisible
they
sleep
deep
in
the
heart
of
the
earths
darkness
until
some
one
among
them
is
seized
with
the
desire
to
awaken
then
this
little
seed
will
stretch
itself
and
begin
timidly
at
first
to
push
a
charming
little
sprig
inoffensively
upward
toward
the
sun
if
it
is
only
a
sprout
of
radish
or
the
sprig
of
a
rosebush
one
would
let
it
grow
wherever
it
might
wish
but
when
it
is
a
bad
plant
one
must
destroy
it
as
soon
as
possible
the
very
first
instant
that
one
recognises
it
now
there
were
some
terrible
seeds
on
the
planet
that
was
the
home
of
the
little
prince
and
these
were
the
seeds
of
the
baobab
the
soil
of
that
planet
was
infested
with
them
a
baobab
is
something
you
will
never
never
be
able
to
get
rid
of
if
you
attend
to
it
too
late
it
spreads
over
the
entire
planet
it
bores
clear
through
it
with
its
roots
and
if
the
planet
is
too
small
and
the
baobabs
are
too
many
they
split
it
in
pieces
it
is
a
question
of
discipline
the
little
prince
said
to
me
later
on
when
youve
finished
your
own
toilet
in
the
morning
then
it
is
time
to
attend
to
the
toilet
of
your
planet
just
so
with
the
greatest
care
you
must
see
to
it
that
you
pull
up
regularly
all
the
baobabs
at
the
very
first
moment
when
they
can
be
distinguished
from
the
rosebushes
which
they
resemble
so
closely
in
their
earliest
youth
it
is
very
tedious
work
the
little
prince
added
but
very
easy
and
one
day
he
said
to
me
you
ought
to
make
a
beautiful
drawing
so
that
the
children
where
you
live
can
see
exactly
how
all
this
is
that
would
be
very
useful
to
them
if
they
were
to
travel
some
day
sometimes
he
added
there
is
no
harm
in
putting
off
a
piece
of
work
until
another
day
but
when
it
is
a
matter
of
baobabs
that
always
means
a
catastrophe
i
knew
a
planet
that
was
inhabited
by
a
lazy
man
he
neglected
three
little
bushes
so
as
the
little
prince
described
it
to
me
i
have
made
a
drawing
of
that
planet
i
do
not
much
like
to
take
the
tone
of
a
moralist
but
the
danger
of
the
baobabs
is
so
little
understood
and
such
considerable
risks
would
be
run
by
anyone
who
might
get
lost
on
an
asteroid
that
for
once
i
am
breaking
through
my
reserve
children
i
say
plainly
watch
out
for
the
baobabs
my
friends
like
myself
have
been
skirting
this
danger
for
a
long
time
without
ever
knowing
it
and
so
it
is
for
them
that
i
have
worked
so
hard
over
this
drawing
the
lesson
which
i
pass
on
by
this
means
is
worth
all
the
trouble
it
has
cost
me
perhaps
you
will
ask
me
why
are
there
no
other
drawing
in
this
book
as
magnificent
and
impressive
as
this
drawing
of
the
baobabs
the
reply
is
simple
i
have
tried
but
with
the
others
i
have
not
been
successful
when
i
made
the
drawing
of
the
baobabs
i
was
carried
beyond
myself
by
the
inspiring
force
of
urgent
necessity
oh
little
prince
bit
by
bit
i
came
to
understand
the
secrets
of
your
sad
little
life
for
a
long
time
you
had
found
your
only
entertainment
in
the
quiet
pleasure
of
looking
at
the
sunset
i
learned
that
new
detail
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
when
you
said
to
me
i
am
very
fond
of
sunsets
come
let
us
go
look
at
a
sunset
now
but
we
must
wait
i
said
wait
for
what
for
the
sunset
we
must
wait
until
it
is
time
at
first
you
seemed
to
be
very
much
surprised
and
then
you
laughed
to
yourself
you
said
to
me
i
am
always
thinking
that
i
am
at
home
just
so
everybody
knows
that
when
it
is
noon
in
the
united
states
the
sun
is
setting
over
france
if
you
could
fly
to
france
in
one
minute
you
could
go
straight
into
the
sunset
right
from
noon
unfortunately
france
is
too
far
away
for
that
but
on
your
tiny
planet
my
little
prince
all
you
need
do
is
move
your
chair
a
few
steps
you
can
see
the
day
end
and
the
twilight
falling
whenever
you
like
one
day
you
said
to
me
i
saw
the
sunset
fortyfour
times
and
a
little
later
you
added
you
know
one
loves
the
sunset
when
one
is
so
sad
were
you
so
sad
then
i
asked
on
the
day
of
the
fortyfour
sunsets
but
the
little
prince
made
no
reply
on
the
fifth
day
again
as
always
it
was
thanks
to
the
sheep
the
secret
of
the
little
princes
life
was
revealed
to
me
abruptly
without
anything
to
lead
up
to
it
and
as
if
the
question
had
been
born
of
long
and
silent
meditation
on
his
problem
he
demanded
a
sheep
if
it
eats
little
bushes
does
it
eat
flowers
too
a
sheep
i
answered
eats
anything
it
finds
in
its
reach
even
flowers
that
have
thorns
yes
even
flowers
that
have
thorns
then
the
thorns
what
use
are
they
i
did
not
know
at
that
moment
i
was
very
busy
trying
to
unscrew
a
bolt
that
had
got
stuck
in
my
engine
i
was
very
much
worried
for
it
was
becoming
clear
to
me
that
the
breakdown
of
my
plane
was
extremely
serious
and
i
had
so
little
drinking
water
left
that
i
had
to
fear
for
the
worst
the
thorns
what
use
are
they
the
little
prince
never
let
go
of
a
question
once
he
had
asked
it
as
for
me
i
was
upset
over
that
bolt
and
i
answered
with
the
first
thing
that
came
into
my
head
the
thorns
are
of
no
use
at
all
flowers
have
thorns
just
for
spite
oh
there
was
a
moment
of
complete
silence
then
the
little
prince
flashed
back
at
me
with
a
kind
of
resentfulness
i
dont
believe
you
flowers
are
weak
creatures
they
are
naive
they
reassure
themselves
as
best
they
can
they
believe
that
their
thorns
are
terrible
weapons
i
did
not
answer
at
that
instant
i
was
saying
to
myself
if
this
bolt
still
wont
turn
i
am
going
to
knock
it
out
with
the
hammer
again
the
little
prince
disturbed
my
thoughts
and
you
actually
believe
that
the
flowers
oh
no
i
cried
no
no
no
i
dont
believe
anything
i
answered
you
with
the
first
thing
that
came
into
my
head
dont
you
see
i
am
very
busy
with
matters
of
consequence
he
stared
at
me
thunderstruck
matters
of
consequence
he
looked
at
me
there
with
my
hammer
in
my
hand
my
fingers
black
with
engine
grease
bending
down
over
an
object
which
seemed
to
him
extremely
ugly
you
talk
just
like
the
grownups
that
made
me
a
little
ashamed
but
he
went
on
relentlessly
you
mix
everything
up
together
you
confuse
everything
he
was
really
very
angry
he
tossed
his
golden
curls
in
the
breeze
i
know
a
planet
where
there
is
a
certain
redfaced
gentleman
he
has
never
smelled
a
flower
he
has
never
looked
at
a
star
he
has
never
loved
any
one
he
has
never
done
anything
in
his
life
but
add
up
figures
and
all
day
he
says
over
and
over
just
like
you
i
am
busy
with
matters
of
consequence
and
that
makes
him
swell
up
with
pride
but
he
is
not
a
man
he
is
a
mushroom
a
what
a
mushroom
the
little
prince
was
now
white
with
rage
the
flowers
have
been
growing
thorns
for
millions
of
years
for
millions
of
years
the
sheep
have
been
eating
them
just
the
same
and
is
it
not
a
matter
of
consequence
to
try
to
understand
why
the
flowers
go
to
so
much
trouble
to
grow


i

thorns
which
are
never
of
any
use
to
them
is
the
warfare
between
the
sheep
and
the
flowers
not
important
is
this
not
of
more
consequence
than
a
fat
redfaced
gentlemans
sums
and
if
i
know
i
myself
one
flower
which
is
unique
in
the
world
which
grows
nowhere
but
on
my
planet
but
which
one
little
sheep
can
destroy
in
a
single
bite
some
morning
without
even
noticing
what
he
is
doing
oh
you
think
that
is
not
important
his
face
turned
from
white
to
red
as
he
continued
if
some
one
loves
a
flower
of
which
just
one
single
blossom
grows
in
all
the
millions
and
millions
of
stars
it
is
enough
to
make
him
happy
just
to
look
at
the
stars
he
can
say
to
himself
somewhere
my
flower
is
there
but
if
the
sheep
eats
the
flower
in
one
moment
all
his
stars
will
be
darkened
and
you
think
that
is
not
important
he
could
not
say
anything
more
his
words
were
choked
by
sobbing
the
night
had
fallen
i
had
let
my
tools
drop
from
my
hands
of
what
moment
now
was
my
hammer
my
bolt
or
thirst
or
death
on
one
star
one
planet
my
planet
the
earth
there
was
a
little
prince
to
be
comforted
i
took
him
in
my
arms
and
rocked
him
i
said
to
him
the
flower
that
you
love
is
not
in
danger
i
will
draw
you
a
muzzle
for
your
sheep
i
will
draw
you
a
railing
to
put
around
your
flower
i
will
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
him
i
felt
awkward
and
blundering
i
did
not
know
how
i
could
reach
him
where
i
could
overtake
him
and
go
on
hand
in
hand
with
him
once
more
it
is
such
a
secret
place
the
land
of
tears
i
soon
learned
to
know
this
flower
better
on
the
little
princes
planet
the
flowers
had
always
been
very
simple
they
had
only
one
ring
of
petals
they
took
up
no
room
at
all
they
were
a
trouble
to
nobody
one
morning
they
would
appear
in
the
grass
and
by
night
they
would
have
faded
peacefully
away
but
one
day
from
a
seed
blown
from
no
one
knew
where
a
new
flower
had
come
up
and
the
little
prince
had
watched
very
closely
over
this
small
sprout
which
was
not
like
any
other
small
sprouts
on
his
planet
it
might
you
see
have
been
a
new
kind
of
baobab
the
shrub
soon
stopped
growing
and
began
to
get
ready
to
produce
a
flower
the
little
prince
who
was
present
at
the
first
appearance
of
a
huge
bud
felt
at
once
that
some
sort
of
miraculous
apparition
must
emerge
from
it
but
the
flower
was
not
satisfied
to
complete
the
preparations
for
her
beauty
in
the
shelter
of
her
green
chamber
she
chose
her
colours
with
the
greatest
care
she
adjusted
her
petals
one
by
one
she
did
not
wish
to
go
out
into
the
world
all
rumpled
like
the
field
poppies
it
was
only
in
the
full
radiance
of
her
beauty
that
she
wished
to
appear
oh
yes
she
was
a
coquettish
creature
and
her
mysterious
adornment
lasted
for
days
and
days
then
one
morning
exactly
at
sunrise
she
suddenly
showed
herself
and
after
working
with
all
this
painstaking
precision
she
yawned
and
said
ah
i
am
scarcely
awake
i
beg
that
you
will
excuse
me
my
petals
are
still
all
disarranged
but
the
little
prince
could
not
restrain
his
admiration
oh
how
beautiful
you
are
am
i
not
the
flower
responded
sweetly
and
i
was
born
at
the
same
moment
as
the
sun
the
little
prince
could
guess
easily
enough
that
she
was
not
any
too
modest
but
how
moving
and
exciting
she
was
i
think
it
is
time
for
breakfast
she
added
an
instant
later
if
you
would
have
the
kindness
to
think
of
my
needs
and
the
little
prince
completely
abashed
went
to
look
for
a
sprinkling
can
of
fresh
water
so
he
tended
the
flower
so
too
she
began
very
quickly
to
torment
him
with
her
vanity
which
was
if
the
truth
be
known
a
little
difficult
to
deal
with
one
day
for
instance
when
she
was
speaking
of
her
four
thorns
she
said
to
the
little
prince
let
the
tigers
come
with
their
claws
there
are
no
tigers
on
my
planet
the
little
prince
objected
and
anyway
tigers
do
not
eat
weeds
i
am
not
a
weed
the
flower
replied
sweetly
please
excuse
me
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
of
tigers
she
went
on
but
i
have
a
horror
of
drafts
i
suppose
you
wouldnt
screen
for
me
a
horror
of
drafts
that
is
bad
luck
for
a
plant
remarked
the
little
prince
and
added
to
himself
this
flower
is
a
very
complex
creature
at
night
i
want
you
to
put
me
under
a
glass
globe
it
is
very
cold
where
you
live
in
the
place
i
came
from
but
she
interrupted
herself
at
that
point
she
had
come
in
the
form
of
a
seed
she
could
not
have
known
anything
of
any
other
worlds
embarrassed
over
having
let
herself
be
caught
on
the
verge
of
such
an
untruth
she
coughed
two
or
three
times
in
order
to
put
the
little
prince
in
the
wrong
the
screen
i
was
just
going
to
look
for
it
when
you
spoke
to
me
then
she
forced
her
cough
a
little
more
so
that
he
should
suffer
from
remorse
just
the
same
so
the
little
prince
in
spite
of
all
the
good
will
that
was
inseparable
from
his
love
had
soon
come
to
doubt
her
he
had
taken
seriously
words
which
were
without
importance
and
it
made
him
very
unhappy
i
ought
not
to
have
listened
to
her
he
confided
to
me
one
day
one
never
ought
to
listen
to
the
flowers
one
should
simply
look
at
them
and
breathe
their
fragrance
mine
perfumed
all
my
planet
but
i
did
not
know
how
to
take
pleasure
in
all
her
grace
this
tale
of
claws
which
disturbed
me
so
much
should
only
have
filled
my
heart
with
tenderness
and
pity
and
he
continued
his
confidences
the
fact
is
that
i
did
not
know
how
to
understand
anything
i
ought
to
have
judged
by
deeds
and
not
by
words
she
cast
her
fragrance
and
her
radiance
over
me
i
ought
never
to
have
run
away
from
her
i
ought
to
have
guessed
all
the
affection
that
lay
behind
her
poor
little
stratagems
flowers
are
so
inconsistent
but
i
was
too
young
to
know
how
to
love
her
i
believe
that
for
his
escape
he
took
advantage
of
the
migration
of
a
flock
of
wild
birds
on
the
morning
of
his
departure
he
put
his
planet
in
perfect
order
he
carefully
cleaned
out
his
active
volcanoes
he
possessed
two
active
volcanoes
and
they
were
very
convenient
for
heating
his
breakfast
in
the
morning
he
also
had
one
volcano
that
was
extinct
but
as
he
said
one
never
knows
so
he
cleaned
out
the
extinct
volcano
too
if
they
are
well
cleaned
out
volcanoes
burn
slowly
and
steadily
without
any
eruptions
volcanic
eruptions
are
like
fires
in
a
chimney
on
our
earth
we
are
obviously
much
too
small
to
clean
out
our
volcanoes
that
is
why
they
bring
no
end
of
trouble
upon
us
the
little
prince
also
pulled
up
with
a
certain
sense
of
dejection
the
last
little
shoots
of
the
baobabs
he
believed
that
he
would
never
want
to
return
but
on
this
last
morning
all
these
familiar
tasks
seemed
very
precious
to
him
and
when
he
watered
the
flower
for
the
last
time
and
prepared
to
place
her
under
the
shelter
of
her
glass
globe
he
realised
that
he
was
very
close
to
tears
goodbye
he
said
to
the
flower
but
she
made
no
answer
goodbye
he
said
again
the
flower
coughed
but
it
was
not
because
she
had
a
cold
i
have
been
silly
she
said
to
him
at
last
i
ask
your
forgiveness
try
to
be
happy
he
was
surprised
by
this
absence
of
reproaches
he
stood
there
all
bewildered
the
glass
globe
held
arrested
in
midair
he
did
not
understand
this
quiet
sweetness
of
course
i
love
you
the
flower
said
to
him
it
is
my
fault
that
you
have
not
known
it
all
the
while
that
is
of
no
importance
but
you
you
have
been
just
as
foolish
as
i
try
to
be
happy
let
the
glass
globe
be
i
dont
want
it
any
more
but
the
wind
my
cold
is
not
so
bad
as
all
that
the
cool
night
air
will
do
me
good
i
am
a
flower
but
the
animals
well
i
must
endure
the
presence
of
two
or
three
caterpillars
if
i
wish
to
become
acquainted
with
the
butterflies
it
seems
that
they
are
very
beautiful
and
if
not
the
butterflies
and
the
caterpillars
who
will
call
upon
me
you
will
be
far
away
as
for
the
large
animals
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
of
any
of
them
i
have
my
claws
and
naively
she
showed
her
four
thorns
then
she
added
dont
linger
like
this
you
have
decided
to
go
away
now
go
for
she
did
not
want
him
to
see
her
crying
she
was
such
a
proud
flower
he
found
himself
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
asteroids





and

he
began
therefore
by
visiting
them
in
order
to
add
to
his
knowledge
the
first
of
them
was
inhabited
by
a
king
clad
in
royal
purple
and
ermine
he
was
seated
upon
a
throne
which
was
at
the
same
time
both
simple
and
majestic
ah
here
is
a
subject
exclaimed
the
king
when
he
saw
the
little
prince
coming
and
the
little
prince
asked
himself
how
could
he
recognise
me
when
he
had
never
seen
me
before
he
did
not
know
how
the
world
is
simplified
for
kings
to
them
all
men
are
subjects
approach
so
that
i
may
see
you
better
said
the
king
who
felt
consumingly
proud
of
being
at
last
a
king
over
somebody
the
little
prince
looked
everywhere
to
find
a
place
to
sit
down
but
the
entire
planet
was
crammed
and
obstructed
by
the
kings
magnificent
ermine
robe
so
he
remained
standing
upright
and
since
he
was
tired
he
yawned
it
is
contrary
to
etiquette
to
yawn
in
the
presence
of
a
king
the
monarch
said
to
him
i
forbid
you
to
do
so
i
cant
help
it
i
cant
stop
myself
replied
the
little
prince
thoroughly
embarrassed
i
have
come
on
a
long
journey
and
i
have
had
no
sleep
ah
then
the
king
said
i
order
you
to
yawn
it
is
years
since
i
have
seen
anyone
yawning
yawns
to
me
are
objects
of
curiosity
come
now
yawn
again
it
is
an
order
that
frightens
me
i
cannot
any
more
murmured
the
little
prince
now
completely
abashed
hum
hum
replied
the
king
then
i
i
order
you
sometimes
to
yawn
and
sometimes
to
he
sputtered
a
little
and
seemed
vexed
for
what
the
king
fundamentally
insisted
upon
was
that
his
authority
should
be
respected
he
tolerated
no
disobedience
he
was
an
absolute
monarch
but
because
he
was
a
very
good
man
he
made
his
orders
reasonable
if
i
ordered
a
general
he
would
say
by
way
of
example
if
i
ordered
a
general
to
change
himself
into
a
sea
bird
and
if
the
general
did
not
obey
me
that
would
not
be
the
fault
of
the
general
it
would
be
my
fault
may
i
sit
down
came
now
a
timid
inquiry
from
the
little
prince
i
order
you
to
do
so
the
king
answered
him
and
majestically
gathered
in
a
fold
of
his
ermine
mantle
but
the
little
prince
was
wondering
the
planet
was
tiny
over
what
could
this
king
really
rule
sire
he
said
to
him
i
beg
that
you
will
excuse
my
asking
you
a
question
i
order
you
to
ask
me
a
question
the
king
hastened
to
assure
him
sire
over
what
do
you
rule
over
everything
said
the
king
with
magnificent
simplicity
over
everything
the
king
made
a
gesture
which
took
in
his
planet
the
other
planets
and
all
the
stars
over
all
that
asked
the
little
prince
over
all
that
the
king
answered
for
his
rule
was
not
only
absolute
it
was
also
universal
and
the
stars
obey
you
certainly
they
do
the
king
said
they
obey
instantly
i
do
not
permit
insubordination
such
power
was
a
thing
for
the
little
prince
to
marvel
at
if
he
had
been
master
of
such
complete
authority
he
would
have
been
able
to
watch
the
sunset
not
fortyfour
times
in
one
day
but
seventytwo
or
even
a
hundred
or
even
two
hundred
times
with
out
ever
having
to
move
his
chair
and
because
he
felt
a
bit
sad
as
he
remembered
his
little
planet
which
he
had
forsaken
he
plucked
up
his
courage
to
ask
the
king
a
favour
i
should
like
to
see
a
sunset
do
me
that
kindness
order
the
sun
to
set
if
i
ordered
a
general
to
fly
from
one
flower
to
another
like
a
butterfly
or
to
write
a
tragic
drama
or
to
change
himself
into
a
sea
bird
and
if
the
general
did
not
carry
out
the
order
that
he
had
received
which
one
of
us
would
be
in
the
wrong
the
king
demanded
the
general
or
myself
you
said
the
little
prince
firmly
exactly
one
much
require
from
each
one
the
duty
which
each
one
can
perform
the
king
went
on
accepted
authority
rests
first
of
all
on
reason
if
you
ordered
your
people
to
go
and
throw
themselves
into
the
sea
they
would
rise
up
in
revolution
i
have
the
right
to
require
obedience
because
my
orders
are
reasonable
then
my
sunset
the
little
prince
reminded
him
for
he
never
forgot
a
question
once
he
had
asked
it
you
shall
have
your
sunset
i
shall
command
it
but
according
to
my
science
of
government
i
shall
wait
until
conditions
are
favourable
when
will
that
be
inquired
the
little
prince
hum
hum
replied
the
king
and
before
saying
anything
else
he
consulted
a
bulky
almanac
hum
hum
that
will
be
about
about
that
will
be
this
evening
about
twenty
minutes
to
eight
and
you
will
see
how
well
i
am
obeyed
the
little
prince
yawned
he
was
regretting
his
lost
sunset
and
then
too
he
was
already
beginning
to
be
a
little
bored
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
here
he
said
to
the
king
so
i
shall
set
out
on
my
way
again
do
not
go
said
the
king
who
was
very
proud
of
having
a
subject
do
not
go
i
will
make
you
a
minister
minister
of
what
minster
ofof
justice
but
there
is
nobody
here
to
judge
we
do
not
know
that
the
king
said
to
him
i
have
not
yet
made
a
complete
tour
of
my
kingdom
i
am
very
old
there
is
no
room
here
for
a
carriage
and
it
tires
me
to
walk
oh
but
i
have
looked
already
said
the
little
prince
turning
around
to
give
one
more
glance
to
the
other
side
of
the
planet
on
that
side
as
on
this
there
was
nobody
at
all
then
you
shall
judge
yourself
the
king
answered
that
is
the
most
difficult
thing
of
all
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
j
udge
oneself
than
to
j
udge
others
if
you
succeed
in
j
udging
yourself
rightly
then
you
are
indeed
a
man
of
true
wisdom
yes
said
the
little
prince
but
i
can
judge
myself
anywhere
i
do
not
need
to
live
on
this
planet
hum
hum
said
the
king
i
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
somewhere
on
my
planet
there
is
an
old
rat
i
hear
him
at
night
you
can
judge
this
old
rat
from
time
to
time
you
will
condemn
him
to
death
thus
his
life
will
depend
on
your
j
ustice
but
you
will
pardon
him
on
each
occasion
for
he
must
be
treated
thriftily
he
is
the
only
one
we
have
i
replied
the
little
prince
do
not
like
to
condemn
anyone
to
death
and
now
i
think
i
will
go
on
my
way
no
said
the
king
but
the
little
prince
having
now
completed
his
preparations
for
departure
had
no
wish
to
grieve
the
old
monarch
if
your
majesty
wishes
to
be
promptly
obeyed
he
said
he
should
be
able
to
give
me
a
reasonable
order
he
should
be
able
for
example
to
order
me
to
be
gone
by
the
end
of
one
minute
it
seems
to
me
that
conditions
are
favourable
as
the
king
made
no
answer
the
little
prince
hesitated
a
moment
then
with
a
sigh
he
took
his
leave
i
made
you
my
ambassador
the
king
called
out
hastily
he
had
a
magnificent
air
of
authority
the
grownups
are
very
strange
the
little
prince
said
to
himself
as
he
continued
on
his
journey
the
second
planet
was
inhabited
by
a
conceited
man
ah
ah
i
am
about
to
receive
a
visit
from
an
admirer
he
exclaimed
from
afar
when
he
first
saw
the
little
prince
coming
for
to
conceited
men
all
other
men
are
admirers
good
morning
said
the
little
prince
that
is
a
queer
hat
you
are
wearing
it
is
a
hat
for
salutes
the
conceited
man
replied
it
is
to
raise
in
salute
when
people
acclaim
me
unfortunately
nobody
at
all
ever
passes
this
way
yes
said
the
little
prince
who
did
not
understand
what
the
conceited
man
was
talking
about
clap
your
hands
one
against
the
other
the
conceited
man
now
directed
him
the
little
prince
clapped
his
hands
the
conceited
man
raised
his
hat
in
a
modest
salute
this
is
more
entertaining
than
the
visit
to
the
king
the
little
prince
said
to
himself
and
he
began
again
to
clap
his
hands
one
against
the
other
the
conceited
man
against
raised
his
hat
in
salute
after
five
minutes
of
this
exercise
the
little
prince
grew
tired
of
the
games
monotony
and
what
should
one
do
to
make
the
hat
come
down
he
asked
but
the
conceited
man
did
not
hear
him
conceited
people
never
hear
anything
but
praise
do
you
really
admire
me
very
much
he
demanded
of
the
little
prince
what
does
that
mean
admire
to
admire
means
that
you
regard
me
as
the
handsomest
the
bestdressed
the
richest
and
the
most
intelligent
man
on
this
planet
but
you
are
the
only
man
on
your
planet
do
me
this
kindness
admire
me
just
the
same
i
admire
you
said
the
little
prince
shrugging
his
shoulders
slightly
but
what
is
there
in
that
to
interest
you
so
much
and
the
little
prince
went
away
the
grownups
are
certainly
very
odd
he
said
to
himself
as
he
continued
on
his
journey
the
next
planet
was
inhabited
by
a
tippler
this
was
a
very
short
visit
but
it
plunged
the
little
prince
into
deep
dejection
what
are
you
doing
there
he
said
to
the
tippler
whom
he
found
settled
down
in
silence
before
a
collection
of
empty
bottles
and
also
a
collection
of
full
bottles
i
am
drinking
replied
the
tippler
with
a
lugubrious
air
why
are
you
drinking
demanded
the
little
prince
so
that
i
may
forget
replied
the
tippler
forget
what
inquired
the
little
prince
who
already
was
sorry
for
him
forget
that
i
am
ashamed
the
tippler
confessed
hanging
his
head
ashamed
of
what
insisted
the
little
prince
who
wanted
to
help
him
ashamed
of
drinking
the
tippler
brought
his
speech
to
an
end
and
shut
himself
up
in
an
impregnable
silence
and
the
little
prince
went
away
puzzled
the
grownups
are
certainly
very
very
odd
he
said
to
himself
as
he
continued
on
his
journey
the
fourth
planet
belonged
to
a
businessman
this
man
was
so
much
occupied
that
he
did
not
even
raise
his
head
at
the
little
princes
arrival
good
morning
the
little
prince
said
to
him
your
cigarette
has
gone
out
three
and
two
make
five
five
and
seven
make
twelve
twelve
and
three
make

and
six
make

phew

then
that

what
asked
the
little
prince
eh
are
you
still
there
fivehundredand
one
million
i
cant
stop
i
have
so
much
to
do
i
am
concerned
with
matters
of
consequence
i
dont
amuse
myself
with
balderdash
two
and
five
make
seven
fivehundredandone
million
what
repeated
the
little
prince
who
never
in
his
life
had
let
go
of
a
question
once
he
had
asked
it
the
businessman
raised
his
head
during
the
fiftyfour
years
that
i
have
inhabited
this
planet
i
have
been
disturbed
only
three
times
the
first
time
was
twentytwo
years
ago
when
some
giddy
goose
fell
from
goodness
knows
where
he
made
the
most
frightful
noise
that
resounded
all
over
the
place
and
i
made
four
mistakes
in
my
addition
the
second
time
eleven
years
ago
i
was
disturbed
by
an
attack
of
rheumatism
i
dont
get
enough
exercise
i
have
no
time
for
loafing
the
third
time
well
this
is
it
i
was
saying
then
five
hundredandone
millions
millions
of
what
the
businessman
suddenly
realised
that
there
was
no
hope
of
being
left
in
peace
until
he
answered
this
question
millions
of
those
little
objects
he
said
which
one
sometimes
sees
in
the
sky
flies
oh
no
little
glittering
objects
bees
oh
no
little
golden
objects
that
set
lazy
men
to
idle
dreaming
as
for
me
i
am
concerned
with
matters
of
consequence
there
is
no
time
for
idle
dreaming
in
my
life
ah
you
mean
the
stars
yes
thats
it
the
stars
and
what
do
you
do
with
fivehundred
millions
of
stars
fivehundredandone
million
sixhundredtwentytwo
thousand
sevenhundredthirtyone
i
am
concerned
with
matters
of
consequence
i
am
accurate
and
what
do
you
do
with
these
stars
what
do
i
do
with
them
yes
nothing
i
own
them
you
own
the
stars
yes
but
i
have
already
seen
a
king
who
kings
do
not
own
they
reign
over
it
is
a
very
different
matter
and
what
good
does
it
do
you
to
own
the
stars
it
does
me
the
good
of
making
me
rich
and
what
good
does
it
do
you
to
be
rich
it
makes
it
possible
for
me
to
buy
more
stars
if
any
are
ever
discovered
this
man
the
little
prince
said
to
himself
reasons
a
little
like
my
poor
tippler
nevertheless
he
still
had
some
more
questions
how
is
it
possible
for
one
to
own
the
stars
to
whom
do
they
belong
the
businessman
retorted
peevishly
i
dont
know
to
nobody
then
they
belong
to
me
because
i
was
the
first
person
to
think
of
it
is
that
all
that
is
necessary
certainly
when
you
find
a
diamond
that
belongs
to
nobody
it
is
yours
when
you
discover
an
island
that
belongs
to
nobody
it
is
yours
when
you
get
an
idea
before
any
one
else
you
take
out
a
patent
on
it
it
is
yours
so
with
me
i
own
the
stars
because
nobody
else
before
me
ever
thought
of
owning
them
yes
that
is
true
said
the
little
prince
and
what
do
you
do
with
them
i
administer
them
replied
the
businessman
i
count
them
and
recount
them
it
is
difficult
but
i
am
a
man
who
is
naturally
interested
in
matters
of
consequence
the
little
prince
was
still
not
satisfied
if
i
owned
a
silk
scarf
he
said
i
could
put
it
around
my
neck
and
take
it
away
with
me
if
i
owned
a
flower
i
could
pluck
that
flower
and
take
it
away
with
me
but
you
cannot
pluck
the
stars
from
heaven
no
but
i
can
put
them
in
the
bank
whatever
does
that
mean
that
means
that
i
write
the
number
of
my
stars
on
a
little
paper
and
then
i
put
this
paper
in
a
drawer
and
lock
it
with
a
key
and
that
is
all
that
is
enough
said
the
businessman
it
is
entertaining
thought
the
little
prince
it
is
rather
poetic
but
it
is
of
no
great
consequence
on
matters
of
consequence
the
little
prince
had
ideas
which
were
very
different
from
those
of
the
grownups
i
myself
own
a
flower
he
continued
his
conversation
with
the
businessman
which
i
water
every
day
i
own
three
volcanoes
which
i
clean
out
every
week
for
i
also
clean
out
the
one
that
is
extinct
one
never
knows
it
is
of
some
use
to
my
volcanoes
and
it
is
of
some
use
to
my
flower
that
i
own
them
but
you
are
of
no
use
to
the
stars
the
businessman
opened
his
mouth
but
he
found
nothing
to
say
in
answer
and
the
little
prince
went
away
the
grownups
are
certainly
altogether
extraordinary
he
said
simply
talking
to
himself
as
he
continued
on
his
journey
the
fifth
planet
was
very
strange
it
was
the
smallest
of
all
there
was
just
enough
room
on
it
for
a
street
lamp
and
a
lamplighter
the
little
prince
was
not
able
to
reach
any
explanation
of
the
use
of
a
street
lamp
and
a
lamplighter
somewhere
in
the
heavens
on
a
planet
which
had
no
people
and
not
one
house
but
he
said
to
himself
nevertheless
it
may
well
be
that
this
man
is
absurd
but
he
is
not
so
absurd
as
the
king
the
conceited
man
the
businessman
and
the
tippler
for
at
least
his
work
has
some
meaning
when
he
lights
his
street
lamp
it
is
as
if
he
brought
one
more
star
to
life
or
one
flower
when
he
puts
out
his
lamp
he
sends
the
flower
or
the
star
to
sleep
that
is
a
beautiful
occupation
and
since
it
is
beautiful
it
is
truly
useful
when
he
arrived
on
the
planet
he
respectfully
saluted
the
lamplighter
good
morning
why
have
you
just
put
out
your
lamp
those
are
the
orders
replied
the
lamplighter
good
morning
what
are
the
orders
the
orders
are
that
i
put
out
my
lamp
good
evening
and
he
lighted
his
lamp
again
but
why
have
you
just
lighted
it
again
those
are
the
orders
replied
the
lamplighter
i
do
not
understand
said
the
little
prince
there
is
nothing
to
understand
said
the
lamplighter
orders
are
orders
good
morning
and
he
put
out
his
lamp
then
he
mopped
his
forehead
with
a
handkerchief
decorated
with
red
squares
i
follow
a
terrible
profession
in
the
old
days
it
was
reasonable
i
put
the
lamp
out
in
the
morning
and
in
the
evening
i
lighted
it
again
i
had
the
rest
of
the
day
for
relaxation
and
the
rest
of
the
night
for
sleep
and
the
orders
have
been
changed
since
that
time
the
orders
have
not
been
changed
said
the
lamplighter
that
is
the
tragedy
from
year
to
year
the
planet
has
turned
more
rapidly
and
the
orders
have
not
been
changed
then
what
asked
the
little
prince
then
the
planet
now
makes
a
complete
turn
every
minute
and
i
no
longer
have
a
single
second
for
repose
once
every
minute
i
have
to
light
my
lamp
and
put
it
out
that
is
very
funny
a
day
lasts
only
one
minute
here
where
you
live
it
is
not
funny
at
all
said
the
lamplighter
while
we
have
been
talking
together
a
month
has
gone
by
a
month
yes
a
month
thirty
minutes
thirty
days
good
evening
and
he
lighted
his
lamp
again
as
the
little
prince
watched
him
he
felt
that
he
loved
this
lamplighter
who
was
so
faithful
to
his
orders
he
remembered
the
sunsets
which
he
himself
had
gone
to
seek
in
other
days
merely
by
pulling
up
his
chair
and
he
wanted
to
help
his
friend
you
know
he
said
i
can
tell
you
a
way
you
can
rest
whenever
you
want
to
i
always
want
to
rest
said
the
lamplighter
for
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
be
faithful
and
lazy
at
the
same
time
the
little
prince
went
on
with
his
explanation
your
planet
is
so
small
that
three
strides
will
take
you
all
the
way
around
it
to
be
always
in
the
sunshine
you
need
only
walk
along
rather
slowly
when
you
want
to
rest
you
will
walk
and
the
day
will
last
as
long
as
you
like
that
doesnt
do
me
much
good
said
the
lamplighter
the
one
thing
i
love
in
life
is
to
sleep
then
youre
unlucky
said
the
little
prince
i
am
unlucky
said
the
lamplighter
good
morning
and
he
put
out
his
lamp
that
man
said
the
little
prince
to
himself
as
he
continued
farther
on
his
journey
that
man
would
be
scorned
by
all
the
others
by
the
king
by
the
conceited
man
by
the
tippler
by
the
businessman
nevertheless
he
is
the
only
one
of
them
all
who
does
not
seem
to
me
ridiculous
perhaps
that
is
because
he
is
thinking
of
something
else
besides
himself
he
breathed
a
sigh
of
regret
and
said
to
himself
again
that
man
is
the
only
one
of
them
all
whom
i
could
have
made
my
friend
but
his
planet
is
indeed
too
small
there
is
no
room
on
it
for
two
people
what
the
little
prince
did
not
dare
confess
was
that
he
was
sorry
most
of
all
to
leave
this
planet
because
it
was
blest
every
day
with

sunsets
the
sixth
planet
was
ten
times
larger
than
the
last
one
it
was
inhabited
by
an
old
gentleman
who
wrote
voluminous
books
oh
look
here
is
an
explorer
he
exclaimed
to
himself
when
he
saw
the
little
prince
coming
the
little
prince
sat
down
on
the
table
and
panted
a
little
he
had
already
travelled
so
much
and
so
far
where
do
you
come
from
the
old
gentleman
said
to
him
what
is
that
big
book
said
the
little
prince
what
are
you
doing
i
am
a
geographer
the
old
gentleman
said
to
him
what
is
a
geographer
asked
the
little
prince
a
geographer
is
a
scholar
who
knows
the
location
of
all
the
seas
rivers
towns
mountains
and
deserts
that
is
very
interesting
said
the
little
prince
here
at
last
is
a
man
who
has
a
real
profession
and
he
cast
a
look
around
him
at
the
planet
of
the
geographer
it
was
the
most
magnificent
and
stately
planet
that
he
had
ever
seen
your
planet
is
very
beautiful
he
said
has
it
any
oceans
i
couldnt
tell
you
said
the
geographer
ah
the
little
prince
was
disappointed
has
it
any
mountains
i
couldnt
tell
you
said
the
geographer
and
towns
and
rivers
and
deserts
i
couldnt
tell
you
that
either
but
you
are
a
geographer
exactly
the
geographer
said
but
i
am
not
an
explorer
i
havent
a
single
explorer
on
my
planet
it
is
not
the
geographer
who
goes
out
to
count
the
towns
the
rivers
the
mountains
the
seas
the
oceans
and
the
deserts
the
geographer
is
much
too
important
to
go
loafing
about
he
does
not
leave
his
desk
but
he
receives
the
explorers
in
his
study
he
asks
them
questions
and
he
notes
down
what
they
recall
of
their
travels
and
if
the
recollections
of
any
one
among
them
seem
interesting
to
him
the
geographer
orders
an
inquiry
into
that
explorers
moral
character
why
is
that
because
an
explorer
who
told
lies
would
bring
disaster
on
the
books
of
the
geographer
so
would
an
explorer
who
drank
too
much
why
is
that
asked
the
little
prince
because
intoxicated
men
see
double
then
the
geographer
would
note
down
two
mountains
in
a
place
where
there
was
only
one
i
know
some
one
said
the
little
prince
who
would
make
a
bad
explorer
that
is
possible
then
when
the
moral
character
of
the
explorer
is
shown
to
be
good
an
inquiry
is
ordered
into
his
discovery
one
goes
to
see
it
no
that
would
be
too
complicated
but
one
requires
the
explorer
to
furnish
proofs
for
example
if
the
discovery
in
question
is
that
of
a
large
mountain
one
requires
that
large
stones
be
brought
back
from
it
the
geographer
was
suddenly
stirred
to
excitement
but
you
come
from
far
away
you
are
an
explorer
you
shall
describe
your
planet
to
me
and
having
opened
his
big
register
the
geographer
sharpened
his
pencil
the
recitals
of
explorers
are
put
down
first
in
pencil
one
waits
until
the
explorer
has
furnished
proofs
before
putting
them
down
in
ink
well
said
the
geographer
expectantly
oh
where
i
live
said
the
little
prince
it
is
not
very
interesting
it
is
all
so
small
i
have
three
volcanoes
two
volcanoes
are
active
and
the
other
is
extinct
but
one
never
knows
one
never
knows
said
the
geographer
i
have
also
a
flower
we
do
not
record
flowers
said
the
geographer
why
is
that
the
flower
is
the
most
beautiful
thing
on
my
planet
we
do
not
record
them
said
the
geographer
because
they
are
ephemeral
what
does
that
mean
ephemeral
geographies
said
the
geographer
are
the
books
which
of
all
books
are
most
concerned
with
matters
of
consequence
they
never
become
oldfashioned
it
is
very
rarely
that
a
mountain
changes
its
position
it
is
very
rarely
that
an
ocean
empties
itself
of
its
waters
we
write
of
eternal
things
but
extinct
volcanoes
may
come
to
life
again
the
little
prince
interrupted
what
does
that
mean
ephemeral
whether
volcanoes
are
extinct
or
alive
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
for
us
said
the
geographer
the
thing
that
matters
to
us
is
the
mountain
it
does
not
change
but
what
does
that
mean
ephemeral
repeated
the
little
prince
who
never
in
his
life
had
let
go
of
a
question
once
he
had
asked
it
it
means
which
is
in
danger
of
speedy
disappearance

is
my
flower
in
danger
of
speedy
disappearance
certainly
it
is
my
flower
is
ephemeral
the
little
prince
said
to
himself
and
she
has
only
four
thorns
to
defend
herself
against
the
world
and
i
have
left
her
on
my
planet
all
alone
that
was
his
first
moment
of
regret
but
he
took
courage
once
more
what
place
would
you
advise
me
to
visit
now
he
asked
the
planet
earth
replied
the
geographer
it
has
a
good
reputation
and
the
little
prince
went
away
thinking
of
his
flower
so
then
the
seventh
planet
was
the
earth
the
earth
is
not
just
an
ordinary
planet
one
can
count
there

kings
not
forgetting
to
be
sure
the
negro
kings
among
them

geographers

businessmen

tipplers

conceited
men
that
is
to
say
about

grownups
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
size
of
the
earth
i
will
tell
you
that
before
the
invention
of
electricity
it
was
necessary
to
maintain
over
the
whole
of
the
six
continents
a
veritable
army
of

lamplighters
for
the
street
lamps
seen
from
a
slight
distance
that
would
make
a
splendid
spectacle
the
movements
of
this
army
would
be
regulated
like
those
of
the
ballet
in
the
opera
first
would
come
the
turn
of
the
lamplighters
of
new
zealand
and
australia
having
set
their
lamps
alight
these
would
go
off
to
sleep
next
the
lamplighters
of
china
and
siberia
would
enter
for
their
steps
in
the
dance
and
then
they
too
would
be
waved
back
into
the
wings
after
that
would
come
the
turn
of
the
lamplighters
of
russia
and
the
indies
then
those
of
africa
and
europe
then
those
of
south
america
then
those
of
north
america
and
never
would
they
make
a
mistake
in
the
order
of
their
entry
upon
the
stage
it
would
be
magnificent
only
the
man
who
was
in
charge
of
the
single
lamp
at
the
north
pole
and
his
colleague
who
was
responsible
for
the
single
lamp
at
the
south
pole
only
these
two
would
live
free
from
toil
and
care
they
would
be
busy
twice
a
year
when
one
wishes
to
play
the
wit
he
sometimes
wanders
a
little
from
the
truth
i
have
not
been
altogether
honest
in
what
i
have
told
you
about
the
lamplighters
and
i
realise
that
i
run
the
risk
of
giving
a
false
idea
of
our
planet
to
those
who
do
not
know
it
men
occupy
a
very
small
place
upon
the
earth
if
the
two
billion
inhabitants
who
people
its
surface
were
all
to
stand
upright
and
somewhat
crowded
together
as
they
do
for
some
big
public
assembly
they
could
easily
be
put
into
one
public
square
twenty
miles
long
and
twenty
miles
wide
all
humanity
could
be
piled
up
on
a
small
pacific
islet
the
grownups
to
be
sure
will
not
believe
you
when
you
tell
them
that
they
imagine
that
they
fill
a
great
deal
of
space
they
fancy
themselves
as
important
as
the
baobabs
you
should
advise
them
then
to
make
their
own
calculations
they
adore
figures
and
that
will
please
them
but
do
not
waste
your
time
on
this
extra
task
it
is
unnecessary
you
have
i
know
confidence
in
me
when
the
little
prince
arrived
on
the
earth
he
was
very
much
surprised
not
to
see
any
people
he
was
beginning
to
be
afraid
he
had
come
to
the
wrong
planet
when
a
coil
of
gold
the
colour
of
the
moonlight
flashed
across
the
sand
good
evening
said
the
little
prince
courteously
good
evening
said
the
snake
what
planet
is
this
on
which
i
have
come
down
asked
the
little
prince
this
is
the
earth
this
is
africa
the
snake
answered
ah
then
there
are
no
people
on
the
earth
this
is
the
desert
there
are
no
people
in
the
desert
the
earth
is
large
said
the
snake
the
little
prince
sat
down
on
a
stone
and
raised
his
eyes
toward
the
sky
i
wonder
he
said
whether
the
stars
are
set
alight
in
heaven
so
that
one
day
each
one
of
us
may
find
his
own
again
look
at
my
planet
it
is
right
there
above
us
but
how
far
away
it
is
it
is
beautiful
the
snake
said
what
has
brought
you
here
i
have
been
having
some
trouble
with
a
flower
said
the
little
prince
ah
said
the
snake
and
they
were
both
silent
where
are
the
men
the
little
prince
at
last
took
up
the
conversation
again
it
is
a
little
lonely
in
the
desert
it
is
also
lonely
among
men
the
snake
said
the
little
prince
gazed
at
him
for
a
long
time
you
are
a
funny
animal
he
said
at
last
you
are
no
thicker
than
a
finger
but
i
am
more
powerful
than
the
finger
of
a
king
said
the
snake
the
little
prince
smiled
you
are
not
very
powerful
you
havent
even
any
feet
you
cannot
even
travel
i
can
carry
you
farther
than
any
ship
could
take
you
said
the
snake
he
twined
himself
around
the
little
princes
ankle
like
a
golden
bracelet
whomever
i
touch
i
send
back
to
the
earth
from
whence
he
came
the
snake
spoke
again
but
you
are
innocent
and
true
and
you
come
from
a
star
the
little
prince
made
no
reply
you
move
me
to
pity
you
are
so
weak
on
this
earth
made
of
granite
the
snake
said
i
can
help
you
some
day
if
you
grow
too
homesick
for
your
own
planet
i
can
oh
i
understand
you
very
well
said
the
little
prince
but
why
do
you
always
speak
in
riddles
i
solve
them
all
said
the
snake
and
they
were
both
silent
the
little
prince
crossed
the
desert
and
met
with
only
one
flower
it
was
a
flower
with
three
petals
a
flower
of
no
account
at
all
good
morning
said
the
little
prince
good
morning
said
the
flower
where
are
the
men
the
little
prince
asked
politely
the
flower
had
once
seen
a
caravan
passing
men
she
echoed
i
think
there
are
six
or
seven
of
them
in
existence
i
saw
them
several
years
ago
but
one
never
knows
where
to
find
them
the
wind
blows
them
away
they
have
no
roots
and
that
makes
their
life
very
difficult
goodbye
said
the
little
prince
goodbye
said
the
flower
after
that
the
little
prince
climbed
a
high
mountain
the
only
mountains
he
had
ever
known
were
the
three
volcanoes
which
came
up
to
his
knees
and
he
used
the
extinct
volcano
as
a
footstool
from
a
mountain
as
high
as
this
one
he
said
to
himself
i
shall
be
able
to
see
the
whole
planet
at
one
glance
and
all
the
people
but
he
saw
nothing
save
peaks
of
rock
that
were
sharpened
like
needles
good
morning
he
said
courteously
good
morninggood
morninggood
morning
answered
the
echo
who
are
you
said
the
little
prince
who
are
youwho
are
youwho
are
you
answered
the
echo
be
my
friends
i
am
all
alone
he
said
i
am
all
aloneall
alone
all
alone
answered
the
echo
what
a
queer
planet
he
thought
it
is
altogether
dry
and
altogether
pointed
and
altogether
harsh
and
forbidding
and
the
people
have
no
imagination
they
repeat
whatever
one
says
to
them
on
my
planet
i
had
a
flower
she
always
was
the
first
to
speak
but
it
happened
that
after
walking
for
a
long
time
through
sand
and
rocks
and
snow
the
little
prince
at
last
came
upon
a
road
and
all
roads
lead
to
the
abodes
of
men
good
morning
he
said
he
was
standing
before
a
garden
all
abloom
with
roses
good
morning
said
the
roses
the
little
prince
gazed
at
them
they
all
looked
like
his
flower
who
are
you
he
demanded
thunderstruck
we
are
roses
the
roses
said
and
he
was
overcome
with
sadness
his
flower
had
told
him
that
she
was
the
only
one
of
her
kind
in
all
the
universe
and
here
were
five
thousand
of
them
all
alike
in
one
single
garden
she
would
be
very
much
annoyed
he
said
to
himself
if
she
should
see
that
she
would
cough
most
dreadfully
and
she
would
pretend
that
she
was
dying
to
avoid
being
laughed
at
and
i
should
be
obliged
to
pretend
that
i
was
nursing
her
back
to
life
for
if
i
did
not
do
that
to
humble
myself
also
she
would
really
allow
herself
to
die
then
he
went
on
with
his
reflections
i
thought
that
i
was
rich
with
a
flower
that
was
unique
in
all
the
world
and
all
i
had
was
a
common
rose
a
common
rose
and
three
volcanoes
that
come
up
to
my
knees

and
one
of
them
perhaps
extinct
forever
that
doesnt
make
me
a
very
great
prince
and
he
lay
down
in
the
grass
and
cried
it
was
then
that
the
fox
appeared
good
morning
said
the
fox
good
morning
the
little
prince
responded
politely
although
when
he
turned
around
he
saw
nothing
i
am
right
here
the
voice
said
under
the
apple
tree

who
are
you
asked
the
little
prince
and
added
you
are
very
pretty
to
look
at
i
am
a
fox
said
the
fox
come
and
play
with
me
proposed
the
little
prince
i
am
so
unhappy
i
cannot
play
with
you
the
fox
said
i
am
not
tamed
ah
please
excuse
me
said
the
little
prince
but
after
some
thought
he
added
what
does
that
mean
tame
you
do
not
live
here
said
the
fox
what
is
it
that
you
are
looking
for
i
am
looking
for
men
said
the
little
prince
what
does
that
mean
tame
men
said
the
fox
they
have
guns
and
they
hunt
it
is
very
disturbing
they
also
raise
chickens
these
are
their
only
interests
are
you
looking
for
chickens
no
said
the
little
prince
i
am
looking
for
friends
what
does
that
mean
tame
it
is
an
act
too
often
neglected
said
the
fox
it
means
to
establish
ties
to
establish
ties
just
that
said
the
fox
to
me
you
are
still
nothing
more
than
a
little
boy
who
is
just
like
a
hundred
thousand
other
little
boys
and
i
have
no
need
of
you
and
you
on
your
part
have
no
need
of
me
to
you
i
am
nothing
more
than
a
fox
like
a
hundred
thousand
other
foxes
but
if
you
tame
me
then
we
shall
need
each
other
to
me
you
will
be
unique
in
all
the
world
to
you
i
shall
be
unique
in
all
the
world
i
am
beginning
to
understand
said
the
little
prince
there
is
a
flower
i
think
that
she
has
tamed
me
it
is
possible
said
the
fox
on
the
earth
one
sees
all
sorts
of
things
oh
but
this
is
not
on
the
earth
said
the
little
prince
the
fox
seemed
perplexed
and
very
curious
on
another
planet
yes
are
there
hunters
on
this
planet
no
ah
that
is
interesting
are
there
chickens
no
nothing
is
perfect
sighed
the
fox
but
he
came
back
to
his
idea
my
life
is
very
monotonous
the
fox
said
i
hunt
chickens
men
hunt
me
all
the
chickens
are
just
alike
and
all
the
men
are
just
alike
and
in
consequence
i
am
a
little
bored
but
if
you
tame
me
it
will
be
as
if
the
sun
came
to
shine
on
my
life
i
shall
know
the
sound
of
a
step
that
will
be
different
from
all
the
others
other
steps
send
me
hurrying
back
underneath
the
ground
yours
will
call
me
like
music
out
of
my
burrow
and
then
look
you
see
the
grainfields
down
yonder
i
do
not
eat
bread
wheat
is
of
no
use
to
me
the
wheat
fields
have
nothing
to
say
to
me
and
that
is
sad
but
you
have
hair
that
is
the
colour
of
gold
think
how
wonderful
that
will
be
when
you
have
tamed
me
the
grain
which
is
also
golden
will
bring
me
back
the
thought
of
you
and
i
shall
love
to
listen
to
the
wind
in
the
wheat
the
fox
gazed
at
the
little
prince
for
a
long
time
please
tame
me
he
said
i
want
to
very
much
the
little
prince
replied
but
i
have
not
much
time
i
have
friends
to
discover
and
a
great
many
things
to
understand
one
only
understands
the
things
that
one
tames
said
the
fox
men
have
no
more
time
to
understand
anything
they
buy
things
all
readymade
at
the
shops
but
there
is
no
shop
anywhere
where
one
can
buy
friendship
and
so
men
have
no
friends
any
more
if
you
want
a
friend
tame
me
what
must
i
do
to
tame
you
asked
the
little
prince
you
must
be
very
patient
replied
the
fox
first
you
will
sit
down
at
a
little
distance
from
me
like
that
in
the
grass
i
shall
look
at
you
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
and
you
will
say
nothing
words
are
the
source
of
misunderstandings
but
you
will
sit
a
little
closer
to
me
every
day
the
next
day
the
little
prince
came
back
it
would
have
been
better
to
come
back
at
the
same
hour
said
the
fox
if
for
example
you
come
at
four
oclock
in
the
afternoon
then
at
three
oclock
i
shall
begin
to
be
happy
i
shall
feel
happier
and
happier
as
the
hour
advances
at
four
oclock
i
shall
already
be
worrying
and
jumping
about
i
shall
show
you
how
happy
i
am
but
if
you
come
at
just
any
time
i
shall
never
know
at
what
hour
my
heart
is
to
be
ready
to
greet
you
one
must
observe
the
proper
rites
what
is
a
rite
asked
the
little
prince
those
also
are
actions
too
often
neglected
said
the
fox
they
are
what
make
one
day
different
from
other
days
one
hour
from
other
hours
there
is
a
rite
for
example
among
my
hunters
every
thursday
they
dance
with
the
village
girls
so
thursday
is
a
wonderful
day
for
me
i
can
take
a
walk
as
far
as
the
vineyards
but
if
the
hunters
danced
at
just
any
time
every
day
would
be
like
every
other
day
and
i
should
never
have
any
vacation
at
all
so
the
little
prince
tamed
the
fox
and
when
the
hour
of
his
departure
drew
near
ah
said
the
fox
i
shall
cry
it
is
your
own
fault
said
the
little
prince
i
never
wished
you
any
sort
of
harm
but
you
wanted
me
to
tame
you
yes
that
is
so
said
the
fox
but
now
you
are
going
to
cry
said
the
little
prince
yes
that
is
so
said
the
fox
then
it
has
done
you
no
good
at
all
it
has
done
me
good
said
the
fox
because
of
the
colour
of
the
wheat
fields
and
then
he
added
go
and
look
again
at
the
roses
you
will
understand
now
that
yours
is
unique
in
all
the
world
then
come
back
to
say
goodbye
to
me
and
i
will
make
you
a
present
of
a
secret
the
little
prince
went
away
to
look
again
at
the
roses
you
are
not
at
all
like
my
rose
he
said
as
yet
you
are
nothing
no
one
has
tamed
you
and
you
have
tamed
no
one
you
are
like
my
fox
when
i
first
knew
him
he
was
only
a
fox
like
a
hundred
thousand
other
foxes
but
i
have
made
him
my
friend
and
now
he
is
unique
in
all
the
world
and
the
roses
were
very
much
embarrassed
you
are
beautiful
but
you
are
empty
he
went
on
one
could
not
die
for
you
to
be
sure
an
ordinary
passerby
would
think
that
my
rose
looked
just
like
you
the
rose
that
belongs
to
me
but
in
herself
alone
she
is
more
important
than
all
the
hundreds
of
you
other
roses
because
it
is
she
that
i
have
watered
because
it
is
she
that
i
have
put
under
the
glass
globe
because
it
is
she
that
i
have
sheltered
behind
the
screen
because
it
is
for
her
that
i
have
killed
the
caterpillars
except
the
two
or
three
that
we
saved
to
become
butterflies
because
it
is
she
that
i
have
listened
to
when
she
grumbled
or
boasted
or
even
sometimes
when
she
said
nothing
because
she
is
my
rose
and
he
went
back
to
meet
the
fox
goodbye
he
said
goodbye
said
the
fox
and
now
here
is
my
secret
a
very
simple
secret
it
is
only
with
the
heart
that
one
can
see
rightly
what
is
essential
is
invisible
to
the
eye
what
is
essential
is
invisible
to
the
eye
the
little
prince
repeated
so
that
he
would
be
sure
to
remember
it
is
the
time
you
have
wasted
for
your
rose
that
makes
your
rose
so
important
it
is
the
time
i
have
wasted
for
my
rose
said
the
little
prince
so
that
he
would
be
sure
to
remember
men
have
forgotten
this
truth
said
the
fox
but
you
must
not
forget
it
you
become
responsible
forever
for
what
you
have
tamed
you
are
responsible
for
your
rose
i
am
responsible
for
my
rose
the
little
prince
repeated
so
that
he
would
be
sure
to
remember
good
morning
said
the
little
prince
good
morning
said
the
railway
switchman
what
do
you
do
here
the
little
prince
asked
i
sort
out
travellers
in
bundles
of
a
thousand
said
the
switchman
i
send
off
the
trains
that
carry
them
now
to
the
right
now
to
the
left
and
a
brilliantly
lighted
express
train
shook
the
switchmans
cabin
as
it
rushed
by
with
a
roar
like
thunder
they
are
in
a
great
hurry
said
the
little
prince
what
are
they
looking
for
not
even
the
locomotive
engineer
knows
that
said
the
switchman
and
a
second
brilliantly
lighted
express
thundered
by
in
the
opposite
direction
are
they
coming
back
already
demanded
the
little
prince
these
are
not
the
same
ones
said
the
switchman
it
is
an
exchange
were
they
not
satisfied
where
they
were
asked
the
little
prince
no
one
is
ever
satisfied
where
he
is
said
the
switchman
and
they
heard
the
roaring
thunder
of
a
third
brilliantly
lighted
express
are
they
pursuing
the
first
travellers
demanded
the
little
prince
they
are
pursuing
nothing
at
all
said
the
switchman
they
are
asleep
in
there
or
if
they
are
not
asleep
they
are
yawning
only
the
children
are
flattening
their
noses
against
the
windowpanes
only
the
children
know
what
they
are
looking
for
said
the
little
prince
they
waste
their
time
over
a
rag
doll
and
it
becomes
very
important
to
them
and
if
anybody
takes
it
away
from
them
they
cry
they
are
lucky
the
switchman
said
good
morning
said
the
little
prince
good
morning
said
the
merchant
this
was
a
merchant
who
sold
pills
that
had
been
invented
to
quench
thirst
you
need
only
swallow
one
pill
a
week
and
you
would
feel
no
need
of
anything
to
drink
why
are
you
selling
those
asked
the
little
prince
because
they
save
a
tremendous
amount
of
time
said
the
merchant
computations
have
been
made
by
experts
with
these
pills
you
save
fiftythree
minutes
in
every
week
and
what
do
i
do
with
those
fiftythree
minutes
anything
you
like
as
for
me
said
the
little
prince
to
himself
if
i
had
fiftythree
minutes
to
spend
as
i
liked
i
should
walk
at
my
leisure
toward
a
spring
of
fresh
water
it
was
now
the
eighth
day
since
i
had
had
my
accident
in
the
desert
and
i
had
listened
to
the
story
of
the
merchant
as
i
was
drinking
the
last
drop
of
my
water
supply
ah
i
said
to
the
little
prince
these
memories
of
yours
are
very
charming
but
i
have
not
yet
succeeded
in
repairing
my
plane
i
have
nothing
more
to
drink
and
i
too
should
be
very
happy
if
i
could
walk
at
my
leisure
toward
a
spring
of
fresh
water
my
friend
the
fox
the
little
prince
said
to
me
my
dear
little
man
this
is
no
longer
a
matter
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
fox
why
not
because
i
am
about
to
die
of
thirst
he
did
not
follow
my
reasoning
and
he
answered
me
it
is
a
good
thing
to
have
had
a
friend
even
if
one
is
about
to
die
i
for
instance
am
very
glad
to
have
had
a
fox
as
a
friend
he
has
no
way
of
guessing
the
danger
i
said
to
myself
he
has
never
been
either
hungry
or
thirsty
a
little
sunshine
is
all
he
needs
but
he
looked
at
me
steadily
and
replied
to
my
thought
i
am
thirsty
too
let
us
look
for
a
well
i
made
a
gesture
of
weariness
it
is
absurd
to
look
for
a
well
at
random
in
the
immensity
of
the
desert
but
nevertheless
we
started
walking
when
we
had
trudged
along
for
several
hours
in
silence
the
darkness
fell
and
the
stars
began
to
come
out
thirst
had
made
me
a
little
feverish
and
i
looked
at
them
as
if
i
were
in
a
dream
the
little
princes
last
words
came
reeling
back
into
my
memory
then
you
are
thirsty
too
i
demanded
but
he
did
not
reply
to
my
question
he
merely
said
to
me
water
may
also
be
good
for
the
heart
i
did
not
understand
this
answer
but
i
said
nothing
i
knew
very
well
that
it
was
impossible
to
crossexamine
him
he
was
tired
he
sat
down
i
sat
down
beside
him
and
after
a
little
silence
he
spoke
again
the
stars
are
beautiful
because
of
a
flower
that
cannot
be
seen
i
replied
yes
that
is
so
and
without
saying
anything
more
i
looked
across
the
ridges
of
sand
that
were
stretched
out
before
us
in
the
moonlight
the
desert
is
beautiful
the
little
prince
added
and
that
was
true
i
have
always
loved
the
desert
one
sits
down
on
a
desert
sand
dune
sees
nothing
hears
nothing
yet
through
the
silence
something
throbs
and
gleams
what
makes
the
desert
beautiful
said
the
little
prince
is
that
somewhere
it
hides
a
well
i
was
astonished
by
a
sudden
understanding
of
that
mysterious
radiation
of
the
sands
when
i
was
a
little
boy
i
lived
in
an
old
house
and
legend
told
us
that
a
treasure
was
buried
there
to
be
sure
no
one
had
ever
known
how
to
find
it
perhaps
no
one
had
ever
even
looked
for
it
but
it
cast
an
enchantment
over
that
house
my
home
was
hiding
a
secret
in
the
depths
of
its
heart
yes
i
said
to
the
little
prince
the
house
the
stars
the
desert

what
gives
them
their
beauty
is
something
that
is
invisible
i
am
glad
he
said
that
you
agree
with
my
fox
as
the
little
prince
dropped
off
to
sleep
i
took
him
in
my
arms
and
set
out
walking
once
more
i
felt
deeply
moved
and
stirred
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
carrying
a
very
fragile
treasure
it
seemed
to
me
even
that
there
was
nothing
more
fragile
on
all
earth
in
the
moonlight
i
looked
at
his
pale
forehead
his
closed
eyes
his
locks
of
hair
that
trembled
in
the
wind
and
i
said
to
myself
what
i
see
here
is
nothing
but
a
shell
what
is
most
important
is
invisible
as
his
lips
opened
slightly
with
the
suspicious
of
a
halfsmile
i
said
to
myself
again
what
moves
me
so
deeply
about
this
little
prince
who
is
sleeping
here
is
his
loyalty
to
a
flower

the
image
of
a
rose
that
shines
through
his
whole
being
like
the
flame
of
a
lamp
even
when
he
is
asleep
and
i
felt
him
to
be
more
fragile
still
i
felt
the
need
of
protecting
him
as
if
he
himself
were
a
flame
that
might
be
extinguished
by
a
little
puff
of
wind
and
as
i
walked
on
so
i
found
the
well
at
daybreak
men
said
the
little
prince
set
out
on
their
way
in
express
trains
but
they
do
not
know
what
they
are
looking
for
then
they
rush
about
and
get
excited
and
turn
round
and
round
and
he
added
it
is
not
worth
the
trouble
the
well
that
we
had
come
to
was
not
like
the
wells
of
the
sahara
the
wells
of
the
sahara
are
mere
holes
dug
in
the
sand
this
one
was
like
a
well
in
a
village
but
there
was
no
village
here
and
i
thought
i
must
be
dreaming
it
is
strange
i
said
to
the
little
prince
everything
is
ready
for
use
the
pulley
the
bucket
the
rope
he
laughed
touched
the
rope
and
set
the
pulley
to
working
and
the
pulley
moaned
like
an
old
weathervane
which
the
wind
has
long
since
forgotten
do
you
hear
said
the
little
prince
we
have
wakened
the
well
and
it
is
singing
i
did
not
want
him
to
tire
himself
with
the
rope
leave
it
to
me
i
said
it
is
too
heavy
for
you
i
hoisted
the
bucket
slowly
to
the
edge
of
the
well
and
set
it
there
happy
tired
as
i
was
over
my
achievement
the
song
of
the
pulley
was
still
in
my
ears
and
i
could
see
the
sunlight
shimmer
in
the
still
trembling
water
i
am
thirsty
for
this
water
said
the
little
prince
give
me
some
of
it
to
drink
and
i
understood
what
he
had
been
looking
for
i
raised
the
bucket
to
his
lips
he
drank
his
eyes
closed
it
was
as
sweet
as
some
special
festival
treat
this
water
was
indeed
a
different
thing
from
ordinary
nourishment
its
sweetness
was
born
of
the
walk
under
the
stars
the
song
of
the
pulley
the
effort
of
my
arms
it
was
good
for
the
heart
like
a
present
when
i
was
a
little
boy
the
lights
of
the
christmas
tree
the
music
of
the
midnight
mass
the
tenderness
of
smiling
faces
used
to
make
up
so
the
radiance
of
the
gifts
i
received
the
men
where
you
live
said
the
little
prince
raise
five
thousand
roses
in
the
same
garden
and
they
do
not
find
in
it
what
they
are
looking
for
they
do
not
find
it
i
replied
and
yet
what
they
are
looking
for
could
be
found
in
one
single
rose
or
in
a
little
water
yes
that
is
true
i
said
and
the
little
prince
added
but
the
eyes
are
blind
one
must
look
with
the
heart
i
had
drunk
the
water
i
breathed
easily
at
sunrise
the
sand
is
the
colour
of
honey
and
that
honey
colour
was
making
me
happy
too
what
brought
me
then
this
sense
of
grief
you
must
keep
your
promise
said
the
little
prince
softly
as
he
sat
down
beside
me
once
more
what
promise
you
know
a
muzzle
for
my
sheep
i
am
responsible
for
this
flower
i
took
my
rough
drafts
of
drawings
out
of
my
pocket
the
little
prince
looked
them
over
and
laughed
as
he
said
your
baobabs
they
look
a
little
like
cabbages
oh
i
had
been
so
proud
of
my
baobabs
your
fox
his
ears
look
a
little
like
horns
and
they
are
too
long
and
he
laughed
again
you
are
not
fair
little
prince
i
said
i
dont
know
how
to
draw
anything
except
boa
constrictors
from
the
outside
and
boa
constrictors
from
the
inside
oh
that
will
be
all
right
he
said
children
understand
so
then
i
made
a
pencil
sketch
of
a
muzzle
and
as
i
gave
it
to
him
my
heart
was
torn
you
have
plans
that
i
do
not
know
about
i
said
but
he
did
not
answer
me
he
said
to
me
instead
you
know
my
descent
to
the
earth
tomorrow
will
be
its
anniversary
then
after
a
silence
he
went
on
i
came
down
very
near
here
and
he
flushed
and
once
again
without
understanding
why
i
had
a
queer
sense
of
sorrow
one
question
however
occurred
to
me
then
it
was
not
by
chance
that
on
the
morning
when
i
first
met
you

a
week
ago

you
were
strolling
along
like
that
all
alone
a
thousand
miles
from
any
inhabited
region
you
were
on
the
your
way
back
to
the
place
where
you
landed
the
little
prince
flushed
again
and
i
added
with
some
hesitancy
perhaps
it
was
because
of
the
anniversary
the
little
prince
flushed
once
more
he
never
answered
questions
but
when
one
flushes
does
that
not
mean
yes
ah
i
said
to
him
i
am
a
little
frightened
but
he
interrupted
me
now
you
must
work
you
must
return
to
your
engine
i
will
be
waiting
for
you
here
come
back
tomorrow
evening
but
i
was
not
reassured
i
remembered
the
fox
one
runs
the
risk
of
weeping
a
little
if
one
lets
himself
be
tamed
beside
the
well
there
was
the
ruin
of
an
old
stone
wall
when
i
came
back
from
my
work
the
next
evening
i
saw
from
some
distance
away
my
little
prince
sitting
on
top
of
a
wall
with
his
feet
dangling
and
i
heard
him
say
then
you
dont
remember
this
is
not
the
exact
spot
another
voice
must
have
answered
him
for
he
replied
to
it
yes
yes
it
is
the
right
day
but
this
is
not
the
place
i
continued
my
walk
toward
the
wall
at
no
time
did
i
see
or
hear
anyone
the
little
prince
however
replied
once
again
exactly
you
will
see
where
my
track
begins
in
the
sand
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
wait
for
me
there
i
shall
be
there
tonight
i
was
only
twenty
metres
from
the
wall
and
i
still
saw
nothing
after
a
silence
the
little
prince
spoke
again
you
have
good
poison
you
are
sure
that
it
will
not
make
me
suffer
too
long
i
stopped
in
my
tracks
my
heart
torn
asunder
but
still
i
did
not
understand
now
go
away
said
the
little
prince
i
want
to
get
down
from
the
wall
i
dropped
my
eyes
then
to
the
foot
of
the
wall
and
i
leaped
into
the
air
there
before
me
facing
the
little
prince
was
one
of
those
yellow
snakes
that
take
just
thirty
seconds
to
bring
your
life
to
an
end
even
as
i
was
digging
into
my
pocked
to
get
out
my
revolver
i
made
a
running
step
back
but
at
the
noise
i
made
the
snake
let
himself
flow
easily
across
the
sand
like
the
dying
spray
of
a
fountain
and
in
no
apparent
hurry
disappeared
with
a
light
metallic
sound
among
the
stones
i
reached
the
wall
just
in
time
to
catch
my
little
man
in
my
arms
his
face
was
white
as
snow
what
does
this
mean
i
demanded
why
are
you
talking
with
snakes
i
had
loosened
the
golden
muffler
that
he
always
wore
i
had
moistened
his
temples
and
had
given
him
some
water
to
drink
and
now
i
did
not
dare
ask
him
any
more
questions
he
looked
at
me
very
gravely
and
put
his
arms
around
my
neck
i
felt
his
heart
beating
like
the
heart
of
a
dying
bird
shot
with
someones
rifle
i
am
glad
that
you
have
found
what
was
the
matter
with
your
engine
he
said
now
you
can
go
back
home
how
do
you
know
about
that
i
was
just
coming
to
tell
him
that
my
work
had
been
successful
beyond
anything
that
i
had
dared
to
hope
he
made
no
answer
to
my
question
but
he
added
i
too
am
going
back
home
today
then
sadly
it
is
much
farther
it
is
much
more
difficult
i
realised
clearly
that
something
extraordinary
was
happening
i
was
holding
him
close
in
my
arms
as
if
he
were
a
little
child
and
yet
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
rushing
headlong
toward
an
abyss
from
which
i
could
do
nothing
to
restrain
him
his
look
was
very
serious
like
some
one
lost
far
away
i
have
your
sheep
and
i
have
the
sheeps
box
and
i
have
the
muzzle
and
he
gave
me
a
sad
smile
i
waited
a
long
time
i
could
see
that
he
was
reviving
little
by
little
dear
little
man
i
said
to
him
you
are
afraid
he
was
afraid
there
was
no
doubt
about
that
but
he
laughed
lightly
i
shall
be
much
more
afraid
this
evening
once
again
i
felt
myself
frozen
by
the
sense
of
something
irreparable
and
i
knew
that
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
never
hearing
that
laughter
any
more
for
me
it
was
like
a
spring
of
fresh
water
in
the
desert
little
man
i
said
i
want
to
hear
you
laugh
again
but
he
said
to
me
tonight
it
will
be
a
year
my
star
then
can
be
found
right
above
the
place
where
i
came
to
the
earth
a
year
ago
little
man
i
said
tell
me
that
it
is
only
a
bad
dream
this
affair
of
the
snake
and
the
meeting
place
and
the
star
but
he
did
not
answer
my
plea
he
said
to
me
instead
the
thing
that
is
important
is
the
thing
that
is
not
seen
yes
i
know
it
is
just
as
it
is
with
the
flower
if
you
love
a
flower
that
lives
on
a
star
it
is
sweet
to
look
at
the
sky
at
night
all
the
stars
are
abloom
with
flowers
yes
i
know
it
is
just
as
it
is
with
the
water
because
of
the
pulley
and
the
rope
what
you
gave
me
to
drink
was
like
music
you
remember
how
good
it
was
yes
i
know
and
at
night
you
will
look
up
at
the
stars
where
i
live
everything
is
so
small
that
i
cannot
show
you
where
my
star
is
to
be
found
it
is
better
like
that
my
star
will
just
be
one
of
the
stars
for
you
and
so
you
will
love
to
watch
all
the
stars
in
the
heavens
they
will
all
be
your
friends
and
besides
i
am
going
to
make
you
a
present
he
laughed
again
ah
little
prince
dear
little
prince
i
love
to
hear
that
laughter
that
is
my
present
just
that
it
will
be
as
it
was
when
we
drank
the
water
what
are
you
trying
to
say
all
men
have
the
stars
he
answered
but
they
are
not
the
same
things
for
different
people
for
some
who
are
travellers
the
stars
are
guides
for
others
they
are
no
more
than
little
lights
in
the
sky
for
others
who
are
scholars
they
are
problems
for
my
businessman
they
were
wealth
but
all
these
stars
are
silent
you
you
alone
will
have
the
stars
as
no
one
else
has
them
what
are
you
trying
to
say
in
one
of
the
stars
i
shall
be
living
in
one
of
them
i
shall
be
laughing
and
so
it
will
be
as
if
all
the
stars
were
laughing
when
you
look
at
the
sky
at
night
you
only
you
will
have
stars
that
can
laugh
and
he
laughed
again
and
when
your
sorrow
is
comforted
time
soothes
all
sorrows
you
will
be
content
that
you
have
known
me
you
will
always
be
my
friend
you
will
want
to
laugh
with
me
and
you
will
sometimes
open
your
window
so
for
that
pleasure
and
your
friends
will
be
properly
astonished
to
see
you
laughing
as
you
look
up
at
the
sky
then
you
will
say
to
them
yes
the
stars
always
make
me
laugh
and
they
will
think
you
are
crazy
it
will
be
a
very
shabby
trick
that
i
shall
have
played
on
you
and
he
laughed
again
it
will
be
as
if
in
place
of
the
stars
i
had
given
you
a
great
number
of
little
bells
that
knew
how
to
laugh
and
he
laughed
again
then
he
quickly
became
serious
tonight
you
know
do
not
come
said
the
little
prince
i
shall
not
leave
you
i
said
i
shall
look
as
if
i
were
suffering
i
shall
look
a
little
as
if
i
were
dying
it
is
like
that
do
not
come
to
see
that
it
is
not
worth
the
trouble
i
shall
not
leave
you
but
he
was
worried
i
tell
you
it
is
also
because
of
the
snake
he
must
not
bite
you
snakes
they
are
malicious
creatures
this
one
might
bite
you
just
for
fun
i
shall
not
leave
you
but
a
thought
came
to
reassure
him
it
is
true
that
they
have
no
more
poison
for
a
second
bite
that
night
i
did
not
see
him
set
out
on
his
way
he
got
away
from
me
without
making
a
sound
when
i
succeeded
in
catching
up
with
him
he
was
walking
along
with
a
quick
and
resolute
step
he
said
to
me
merely
ah
you
are
there
and
he
took
me
by
the
hand
but
he
was
still
worrying
it
was
wrong
of
you
to
come
you
will
suffer
i
shall
look
as
if
i
were
dead
and
that
will
not
be
true
i
said
nothing
you
understand
it
is
too
far
i
cannot
carry
this
body
with
me
it
is
too
heavy
i
said
nothing
but
it
will
be
like
an
old
abandoned
shell
there
is
nothing
sad
about
old
shells
i
said
nothing
he
was
a
little
discouraged
but
he
made
one
more
effort
you
know
it
will
be
very
nice
i
too
shall
look
at
the
stars
all
the
stars
will
be
wells
with
a
rusty
pulley
all
the
stars
will
pour
out
fresh
water
for
me
to
drink
i
said
nothing
that
will
be
so
amusing
you
will
have
five
hundred
million
little
bells
and
i
shall
have
five
hundred
million
springs
of
fresh
water
and
he
too
said
nothing
more
because
he
was
crying
here
it
is
let
me
go
on
by
myself
and
he
sat
down
because
he
was
afraid
then
he
said
again
you
know
my
flower
i
am
responsible
for
her
and
she
is
so
weak
she
has
four
thorns
of
no
use
at
all
to
protect
herself
against
all
the
world
i
too
sat
down
because
i
was
not
able
to
stand
up
any
longer
there
now
that
is
all
he
still
hesitated
a
little
then
he
got
up
he
took
one
step
i
could
not
move
there
was
nothing
but
a
flash
of
yellow
close
to
his
ankle
he
remained
motionless
for
an
instant
he
did
not
cry
out
he
fell
as
gently
as
a
tree
falls
there
was
not
even
any
sound
because
of
the
sand
and
now
six
years
have
already
gone
by
i
have
never
yet
told
this
story
the
companions
who
met
me
on
my
return
were
well
content
to
see
me
alive
i
was
sad
but
i
told
them
i
am
tired
now
my
sorrow
is
comforted
a
little
that
is
to
say
not
entirely
but
i
know
that
he
did
go
back
to
his
planet
because
i
did
not
find
his
body
at
daybreak
it
was
not
such
a
heavy
body
and
at
night
i
love
to
listen
to
the
stars
it
is
like
five
hundred
million
little
bells
but
there
is
one
extraordinary
thing
when
i
drew
the
muzzle
for
the
little
prince
i
forgot
to
add
the
leather
strap
to
it
he
will
never
have
been
able
to
fasten
it
on
his
sheep
so
now
i
keep
wondering
what
is
happening
on
his
planet
perhaps
the
sheep
has
eaten
the
flower
at
one
time
i
say
to
myself
surely
not
the
little
prince
shuts
his
flower
under
her
glass
globe
every
night
and
he
watches
over
his
sheep
very
carefully
then
i
am
happy
and
there
is
sweetness
in
the
laughter
of
all
the
stars
but
at
another
time
i
say
to
myself
at
some
moment
or
other
one
is
absentminded
and
that
is
enough
on
some
one
evening
he
forgot
the
glass
globe
or
the
sheep
got
out
without
making
any
noise
in
the
night
and
then
the
little
bells
are
changed
to
tears
here
then
is
a
great
mystery
for
you
who
also
love
the
little
prince
and
for
me
nothing
in
the
universe
can
be
the
same
if
somewhere
we
do
not
know
where
a
sheep
that
we
never
saw
has
eaten
a
rose
look
up
at
the
sky
ask
yourselves
is
it
yes
or
no
has
the
sheep
eaten
the
flower
and
you
will
see
how
everything
changes
and
no
grownup
will
ever
understand
that
this
is
a
matter
of
so
much
importance
this
is
to
me
the
loveliest
and
saddest
landscape
in
the
world
it
is
the
same
as
that
on
the
preceding
page
but
i
have
drawn
it
again
to
impress
it
on
your
memory
it
is
here
that
the
little
prince
appeared
on
earth
and
disappeared
look
at
it
carefully
so
that
you
will
be
sure
to
recognise
it
in
case
you
travel
some
day
to
the
african
desert
and
if
you
should
come
upon
this
spot
please
do
not
hurry
on
wait
for
a
time
exactly
under
the
star
then
if
a
little
man
appears
who
laughs
who
has
golden
hair
and
who
refuses
to
answer
questions
you
will
know
who
he
is
if
this
should
happen
please
comfort
me
send
me
word
that
he
has
come
back
end
