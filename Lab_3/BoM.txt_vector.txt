nephi
chapter


i
nephi
having
been
born
of
goodly
parents
therefore
i
was
taught
somewhat
in
all
the
learning
of
my
father
and
having
seen
many
afflictions
in
the
course
of
my
days
nevertheless
having
been
highly
favored
of
the
lord
in
all
my
days
yea
having
had
a
great
knowledge
of
the
goodness
and
the
mysteries
of
god
therefore
i
make
a
record
of
my
proceedings
in
my
days

yea
i
make
a
record
in
the
language
of
my
father
which
consists
of
the
learning
of
the
jews
and
the
language
of
the
egyptians

and
i
know
that
the
record
which
i
make
is
true
and
i
make
it
with
mine
own
hand
and
i
make
it
according
to
my
knowledge

for
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
first
year
of
the
reign
of
zedekiah
king
of
judah
my
father
lehi
having
dwelt
at
jerusalem
in
all
his
days
and
in
that
same
year
there
came
many
prophets
prophesying
unto
the
people
that
they
must
repent
or
the
great
city
jerusalem
must
be
destroyed

wherefore
it
came
to
pass
that
my
father
lehi
as
he
went
forth
prayed
unto
the
lord
yea
even
with
all
his
heart
in
behalf
of
his
people

and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
prayed
unto
the
lord
there
came
a
pillar
of
fire
and
dwelt
upon
a
rock
before
him
and
he
saw
and
heard
much
and
because
of
the
things
which
he
saw
and
heard
he
did
quake
and
tremble
exceedingly

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
returned
to
his
own
house
at
jerusalem
and
he
cast
himself
upon
his
bed
being
overcome
with
the
spirit
and
the
things
which
he
had
seen

and
being
thus
overcome
with
the
spirit
he
was
carried
away
in
a
vision
even
that
he
saw
the
heavens
open
and
he
thought
he
saw
god
sitting
upon
his
throne
surrounded
with
numberless
concourses
of
angels
in
the
attitude
of
singing
and
praising
their
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
saw
one
descending
out
of
the
midst
of
heaven
and
he
beheld
that
his
luster
was
above
that
of
the
sun
at
noonday

and
he
also
saw
twelve
others
following
him
and
their
brightness
did
exceed
that
of
the
stars
in
the
firmament

and
they
came
down
and
went
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
the
first
came
and
stood
before
my
father
and
gave
unto
him
a
book
and
bade
him
that
he
should
read

and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
he
read
he
was
filled
with
the
spirit
of
the
lord

and
he
read
saying
wo
wo
unto
jerusalem
for
i
have
seen
thine
abominations
yea
and
many
things
did
my
father
read
concerning
jerusalemthat
it
should
be
destroyed
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
many
should
perish
by
the
sword
and
many
should
be
carried
away
captive
into
babylon

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
my
father
had
read
and
seen
many
great
and
marvelous
things
he
did
exclaim
many
things
unto
the
lord
such
as
great
and
marvelous
are
thy
works
o
lord
god
almighty
thy
throne
is
high
in
the
heavens
and
thy
power
and
goodness
and
mercy
are
over
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
and
because
thou
art
merciful
thou
wilt
not
suffer
those
who
come
unto
thee
that
they
shall
perish

and
after
this
manner
was
the
language
of
my
father
in
the
praising
of
his
god
for
his
soul
did
rejoice
and
his
whole
heart
was
filled
because
of
the
things
which
he
had
seen
yea
which
the
lord
had
shown
unto
him

and
now
i
nephi
do
not
make
a
full
account
of
the
things
which
my
father
hath
written
for
he
hath
written
many
things
which
he
saw
in
visions
and
in
dreams
and
he
also
hath
written
many
things
which
he
prophesied
and
spake
unto
his
children
of
which
i
shall
not
make
a
full
account

but
i
shall
make
an
account
of
my
proceedings
in
my
days
behold
i
make
an
abridgment
of
the
record
of
my
father
upon
plates
which
i
have
made
with
mine
own
hands
wherefore
after
i
have
abridged
the
record
of
my
father
then
will
i
make
an
account
of
mine
own
life

therefore
i
would
that
ye
should
know
that
after
the
lord
had
shown
so
many
marvelous
things
unto
my
father
lehi
yea
concerning
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
behold
he
went
forth
among
the
people
and
began
to
prophesy
and
to
declare
unto
them
concerning
the
things
which
he
had
both
seen
and
heard

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
jews
did
mock
him
because
of
the
things
which
he
testified
of
them
for
he
truly
testified
of
their
wickedness
and
their
abominations
and
he
testified
that
the
things
which
he
saw
and
heard
and
also
the
things
which
he
read
in
the
book
manifested
plainly
of
the
coming
of
the
messiah
and
also
the
redemption
of
the
world

and
when
the
jews
heard
these
things
they
were
angry
with
him
yea
even
as
with
the
prophets
of
old
whom
they
had
cast
out
and
stoned
and
slain
and
they
also
sought
his
life
that
they
might
take
it
away
but
behold
i
nephi
will
show
unto
you
that
the
tender
mercies
of
the
lord
are
over
all
those
whom
he
hath
chosen
because
of
their
faith
to
make
them
mighty
even
unto
the
power
of
deliverance

nephi
chapter


for
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
spake
unto
my
father
yea
even
in
a
dream
and
said
unto
him
blessed
art
thou
lehi
because
of
the
things
which
thou
hast
done
and
because
thou
hast
been
faithful
and
declared
unto
this
people
the
things
which
i
commanded
thee
behold
they
seek
to
take
away
thy
life

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
commanded
my
father
even
in
a
dream
that
he
should
take
his
family
and
depart
into
the
wilderness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
was
obedient
unto
the
word
of
the
lord
wherefore
he
did
as
the
lord
commanded
him

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
departed
into
the
wilderness
and
he
left
his
house
and
the
land
of
his
inheritance
and
his
gold
and
his
silver
and
his
precious
things
and
took
nothing
with
him
save
it
were
his
family
and
provisions
and
tents
and
departed
into
the
wilderness

and
he
came
down
by
the
borders
near
the
shore
of
the
red
sea
and
he
traveled
in
the
wilderness
in
the
borders
which
are
nearer
the
red
sea
and
he
did
travel
in
the
wilderness
with
his
family
which
consisted
of
my
mother
sariah
and
my
elder
brothers
who
were
laman
lemuel
and
sam

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
traveled
three
days
in
the
wilderness
he
pitched
his
tent
in
a
valley
by
the
side
of
a
river
of
water

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
built
an
altar
of
stones
and
made
an
offering
unto
the
lord
and
gave
thanks
unto
the
lord
our
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
called
the
name
of
the
river
laman
and
it
emptied
into
the
red
sea
and
the
valley
was
in
the
borders
near
the
mouth
thereof

and
when
my
father
saw
that
the
waters
of
the
river
emptied
into
the
fountain
of
the
red
sea
he
spake
unto
laman
saying
o
that
thou
mightest
be
like
unto
this
river
continually
running
into
the
fountain
of
all
righteousness

and
he
also
spake
unto
lemuel
o
that
thou
mightest
be
like
unto
this
valley
firm
and
steadfast
and
immovable
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
the
lord

now
this
he
spake
because
of
the
stiffneckedness
of
laman
and
lemuel
for
behold
they
did
murmur
in
many
things
against
their
father
because
he
was
a
visionary
man
and
had
led
them
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
to
leave
the
land
of
their
inheritance
and
their
gold
and
their
silver
and
their
precious
things
to
perish
in
the
wilderness
and
this
they
said
he
had
done
because
of
the
foolish
imaginations
of
his
heart

and
thus
laman
and
lemuel
being
the
eldest
did
murmur
against
their
father
and
they
did
murmur
because
they
knew
not
the
dealings
of
that
god
who
had
created
them

neither
did
they
believe
that
jerusalem
that
great
city
could
be
destroyed
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophets
and
they
were
like
unto
the
jews
who
were
at
jerusalem
who
sought
to
take
away
the
life
of
my
father

and
it
came
to
pass
that
my
father
did
speak
unto
them
in
the
valley
of
lemuel
with
power
being
filled
with
the
spirit
until
their
frames
did
shake
before
him
and
he
did
confound
them
that
they
durst
not
utter
against
him
wherefore
they
did
as
he
commanded
them

and
my
father
dwelt
in
a
tent

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
being
exceedingly
young
nevertheless
being
large
in
stature
and
also
having
great
desires
to
know
of
the
mysteries
of
god
wherefore
i
did
cry
unto
the
lord
and
behold
he
did
visit
me
and
did
soften
my
heart
that
i
did
believe
all
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
by
my
father
wherefore
i
did
not
rebel
against
him
like
unto
my
brothers

and
i
spake
unto
sam
making
known
unto
him
the
things
which
the
lord
had
manifested
unto
me
by
his
holy
spirit
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
believed
in
my
words

but
behold
laman
and
lemuel
would
not
hearken
unto
my
words
and
being
grieved
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
i
cried
unto
the
lord
for
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
spake
unto
me
saying
blessed
art
thou
nephi
because
of
thy
faith
for
thou
hast
sought
me
diligently
with
lowliness
of
heart

and
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
ye
shall
prosper
and
shall
be
led
to
a
land
of
promise
yea
even
a
land
which
i
have
prepared
for
you
yea
a
land
which
is
choice
above
all
other
lands

and
inasmuch
as
thy
brethren
shall
rebel

shall
be

off

and
inasmuch
as
thou
shalt
keep
my
commandments
thou
shalt
be

behold
in

if
it
so

that

they
shall
be

up
in
the
ways
of

nephi
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
returned
from
speaking
with
the
lord
to
the
tent
of
my
father

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
spake
unto
me
saying
behold
i
have
dreamed
a
dream
in
the
which
the
lord
hath
commanded
me
that
thou
and
thy
brethren
shall
return
to
jerusalem

for
behold
laban
hath
the
record
of
the
jews
and
also
a
genealogy
of
my
forefathers
and
they
are
engraven
upon
plates
of
brass

wherefore
the
lord
hath
commanded
me
that
thou
and
thy
brothers
should
go
unto
the
house
of
laban
and
seek
the
records
and
bring
them
down
hither
into
the
wilderness

and
now
behold
thy
brothers
murmur
saying
it
is
a
hard
thing
which
i
have
required
of
them
but
behold
i
have
not
required
it
of
them
but
it
is
a
commandment
of
the
lord

therefore
go
my
son
and
thou
shalt
be
favored
of
the
lord
because
thou
hast
not
murmured

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
said
unto
my
father
i
will
go
and
do
the
things
which
the
lord
hath
commanded
for
i
know
that
the
lord
giveth
no
commandments
unto
the
children
of
men
save
he
shall
prepare
a
way
for
them
that
they
may
accomplish
the
thing
which
he
commandeth
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
my
father
had
heard
these
words
he
was
exceedingly
glad
for
he
knew
that
i
had
been
blessed
of
the
lord

and
i
nephi
and
my
brethren
took
our
journey
in
the
wilderness
with
our
tents
to
go
up
to
the
land
of
jerusalem

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
we
had
gone
up
to
the
land
of
jerusalem
i
and
my
brethren
did
consult
one
with
another

and
we
cast
lotswho
of
us
should
go
in
unto
the
house
of
laban
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lot
fell
upon
laman
and
laman
went
in
unto
the
house
of
laban
and
he
talked
with
him
as
he
sat
in
his
house

and
he
desired
of
laban
the
records
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
which
contained
the
genealogy
of
my
father

and
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
laban
was
angry
and
thrust
him
out
from
his
presence
and
he
would
not
that
he
should
have
the
records
wherefore
he
said
unto
him
behold
thou
art
a
robber
and
i
will
slay
thee

but
laman
fled
out
of
his
presence
and
told
the
things
which
laban
had
done
unto
us
and
we
began
to
be
exceedingly
sorrowful
and
my
brethren
were
about
to
return
unto
my
father
in
the
wilderness

but
behold
i
said
unto
them
that
as
the
lord
liveth
and
as
we
live
we
will
not
go
down
unto
our
father
in
the
wilderness
until
we
have
accomplished
the
thing
which
the
lord
hath
commanded
us

wherefore
let
us
be
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
the
lord
therefore
let
us
go
down
to
the
land
of
our
fathers
inheritance
for
behold
he
left
gold
and
silver
and
all
manner
of
riches
and
all
this
he
hath
done
because
of
the
commandments
of
the
lord

for
he
knew
that
jerusalem
must
be
destroyed
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
people

for
behold
they
have
rejected
the
words
of
the
prophets
wherefore
if
my
father
should
dwell
in
the
land
after
he
hath
been
commanded
to
flee
out
of
the
land
behold
he
would
also
perish
wherefore
it
must
needs
be
that
he
flee
out
of
the
land

and
behold
it
is
wisdom
in
god
that
we
should
obtain
these
records
that
we
may
preserve
unto
our
children
the
language
of
our
fathers

and
also
that
we
may
preserve
unto
them
the
words
which
have
been
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
all
the
holy
prophets
which
have
been
delivered
unto
them
by
the
spirit
and
power
of
god
since
the
world
began
even
down
unto
this
present
time

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
this
manner
of
language
did
i
persuade
my
brethren
that
they
might
be
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
went
down
to
the
land
of
our
inheritance
and
we
did
gather
together
our
gold
and
our
silver
and
our
precious
things

and
after
we
had
gathered
these
things
together
we
went
up
again
unto
the
house
of
laban

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
went
in
unto
laban
and
desired
him
that
he
would
give
unto
us
the
records
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
for
which
we
would
give
unto
him
our
gold
and
our
silver
and
all
our
precious
things

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
laban
saw
our
property
and
that
it
was
exceedingly
great
he
did
lust
after
it
insomuch
that
he
thrust
us
out
and
sent
his
servants
to
slay
us
that
he
might
obtain
our
property

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
flee
before
the
servants
of
laban
and
we
were
obliged
to
leave
behind
our
property
and
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
laban

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
fled
into
the
wilderness
and
the
servants
of
laban
did
not
overtake
us
and
we
hid
ourselves
in
the
cavity
of
a
rock

and
it
came
to
pass
that
laman
was
angry
with
me
and
also
with
my
father
and
also
was
lemuel
for
he
hearkened
unto
the
words
of
laman
wherefore
laman
and
lemuel
did
speak
many
hard
words
unto
us
their
younger
brothers
and
they
did
smite
us
even
with
a
rod

and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
smote
us
with
a
rod
behold
an
angel
of
the
lord
came
and
stood
before
them
and
he
spake
unto
them
saying
why
do
ye
smite
your
younger
brother
with
a
rod
know
ye
not
that
the
lord
hath
chosen
him
to
be
a
ruler
over
you
and
this
because
of
your
iniquities
behold
ye
shall
go
up
to
jerusalem
again
and
the
lord
will
deliver
laban
into
your
hands

and
after
the
angel
had
spoken
unto
us
he
departed

and
after
the
angel
had
departed
laman
and
lemuel
again
began
to
murmur
saying
how
is
it
possible
that
the
lord
will
deliver
laban
into
our
hands
behold
he
is
a
mighty
man
and
he
can
command
fifty
yea
even
he
can
slay
fifty
then
why
not
us

nephi
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
spake
unto
my
brethren
saying
let
us
go
up
again
unto
jerusalem
and
let
us
be
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
the
lord
for
behold
he
is
mightier
than
all
the
earth
then
why
not
mightier
than
laban
and
his
fifty
yea
or
even
than
his
tens
of
thousands

therefore
let
us
go
up
let
us
be
strong
like
unto
moses
for
he
truly
spake
unto
the
waters
of
the
red
sea
and
they
divided
hither
and
thither
and
our
fathers
came
through
out
of
captivity
on
dry
ground
and
the
armies
of
pharaoh
did
follow
and
were
drowned
in
the
waters
of
the
red
sea

now
behold
ye
know
that
this
is
true
and
ye
also
know
that
an
angel
hath
spoken
unto
you
wherefore
can
ye
doubt
let
us
go
up
the
lord
is
able
to
deliver
us
even
as
our
fathers
and
to
destroy
laban
even
as
the
egyptians

now
when
i
had
spoken
these
words
they
were
yet
wroth
and
did
still
continue
to
murmur
nevertheless
they
did
follow
me
up
until
we
came
without
the
walls
of
jerusalem

and
it
was
by
night
and
i
caused
that
they
should
hide
themselves
without
the
walls
and
after
they
had
hid
themselves
i
nephi
crept
into
the
city
and
went
forth
towards
the
house
of
laban

and
i
was
led
by
the
spirit
not
knowing
beforehand
the
things
which
i
should
do

nevertheless
i
went
forth
and
as
i
came
near
unto
the
house
of
laban
i
beheld
a
man
and
he
had
fallen
to
the
earth
before
me
for
he
was
drunken
with
wine

and
when
i
came
to
him
i
found
that
it
was
laban

and
i
beheld
his
sword
and
i
drew
it
forth
from
the
sheath
thereof
and
the
hilt
thereof
was
of
pure
gold
and
the
workmanship
thereof
was
exceedingly
fine
and
i
saw
that
the
blade
thereof
was
of
the
most
precious
steel

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
was
constrained
by
the
spirit
that
i
should
kill
laban
but
i
said
in
my
heart
never
at
any
time
have
i
shed
the
blood
of
man
and
i
shrunk
and
would
that
i
might
not
slay
him

and
the
spirit
said
unto
me
again
behold
the
lord
hath
delivered
him
into
thy
hands
yea
and
i
also
knew
that
he
had
sought
to
take
away
mine
own
life
yea
and
he
would
not
hearken
unto
the
commandments
of
the
lord
and
he
also
had
taken
away
our
property

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
spirit
said
unto
me
again
slay
him
for
the
lord
hath
delivered
him
into
thy
hands

behold
the
lord
slayeth
the
wicked
to
bring
forth
his
righteous
purposes
it
is
better
that
one
man
should
perish
than
that
a
nation
should
dwindle
and
perish
in
unbelief

and
now
when
i
nephi
had
heard
these
words
i
remembered
the
words
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
unto
me
in
the
wilderness
saying
that
inasmuch
as
thy
seed
shall
keep
my
commandments
they
shall
prosper
in
the
land
of
promise

yea
and
i
also
thought
that
they
could
not
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
according
to
the
law
of
moses
save
they
should
have
the
law

and
i
also
knew
that
the
law
was
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass

and
again
i
knew
that
the
lord
had
delivered
laban
into
my
hands
for
this
causethat
i
might
obtain
the
records
according
to
his
commandments

therefore
i
did
obey
the
voice
of
the
spirit
and
took
laban
by
the
hair
of
the
head
and
i
smote
off
his
head
with
his
own
sword

and
after
i
had
smitten
off
his
head
with
his
own
sword
i
took
the
garments
of
laban
and
put
them
upon
mine
own
body
yea
even
every
whit
and
i
did
gird
on
his
armor
about
my
loins

and
after
i
had
done
this
i
went
forth
unto
the
treasury
of
laban
and
as
i
went
forth
towards
the
treasury
of
laban
behold
i
saw
the
servant
of
laban
who
had
the
keys
of
the
treasury
and
i
commanded
him
in
the
voice
of
laban
that
he
should
go
with
me
into
the
treasury

and
he
supposed
me
to
be
his
master
laban
for
he
beheld
the
garments
and
also
the
sword
girded
about
my
loins

and
he
spake
unto
me
concerning
the
elders
of
the
jews
he
knowing
that
his
master
laban
had
been
out
by
night
among
them

and
i
spake
unto
him
as
if
it
had
been
laban

and
i
also
spake
unto
him
that
i
should
carry
the
engravings
which
were
upon
the
plates
of
brass
to
my
elder
brethren
who
were
without
the
walls

and
i
also
bade
him
that
he
should
follow
me

and
he
supposing
that
i
spake
of
the
brethren
of
the
church
and
that
i
was
truly
that
laban
whom
i
had
slain
wherefore
he
did
follow
me

and
he
spake
unto
me
many
times
concerning
the
elders
of
the
jews
as
i
went
forth
unto
my
brethren
who
were
without
the
walls

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
laman
saw
me
he
was
exceedingly
frightened
and
also
lemuel
and
sam
and
they
fled
from
before
my
presence
for
they
supposed
it
was
laban
and
that
he
had
slain
me
and
had
sought
to
take
away
their
lives
also

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
called
after
them
and
they
did
hear
me
wherefore
they
did
cease
to
flee
from
my
presence

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
servant
of
laban
beheld
my
brethren
he
began
to
tremble
and
was
about
to
flee
from
before
me
and
return
to
the
city
of
jerusalem

and
now
i
nephi
being
a
man
large
in
stature
and
also
having
received
much
strength
of
the
lord
therefore
i
did
seize
upon
the
servant
of
laban
and
held
him
that
he
should
not
flee

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
spake
with
him
that
if
he
would
hearken
unto
my
words
as
the
lord
liveth
and
as
i
live
even
so
that
if
he
would
hearken
unto
our
words
we
would
spare
his
life

and
i
spake
unto
him
even
with
an
oath
that
he
need
not
fear
that
he
should
be
a
free
man
like
unto
us
if
he
would
go
down
in
the
wilderness
with
us

and
i
also
spake
unto
him
saying
surely
the
lord
hath
commanded
us
to
do
this
thing
and
shall
we
not
be
diligent
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
the
lord
therefore
if
thou
wilt
go
down
into
the
wilderness
to
my
father
thou
shalt
have
place
with
us

and
it
came
to
pass
that
zoram
did
take
courage
at
the
words
which
i
spake
now
zoram
was
the
name
of
the
servant
and
he
promised
that
he
would
go
down
into
the
wilderness
unto
our
father
yea
and
he
also
made
an
oath
unto
us
that
he
would
tarry
with
us
from
that
time
forth

now
we
were
desirous
that
he
should
tarry
with
us
for
this
cause
that
the
jews
might
not
know
concerning
our
flight
into
the
wilderness
lest
they
should
pursue
us
and
destroy
us

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
zoram
had
made
an
oath
unto
us
our
fears
did
cease
concerning
him

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
took
the
plates
of
brass
and
the
servant
of
laban
and
departed
into
the
wilderness
and
journeyed
unto
the
tent
of
our
father

chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
we
had
come
down
into
the
wilderness
unto
our
father
behold
he
was
filled
with
joy
and
also
my
mother
sariah
was
exceedingly
glad
for
she
truly
had
mourned
because
of
us

for
she
had
supposed
that
we
had
perished
in
the
wilderness
and
she
also
had
complained
against
my
father
telling
him
that
he
was
a
visionary
man
saying
behold
thou
hast
led
us
forth
from
the
land
of
our
inheritance
and
my
sons
are
no
more
and
we
perish
in
the
wilderness

and
after
this
manner
of
language
had
my
mother
complained
against
my
father

and
it
had
come
to
pass
that
my
father
spake
unto
her
saying
i
know
that
i
am
a
visionary
man
for
if
i
had
not
seen
the
things
of
god
in
a
vision
i
should
not
have
known
the
goodness
of
god
but
had
tarried
at
jerusalem
and
had
perished
with
my
brethren

but
behold
i
have
obtained
a
land
of
promise
in
the
which
things
i
do
rejoice
yea
and
i
know
that
the
lord
will
deliver
my
sons
out
of
the
hands
of
laban
and
bring
them
down
again
unto
us
in
the
wilderness

and
after
this
manner
of
language
did
my
father
lehi
comfort
my
mother
sariah
concerning
us
while
we
journeyed
in
the
wilderness
up
to
the
land
of
jerusalem
to
obtain
the
record
of
the
jews

and
when
we
had
returned
to
the
tent
of
my
father
behold
their
joy
was
full
and
my
mother
was
comforted

and
she
spake
saying
now
i
know
of
a
surety
that
the
lord
hath
commanded
my
husband
to
flee
into
the
wilderness
yea
and
i
also
know
of
a
surety
that
the
lord
hath
protected
my
sons
and
delivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
laban
and
given
them
power
whereby
they
could
accomplish
the
thing
which
the
lord
hath
commanded
them
and
after
this
manner
of
language
did
she
speak

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
rejoice
exceedingly
and
did
offer
sacrifice
and
burnt
offerings
unto
the
lord
and
they
gave
thanks
unto
the
god
of
israel

and
after
they
had
given
thanks
unto
the
god
of
israel
my
father
lehi
took
the
records
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
and
he
did
search
them
from
the
beginning

and
he
beheld
that
they
did
contain
the
five
books
of
moses
which
gave
an
account
of
the
creation
of
the
world
and
also
of
adam
and
eve
who
were
our
first
parents

and
also
a
record
of
the
jews
from
the
beginning
even
down
to
the
commencement
of
the
reign
of
zedekiah
king
of
judah

and
also
the
prophecies
of
the
holy
prophets
from
the
beginning
even
down
to
the
commencement
of
the
reign
of
zedekiah
and
also
many
prophecies
which
have
been
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
jeremiah

and
it
came
to
pass
that
my
father
lehi
also
found
upon
the
plates
of
brass
a
genealogy
of
his
fathers
wherefore
he
knew
that
he
was
a
descendant
of
joseph
yea
even
that
joseph
who
was
the
son
of
jacob
who
was
sold
into
egypt
and
who
was
preserved
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
that
he
might
preserve
his
father
jacob
and
all
his
household
from
perishing
with
famine

and
they
were
also
led
out
of
captivity
and
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
by
that
same
god
who
had
preserved
them

and
thus
my
father
lehi
did
discover
the
genealogy
of
his
fathers
and
laban
also
was
a
descendant
of
joseph
wherefore
he
and
his
fathers
had
kept
the
records

and
now
when
my
father
saw
all
these
things
he
was
filled
with
the
spirit
and
began
to
prophesy
concerning
his
seed

that
these
plates
of
brass
should
go
forth
unto
all
nations
kindreds
tongues
and
people
who
were
of
his
seed

wherefore
he
said
that
these
plates
of
brass
should
never
perish
neither
should
they
be
dimmed
any
more
by
time
and
he
prophesied
many
things
concerning
his
seed

and
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
far
i
and
my
father
had
kept
the
commandments
wherewith
the
lord
had
commanded
us

and
we
had
obtained
the
records
which
the
lord
had
commanded
us
and
searched
them
and
found
that
they
were
desirable
yea
even
of
great
worth
unto
us
insomuch
that
we
could
preserve
the
commandments
of
the
lord
unto
our
children

wherefore
it
was
wisdom
in
the
lord
that
we
should
carry
them
with
us
as
we
journeyed
in
the
wilderness
towards
the
land
of
promise

nephi
chapter


and
now
i
nephi
do
not
give
the
genealogy
of
my
fathers
in
this
part
of
my
record
neither
at
any
time
shall
i
give
it
after
upon
these
plates
which
i
am
writing
for
it
is
given
in
the
record
which
has
been
kept
by
my
father
wherefore
i
do
not
write
it
in
this
work

for
it
sufficeth
me
to
say
that
we
are
descendants
of
joseph

and
it
mattereth
not
to
me
that
i
am
particular
to
give
a
full
account
of
all
the
things
of
my
father
for
they
cannot
be
written
upon
these
plates
for
i
desire
the
room
that
i
may
write
of
the
things
of
god

for
the
fulness
of
mine
intent
is
that
i
may
persuade
men
to
come
unto
the
god
of
abraham
and
the
god
of
isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
and
be
saved

wherefore
the
things
which
are
pleasing
unto
the
world
i
do
not
write
but
the
things
which
are
pleasing
unto
god
and
unto
those
who
are
not
of
the
world

wherefore
i
shall
give
commandment
unto
my
seed
that
they
shall
not
occupy
these
plates
with
things
which
are
not
of
worth
unto
the
children
of
men

nephi
chapter


and
now
i
would
that
ye
might
know
that
after
my
father
lehi
had
made
an
end
of
prophesying
concerning
his
seed
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
spake
unto
him
again
saying
that
it
was
not
meet
for
him
lehi
that
he
should
take
his
family
into
the
wilderness
alone
but
that
his
sons
should
take
daughters
to
wife
that
they
might
raise
up
seed
unto
the
lord
in
the
land
of
promise

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
commanded
him
that
i
nephi
and
my
brethren
should
again
return
unto
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
bring
down
ishmael
and
his
family
into
the
wilderness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
did
again
with
my
brethren
go
forth
into
the
wilderness
to
go
up
to
jerusalem

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
went
up
unto
the
house
of
ishmael
and
we
did
gain
favor
in
the
sight
of
ishmael
insomuch
that
we
did
speak
unto
him
the
words
of
the
lord

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
did
soften
the
heart
of
ishmael
and
also
his
household
insomuch
that
they
took
their
journey
with
us
down
into
the
wilderness
to
the
tent
of
our
father

and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
we
journeyed
in
the
wilderness
behold
laman
and
lemuel
and
two
of
the
daughters
of
ishmael
and
the
two
sons
of
ishmael
and
their
families
did
rebel
against
us
yea
against
me
nephi
and
sam
and
their
father
ishmael
and
his
wife
and
his
three
other
daughters

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
which
rebellion
they
were
desirous
to
return
unto
the
land
of
jerusalem

and
now
i
nephi
being
grieved
for
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
therefore
i
spake
unto
them
saying
yea
even
unto
laman
and
unto
lemuel
behold
ye
are
mine
elder
brethren
and
how
is
it
that
ye
are
so
hard
in
your
hearts
and
so
blind
in
your
minds
that
ye
have
need
that
i
your
younger
brother
should
speak
unto
you
yea
and
set
an
example
for
you

how
is
it
that
ye
have
not
hearkened
unto
the
word
of
the
lord

how
is
it
that
ye
have
forgotten
that
ye
have
seen
an
angel
of
the
lord

yea
and
how
is
it
that
ye
have
forgotten
what
great
things
the
lord
hath
done
for
us
in
delivering
us
out
of
the
hands
of
laban
and
also
that
we
should
obtain
the
record

yea
and
how
is
it
that
ye
have
forgotten
that
the
lord
is
able
to
do
all
things
according
to
his
will
for
the
children
of
men
if
it
so
be
that
they
exercise
faith
in
him
wherefore
let
us
be
faithful
to
him

and
if
it
so
be
that
we
are
faithful
to
him
we
shall
obtain
the
land
of
promise
and
ye
shall
know
at
some
future
period
that
the
word
of
the
lord
shall
be
fulfilled
concerning
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
for
all
things
which
the
lord
hath
spoken
concerning
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
must
be
fulfilled

for
behold
the
spirit
of
the
lord
ceaseth
soon
to
strive
with
them
for
behold
they
have
rejected
the
prophets
and
jeremiah
have
they
cast
into
prison
and
they
have
sought
to
take
away
the
life
of
my
father
insomuch
that
they
have
driven
him
out
of
the
land

now
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
if
ye
will
return
unto
jerusalem
ye
shall
also
perish
with
them
and
now
if
ye
have
choice
go
up
to
the
land
and
remember
the
words
which
i
speak
unto
you
that
if
ye
go
ye
will
also
perish
for
thus
the
spirit
of
the
lord
constraineth
me
that
i
should
speak

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
i
nephi
had
spoken
these
words
unto
my
brethren
they
were
angry
with
me
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
lay
their
hands
upon
me
for
behold
they
were
exceedingly
wroth
and
they
did
bind
me
with
cords
for
they
sought
to
take
away
my
life
that
they
might
leave
me
in
the
wilderness
to
be
devoured
by
wild
beasts

but
it
came
to
pass
that
i
prayed
unto
the
lord
saying
o
lord
according
to
my
faith
which
is
in
thee
wilt
thou
deliver
me
from
the
hands
of
my
brethren
yea
even
give
me
strength
that
i
may
burst
these
bands
with
which
i
am
bound

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
i
had
said
these
words
behold
the
bands
were
loosed
from
off
my
hands
and
feet
and
i
stood
before
my
brethren
and
i
spake
unto
them
again

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
angry
with
me
again
and
sought
to
lay
hands
upon
me
but
behold
one
of
the
daughters
of
ishmael
yea
and
also
her
mother
and
one
of
the
sons
of
ishmael
did
plead
with
my
brethren
insomuch
that
they
did
soften
their
hearts
and
they
did
cease
striving
to
take
away
my
life

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
sorrowful
because
of
their
wickedness
insomuch
that
they
did
bow
down
before
me
and
did
plead
with
me
that
i
would
forgive
them
of
the
thing
that
they
had
done
against
me

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
did
frankly
forgive
them
all
that
they
had
done
and
i
did
exhort
them
that
they
would
pray
unto
the
lord
their
god
for
forgiveness
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
so
and
after
they
had
done
praying
unto
the
lord
we
did
again
travel
on
our
journey
towards
the
tent
of
our
father

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
come
down
unto
the
tent
of
our
father
and
after
i
and
my
brethren
and
all
the
house
of
ishmael
had
come
down
unto
the
tent
of
my
father
they
did
give
thanks
unto
the
lord
their
god
and
they
did
offer
sacrifice
and
burnt
offerings
unto
him

nephi
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
had
gathered
together
all
manner
of
seeds
of
every
kind
both
of
grain
of
every
kind
and
also
of
the
seeds
of
fruit
of
every
kind

and
it
came
to
pass
that
while
my
father
tarried
in
the
wilderness
he
spake
unto
us
saying
behold
i
have
dreamed
a
dream
or
in
other
words
i
have
seen
a
vision

and
behold
because
of
the
thing
which
i
have
seen
i
have
reason
to
rejoice
in
the
lord
because
of
nephi
and
also
of
sam
for
i
have
reason
to
suppose
that
they
and
also
many
of
their
seed
will
be
saved

but
behold
laman
and
lemuel
i
fear
exceedingly
because
of
you
for
behold
methought
i
saw
in
my
dream
a
dark
and
dreary
wilderness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
saw
a
man
and
he
was
dressed
in
a
white
robe
and
he
came
and
stood
before
me

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
spake
unto
me
and
bade
me
follow
him

and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
i
followed
him
i
beheld
myself
that
i
was
in
a
dark
and
dreary
waste

and
after
i
had
traveled
for
the
space
of
many
hours
in
darkness
i
began
to
pray
unto
the
lord
that
he
would
have
mercy
on
me
according
to
the
multitude
of
his
tender
mercies

and
it
came
to
pass
after
i
had
prayed
unto
the
lord
i
beheld
a
large
and
spacious
field

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
beheld
a
tree
whose
fruit
was
desirable
to
make
one
happy

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
did
go
forth
and
partake
of
the
fruit
thereof
and
i
beheld
that
it
was
most
sweet
above
all
that
i
ever
before
tasted
yea
and
i
beheld
that
the
fruit
thereof
was
white
to
exceed
all
the
whiteness
that
i
had
ever
seen

and
as
i
partook
of
the
fruit
thereof
it
filled
my
soul
with
exceedingly
great
joy
wherefore
i
began
to
be
desirous
that
my
family
should
partake
of
it
also
for
i
knew
that
it
was
desirable
above
all
other
fruit

and
as
i
cast
my
eyes
round
about
that
perhaps
i
might
discover
my
family
also
i
beheld
a
river
of
water
and
it
ran
along
and
it
was
near
the
tree
of
which
i
was
partaking
the
fruit

and
i
looked
to
behold
from
whence
it
came
and
i
saw
the
head
thereof
a
little
way
off
and
at
the
head
thereof
i
beheld
your
mother
sariah
and
sam
and
nephi
and
they
stood
as
if
they
knew
not
whither
they
should
go

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
beckoned
unto
them
and
i
also
did
say
unto
them
with
a
loud
voice
that
they
should
come
unto
me
and
partake
of
the
fruit
which
was
desirable
above
all
other
fruit

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
come
unto
me
and
partake
of
the
fruit
also

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
was
desirous
that
laman
and
lemuel
should
come
and
partake
of
the
fruit
also
wherefore
i
cast
mine
eyes
towards
the
head
of
the
river
that
perhaps
i
might
see
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
saw
them
but
they
would
not
come
unto
me
and
partake
of
the
fruit

and
i
beheld
a
rod
of
iron
and
it
extended
along
the
bank
of
the
river
and
led
to
the
tree
by
which
i
stood

and
i
also
beheld
a
strait
and
narrow
path
which
came
along
by
the
rod
of
iron
even
to
the
tree
by
which
i
stood
and
it
also
led
by
the
head
of
the
fountain
unto
a
large
and
spacious
field
as
if
it
had
been
a
world

and
i
saw
numberless
concourses
of
people
many
of
whom
were
pressing
forward
that
they
might
obtain
the
path
which
led
unto
the
tree
by
which
i
stood

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
come
forth
and
commence
in
the
path
which
led
to
the
tree

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
arose
a
mist
of
darkness
yea
even
an
exceedingly
great
mist
of
darkness
insomuch
that
they
who
had
commenced
in
the
path
did
lose
their
way
that
they
wandered
off
and
were
lost

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
beheld
others
pressing
forward
and
they
came
forth
and
caught
hold
of
the
end
of
the
rod
of
iron
and
they
did
press
forward
through
the
mist
of
darkness
clinging
to
the
rod
of
iron
even
until
they
did
come
forth
and
partake
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree

and
after
they
had
partaken
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
they
did
cast
their
eyes
about
as
if
they
were
ashamed

and
i
also
cast
my
eyes
round
about
and
beheld
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
of
water
a
great
and
spacious
building
and
it
stood
as
it
were
in
the
air
high
above
the
earth

and
it
was
filled
with
people
both
old
and
young
both
male
and
female
and
their
manner
of
dress
was
exceedingly
fine
and
they
were
in
the
attitude
of
mocking
and
pointing
their
fingers
towards
those
who
had
come
at
and
were
partaking
of
the
fruit

and
after
they
had
tasted
of
the
fruit
they
were
ashamed
because
of
those
that
were
scoffing
at
them
and
they
fell
away
into
forbidden
paths
and
were
lost

and
now
i
nephi
do
not
speak
all
the
words
of
my
father

but
to
be
short
in
writing
behold
he
saw
other
multitudes
pressing
forward
and
they
came
and
caught
hold
of
the
end
of
the
rod
of
iron
and
they
did
press
their
way
forward
continually
holding
fast
to
the
rod
of
iron
until
they
came
forth
and
fell
down
and
partook
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree

and
he
also
saw
other
multitudes
feeling
their
way
towards
that
great
and
spacious
building

and
it
came
to
pass
that
many
were
drowned
in
the
depths
of
the
fountain
and
many
were
lost
from
his
view
wandering
in
strange
roads

and
great
was
the
multitude
that
did
enter
into
that
strange
building
and
after
they
did
enter
into
that
building
they
did
point
the
finger
of
scorn
at
me
and
those
that
were
partaking
of
the
fruit
also
but
we
heeded
them
not

these
are
the
words
of
my
father
for
as
many
as
heeded
them
had
fallen
away

and
laman
and
lemuel
partook
not
of
the
fruit
said
my
father

and
it
came
to
pass
after
my
father
had
spoken
all
the
words
of
his
dream
or
vision
which
were
many
he
said
unto
us
because
of
these
things
which
he
saw
in
a
vision
he
exceedingly
feared
for
laman
and
lemuel
yea
he
feared
lest
they
should
be
cast
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord

and
he
did
exhort
them
then
with
all
the
feeling
of
a
tender
parent
that
they
would
hearken
to
his
words
that
perhaps
the
lord
would
be
merciful
to
them
and
not
cast
them
off
yea
my
father
did
preach
unto
them

and
after
he
had
preached
unto
them
and
also
prophesied
unto
them
of
many
things
he
bade
them
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
and
he
did
cease
speaking
unto
them

nephi
chapter


and
all
these
things
did
my
father
see
and
hear
and
speak
as
he
dwelt
in
a
tent
in
the
valley
of
lemuel
and
also
a
great
many
more
things
which
cannot
be
written
upon
these
plates

and
now
as
i
have
spoken
concerning
these
plates
behold
they
are
not
the
plates
upon
which
i
make
a
full
account
of
the
history
of
my
people
for
the
plates
upon
which
i
make
a
full
account
of
my
people
i
have
given
the
name
of
nephi
wherefore
they
are
called
the
plates
of
nephi
after
mine
own
name
and
these
plates
also
are
called
the
plates
of
nephi

nevertheless
i
have
received
a
commandment
of
the
lord
that
i
should
make
these
plates
for
the
special
purpose
that
there
should
be
an
account
engraven
of
the
ministry
of
my
people

upon
the
other
plates
should
be
engraven
an
account
of
the
reign
of
the
kings
and
the
wars
and
contentions
of
my
people
wherefore
these
plates
are
for
the
more
part
of
the
ministry
and
the
other
plates
are
for
the
more
part
of
the
reign
of
the
kings
and
the
wars
and
contentions
of
my
people

wherefore
the
lord
hath
commanded
me
to
make
these
plates
for
a
wise
purpose
in
him
which
purpose
i
know
not

but
the
lord
knoweth
all
things
from
the
beginning
wherefore
he
prepareth
a
way
to
accomplish
all
his
works
among
the
children
of
men
for
behold
he
hath
all
power
unto
the
fulfilling
of
all
his
words
and
thus
it
is
amen

nephi
chapter


and
now
i
nephi
proceed
to
give
an
account
upon
these
plates
of
my
proceedings
and
my
reign
and
ministry
wherefore
to
proceed
with
mine
account
i
must
speak
somewhat
of
the
things
of
my
father
and
also
of
my
brethren

for
behold
it
came
to
pass
after
my
father
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
the
words
of
his
dream
and
also
of
exhorting
them
to
all
diligence
he
spake
unto
them
concerning
the
jews

that
after
they
should
be
destroyed
even
that
great
city
jerusalem
and
many
be
carried
away
captive
into
babylon
according
to
the
own
due
time
of
the
lord
they
should
return
again
yea
even
be
brought
back
out
of
captivity
and
after
they
should
be
brought
back
out
of
captivity
they
should
possess
again
the
land
of
their
inheritance

yea
even
six
hundred
years
from
the
time
that
my
father
left
jerusalem
a
prophet
would
the
lord
god
raise
up
among
the
jewseven
a
messiah
or
in
other
words
a
savior
of
the
world

and
he
also
spake
concerning
the
prophets
how
great
a
number
had
testified
of
these
things
concerning
this
messiah
of
whom
he
had
spoken
or
this
redeemer
of
the
world

wherefore
all
mankind
were
in
a
lost
and
in
a
fallen
state
and
ever
would
be
save
they
should
rely
on
this
redeemer

and
he
spake
also
concerning
a
prophet
who
should
come
before
the
messiah
to
prepare
the
way
of
the
lord

yea
even
he
should
go
forth
and
cry
in
the
wilderness
prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
lord
and
make
his
paths
straight
for
there
standeth
one
among
you
whom
ye
know
not
and
he
is
mightier
than
i
whose
shoes
latchet
i
am
not
worthy
to
unloose
and
much
spake
my
father
concerning
this
thing

and
my
father
said
he
should
baptize
in
bethabara
beyond
jordan
and
he
also
said
he
should
baptize
with
water
even
that
he
should
baptize
the
messiah
with
water

and
after
he
had
baptized
the
messiah
with
water
he
should
behold
and
bear
record
that
he
had
baptized
the
lamb
of
god
who
should
take
away
the
sins
of
the
world

and
it
came
to
pass
after
my
father
had
spoken
these
words
he
spake
unto
my
brethren
concerning
the
gospel
which
should
be
preached
among
the
jews
and
also
concerning
the
dwindling
of
the
jews
in
unbelief
and
after
they
had
slain
the
messiah
who
should
come
and
after
he
had
been
slain
he
should
rise
from
the
dead
and
should
make
himself
manifest
by
the
holy
ghost
unto
the
gentiles

yea
even
my
father
spake
much
concerning
the
gentiles
and
also
concerning
the
house
of
israel
that
they
should
be
compared
like
unto
an
olivetree
whose
branches
should
be
broken
off
and
should
be
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth

wherefore
he
said
it
must
needs
be
that
we
should
be
led
with
one
accord
into
the
land
of
promise
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
word
of
the
lord
that
we
should
be
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth

and
after
the
house
of
israel
should
be
scattered
they
should
be
gathered
together
again
or
in
fine
after
the
gentiles
had
received
the
fulness
of
the
gospel
the
natural
branches
of
the
olivetree
or
the
remnants
of
the
house
of
israel
should
be
grafted
in
or
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
true
messiah
their
lord
and
their
redeemer

and
after
this
manner
of
language
did
my
father
prophesy
and
speak
unto
my
brethren
and
also
many
more
things
which
i
do
not
write
in
this
book
for
i
have
written
as
many
of
them
as
were
expedient
for
me
in
mine
other
book

and
all
these
things
of
which
i
have
spoken
were
done
as
my
father
dwelt
in
a
tent
in
the
valley
of
lemuel

and
it
came
to
pass
after
i
nephi
having
heard
all
the
words
of
my
father
concerning
the
things
which
he
saw
in
a
vision
and
also
the
things
which
he
spake
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
which
power
he
received
by
faith
on
the
son
of
godand
the
son
of
god
was
the
messiah
who
should
comei
nephi
was
desirous
also
that
i
might
see
and
hear
and
know
of
these
things
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
which
is
the
gift
of
god
unto
all
those
who
diligently
seek
him
as
well
in
times
of
old
as
in
the
time
that
he
should
manifest
himself
unto
the
children
of
men

for
he
is
the
same
yesterday
today
and
forever
and
the
way
is
prepared
for
all
men
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
if
it
so
be
that
they
repent
and
come
unto
him

for
he
that
diligently
seeketh
shall
find
and
the
mysteries
of
god
shall
be
unfolded
unto
them
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
as
well
in
these
times
as
in
times
of
old
and
as
well
in
times
of
old
as
in
times
to
come
wherefore
the
course
of
the
lord
is
one
eternal
round

therefore
remember
o
man
for
all
thy
doings
thou
shalt
be
brought
into
judgment

wherefore
if
ye
have
sought
to
do
wickedly
in
the
days
of
your
probation
then
ye
are
found
unclean
before
the
judgmentseat
of
god
and
no
unclean
thing
can
dwell
with
god
wherefore
ye
must
be
cast
off
forever

and
the
holy
ghost
giveth
authority
that
i
should
speak
these
things
and
deny
them
not

nephi
chapter


for
it
came
to
pass
after
i
had
desired
to
know
the
things
that
my
father
had
seen
and
believing
that
the
lord
was
able
to
make
them
known
unto
me
as
i
sat
pondering
in
mine
heart
i
was
caught
away
in
the
spirit
of
the
lord
yea
into
an
exceedingly
high
mountain
which
i
never
had
before
seen
and
upon
which
i
never
had
before
set
my
foot

and
the
spirit
said
unto
me
behold
what
desirest
thou

and
i
said
i
desire
to
behold
the
things
which
my
father
saw

and
the
spirit
said
unto
me
believest
thou
that
thy
father
saw
the
tree
of
which
he
hath
spoken

and
i
said
yea
thou
knowest
that
i
believe
all
the
words
of
my
father

and
when
i
had
spoken
these
words
the
spirit
cried
with
a
loud
voice
saying
hosanna
to
the
lord
the
most
high
god
for
he
is
god
over
all
the
earth
yea
even
above
all
and
blessed
art
thou
nephi
because
thou
believest
in
the
son
of
the
most
high
god
wherefore
thou
shalt
behold
the
things
which
thou
hast
desired

and
behold
this
thing
shall
be
given
unto
thee
for
a
sign
that
after
thou
hast
beheld
the
tree
which
bore
the
fruit
which
thy
father
tasted
thou
shalt
also
behold
a
man
descending
out
of
heaven
and
him
shall
ye
witness
and
after
ye
have
witnessed
him
ye
shall
bear
record
that
it
is
the
son
of
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
spirit
said
unto
me
look
and
i
looked
and
beheld
a
tree
and
it
was
like
unto
the
tree
which
my
father
had
seen
and
the
beauty
thereof
was
far
beyond
yea
exceeding
of
all
beauty
and
the
whiteness
thereof
did
exceed
the
whiteness
of
the
driven
snow

and
it
came
to
pass
after
i
had
seen
the
tree
i
said
unto
the
spirit
i
behold
thou
hast
shown
unto
me
the
tree
which
is
precious
above
all

and
he
said
unto
me
what
desirest
thou

and
i
said
unto
him
to
know
the
interpretation
thereoffor
i
spake
unto
him
as
a
man
speaketh
for
i
beheld
that
he
was
in
the
form
of
a
man
yet
nevertheless
i
knew
that
it
was
the
spirit
of
the
lord
and
he
spake
unto
me
as
a
man
speaketh
with
another

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
unto
me
look
and
i
looked
as
if
to
look
upon
him
and
i
saw
him
not
for
he
had
gone
from
before
my
presence

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
looked
and
beheld
the
great
city
of
jerusalem
and
also
other
cities
and
i
beheld
the
city
of
nazareth
and
in
the
city
of
nazareth
i
beheld
a
virgin
and
she
was
exceedingly
fair
and
white

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
saw
the
heavens
open
and
an
angel
came
down
and
stood
before
me
and
he
said
unto
me
nephi
what
beholdest
thou

and
i
said
unto
him
a
virgin
most
beautiful
and
fair
above
all
other
virgins

and
he
said
unto
me
knowest
thou
the
condescension
of
god

and
i
said
unto
him
i
know
that
he
loveth
his
children
nevertheless
i
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
all
things

and
he
said
unto
me
behold
the
virgin
whom
thou
seest
is
the
mother
of
the
son
of
god
after
the
manner
of
the
flesh

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
beheld
that
she
was
carried
away
in
the
spirit
and
after
she
had
been
carried
away
in
the
spirit
for
the
space
of
a
time
the
angel
spake
unto
me
saying
look

and
i
looked
and
beheld
the
virgin
again
bearing
a
child
in
her
arms

and
the
angel
said
unto
me
behold
the
lamb
of
god
yea
even
the
son
of
the
eternal
father
knowest
thou
the
meaning
of
the
tree
which
thy
father
saw

and
i
answered
him
saying
yea
it
is
the
love
of
god
which
sheddeth
itself
abroad
in
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
wherefore
it
is
the
most
desirable
above
all
things

and
he
spake
unto
me
saying
yea
and
the
most
joyous
to
the
soul

and
after
he
had
said
these
words
he
said
unto
me
look
and
i
looked
and
i
beheld
the
son
of
god
going
forth
among
the
children
of
men
and
i
saw
many
fall
down
at
his
feet
and
worship
him

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
beheld
that
the
rod
of
iron
which
my
father
had
seen
was
the
word
of
god
which
led
to
the
fountain
of
living
waters
or
to
the
tree
of
life
which
waters
are
a
representation
of
the
love
of
god
and
i
also
beheld
that
the
tree
of
life
was
a
representation
of
the
love
of
god

and
the
angel
said
unto
me
again
look
and
behold
the
condescension
of
god

and
i
looked
and
beheld
the
redeemer
of
the
world
of
whom
my
father
had
spoken
and
i
also
beheld
the
prophet
who
should
prepare
the
way
before
him
and
the
lamb
of
god
went
forth
and
was
baptized
of
him
and
after
he
was
baptized
i
beheld
the
heavens
open
and
the
holy
ghost
come
down
out
of
heaven
and
abide
upon
him
in
the
form
of
a
dove

and
i
beheld
that
he
went
forth
ministering
unto
the
people
in
power
and
great
glory
and
the
multitudes
were
gathered
together
to
hear
him
and
i
beheld
that
they
cast
him
out
from
among
them

and
i
also
beheld
twelve
others
following
him
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
carried
away
in
the
spirit
from
before
my
face
and
i
saw
them
not

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
spake
unto
me
again
saying
look
and
i
looked
and
i
beheld
the
heavens
open
again
and
i
saw
angels
descending
upon
the
children
of
men
and
they
did
minister
unto
them

and
he
spake
unto
me
again
saying
look
and
i
looked
and
i
beheld
the
lamb
of
god
going
forth
among
the
children
of
men
and
i
beheld
multitudes
of
people
who
were
sick
and
who
were
afflicted
with
all
manner
of
diseases
and
with
devils
and
unclean
spirits
and
the
angel
spake
and
showed
all
these
things
unto
me
and
they
were
healed
by
the
power
of
the
lamb
of
god
and
the
devils
and
the
unclean
spirits
were
cast
out

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
spake
unto
me
again
saying
look
and
i
looked
and
beheld
the
lamb
of
god
that
he
was
taken
by
the
people
yea
the
son
of
the
everlasting
god
was
judged
of
the
world
and
i
saw
and
bear
record

and
i
nephi
saw
that
he
was
lifted
up
upon
the
cross
and
slain
for
the
sins
of
the
world

and
after
he
was
slain
i
saw
the
multitudes
of
the
earth
that
they
were
gathered
together
to
fight
against
the
apostles
of
the
lamb
for
thus
were
the
twelve
called
by
the
angel
of
the
lord

and
the
multitude
of
the
earth
was
gathered
together
and
i
beheld
that
they
were
in
a
large
and
spacious
building
like
unto
the
building
which
my
father
saw
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
spake
unto
me
again
saying
behold
the
world
and
the
wisdom
thereof
yea
behold
the
house
of
israel
hath
gathered
together
to
fight
against
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
lamb

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
saw
and
bear
record
that
the
great
and
spacious
building
was
the
pride
of
the
world
and
it
fell
and
the
fall
thereof
was
exceedingly
great
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
spake
unto
me
again

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
said
unto
me
look
and
behold
thy
seed
and
also
the
seed
of
thy
brethren
and
i
looked
and
beheld
the
land
of
promise
and
i
beheld
multitudes
of
people
yea
even
as
it
were
in
number
as
many
as
the
sand
of
the
sea

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
beheld
multitudes
gathered
together
to
battle
one
against
the
other
and
i
beheld
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
and
great
slaughters
with
the
sword
among
my
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
beheld
many
generations
pass
away
after
the
manner
of
wars
and
contentions
in
the
land
and
i
beheld
many
cities
yea
even
that
i
did
not
number
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
saw
a
mist
of
darkness
on
the
face
of
the
land
of
promise
and
i
saw
lightnings
and
i
heard
thunderings
and
earthquakes
and
all
manner
of
tumultuous
noises
and
i
saw
the
earth
and
the
rocks
that
they
rent
and
i
saw
mountains
tumbling
into
pieces
and
i
saw
the
plains
of
the
earth
that
they
were
broken
up
and
i
saw
many
cities
that
they
were
sunk
and
i
saw
many
that
they
were
burned
with
fire
and
i
saw
many
that
did
tumble
to
the
earth
because
of
the
quaking
thereof

and
it
came
to
pass
after
i
saw
these
things
i
saw
the
vapor
of
darkness
that
it
passed
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
and
behold
i
saw
multitudes
who
had
not
fallen
because
of
the
great
and
terrible
judgments
of
the
lord

and
i
saw
the
heavens
open
and
the
lamb
of
god
descending
out
of
heaven
and
he
came
down
and
showed
himself
unto
them

and
i
also
saw
and
bear
record
that
the
holy
ghost
fell
upon
twelve
others
and
they
were
ordained
of
god
and
chosen

and
the
angel
spake
unto
me
saying
behold
the
twelve
disciples
of
the
lamb
who
are
chosen
to
minister
unto
thy
seed

and
he
said
unto
me
thou
rememberest
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
lamb
behold
they
are
they
who
shall
judge
the
twelve
tribes
of
israel
wherefore
the
twelve
ministers
of
thy
seed
shall
be
judged
of
them
for
ye
are
of
the
house
of
israel

and
these
twelve
ministers
whom
thou
beholdest
shall
judge
thy
seed
and
behold
they
are
righteous
forever
for
because
of
their
faith
in
the
lamb
of
god
their
garments
are
made
white
in
his
blood

and
the
angel
said
unto
me
look
and
i
looked
and
beheld
three
generations
pass
away
in
righteousness
and
their
garments
were
white
even
like
unto
the
lamb
of
god
and
the
angel
said
unto
me
these
are
made
white
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
because
of
their
faith
in
him

and
i
nephi
also
saw
many
of
the
fourth
generation
who
passed
away
in
righteousness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
saw
the
multitudes
of
the
earth
gathered
together

and
the
angel
said
unto
me
behold
thy
seed
and
also
the
seed
of
thy
brethren

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
looked
and
beheld
the
people
of
my
seed
gathered
together
in
multitudes
against
the
seed
of
my
brethren
and
they
were
gathered
together
to
battle

and
the
angel
spake
unto
me
saying
behold
the
fountain
of
filthy
water
which
thy
father
saw
yea
even
the
river
of
which
he
spake
and
the
depths
thereof
are
the
depths
of
hell

and
the
mists
of
darkness
are
the
temptations
of
the
devil
which
blindeth
the
eyes
and
hardeneth
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
and
leadeth
them
away
into
broad
roads
that
they
perish
and
are
lost

and
the
large
and
spacious
building
which
thy
father
saw
is
vain
imaginations
and
the
pride
of
the
children
of
men
and
a
great
and
a
terrible
gulf
divideth
them
yea
even
the
word
of
the
justice
of
the
eternal
god
and
the
messiah
who
is
the
lamb
of
god
of
whom
the
holy
ghost
beareth
record
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
until
this
time
and
from
this
time
henceforth
and
forever

and
while
the
angel
spake
these
words
i
beheld
and
saw
that
the
seed
of
my
brethren
did
contend
against
my
seed
according
to
the
word
of
the
angel
and
because
of
the
pride
of
my
seed
and
the
temptations
of
the
devil
i
beheld
that
the
seed
of
my
brethren
did
overpower
the
people
of
my
seed

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
beheld
and
saw
the
people
of
the
seed
of
my
brethren
that
they
had
overcome
my
seed
and
they
went
forth
in
multitudes
upon
the
face
of
the
land

and
i
saw
them
gathered
together
in
multitudes
and
i
saw
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
among
them
and
in
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
i
saw
many
generations
pass
away

and
the
angel
said
unto
me
behold
these
shall
dwindle
in
unbelief

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
beheld
after
they
had
dwindled
in
unbelief
they
became
a
dark
and
loathsome
and
a
filthy
people
full
of
idleness
and
all
manner
of
abominations

chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
spake
unto
me
saying
look
and
i
looked
and
beheld
many
nations
and
kingdoms

and
the
angel
said
unto
me
what
beholdest
thou
and
i
said
i
behold
many
nations
and
kingdoms

and
he
said
unto
me
these
are
the
nations
and
kingdoms
of
the
gentiles

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
saw
among
the
nations
of
the
gentiles
the
formation
of
a
great
church

and
the
angel
said
unto
me
behold
the
formation
of
a
church
which
is
most
abominable
above
all
other
churches
which
slayeth
the
saints
of
god
yea
and
tortureth
them
and
bindeth
them
down
and
yoketh
them
with
a
yoke
of
iron
and
bringeth
them
down
into
captivity

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
beheld
this
great
and
abominable
church
and
i
saw
the
devil
that
he
was
the
founder
of
it

and
i
also
saw
gold
and
silver
and
silks
and
scarlets
and
finetwined
linen
and
all
manner
of
precious
clothing
and
i
saw
many
harlots

and
the
angel
spake
unto
me
saying
behold
the
gold
and
the
silver
and
the
silks
and
the
scarlets
and
the
finetwined
linen
and
the
precious
clothing
and
the
harlots
are
the
desires
of
this
great
and
abominable
church

and
also
for
the
praise
of
the
world
do
they
destroy
the
saints
of
god
and
bring
them
down
into
captivity

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
looked
and
beheld
many
waters
and
they
divided
the
gentiles
from
the
seed
of
my
brethren

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
said
unto
me
behold
the
wrath
of
god
is
upon
the
seed
of
thy
brethren

and
i
looked
and
beheld
a
man
among
the
gentiles
who
was
separated
from
the
seed
of
my
brethren
by
the
many
waters
and
i
beheld
the
spirit
of
god
that
it
came
down
and
wrought
upon
the
man
and
he
went
forth
upon
the
many
waters
even
unto
the
seed
of
my
brethren
who
were
in
the
promised
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
beheld
the
spirit
of
god
that
it
wrought
upon
other
gentiles
and
they
went
forth
out
of
captivity
upon
the
many
waters

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
beheld
many
multitudes
of
the
gentiles
upon
the
land
of
promise
and
i
beheld
the
wrath
of
god
that
it
was
upon
the
seed
of
my
brethren
and
they
were
scattered
before
the
gentiles
and
were
smitten

and
i
beheld
the
spirit
of
the
lord
that
it
was
upon
the
gentiles
and
they
did
prosper
and
obtain
the
land
for
their
inheritance
and
i
beheld
that
they
were
white
and
exceedingly
fair
and
beautiful
like
unto
my
people
before
they
were
slain

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
beheld
that
the
gentiles
who
had
gone
forth
out
of
captivity
did
humble
themselves
before
the
lord
and
the
power
of
the
lord
was
with
them

and
i
beheld
that
their
mother
gentiles
were
gathered
together
upon
the
waters
and
upon
the
land
also
to
battle
against
them

and
i
beheld
that
the
power
of
god
was
with
them
and
also
that
the
wrath
of
god
was
upon
all
those
that
were
gathered
together
against
them
to
battle

and
i
nephi
beheld
that
the
gentiles
that
had
gone
out
of
captivity
were
delivered
by
the
power
of
god
out
of
the
hands
of
all
other
nations

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
beheld
that
they
did
prosper
in
the
land
and
i
beheld
a
book
and
it
was
carried
forth
among
them

and
the
angel
said
unto
me
knowest
thou
the
meaning
of
the
book

and
i
said
unto
him
i
know
not

and
he
said
behold
it
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
a
jew
and
i
nephi
beheld
it
and
he
said
unto
me
the
book
that
thou
beholdest
is
a
record
of
the
jews
which
contains
the
covenants
of
the
lord
which
he
hath
made
unto
the
house
of
israel
and
it
also
containeth
many
of
the
prophecies
of
the
holy
prophets
and
it
is
a
record
like
unto
the
engravings
which
are
upon
the
plates
of
brass
save
there
are
not
so
many
nevertheless
they
contain
the
covenants
of
the
lord
which
he
hath
made
unto
the
house
of
israel
wherefore
they
are
of
great
worth
unto
the
gentiles

and
the
angel
of
the
lord
said
unto
me
thou
hast
beheld
that
the
book
proceeded
forth
from
the
mouth
of
a
jew
and
when
it
proceeded
forth
from
the
mouth
of
a
jew
it
contained
the
fulness
of
the
gospel
of
the
lord
of
whom
the
twelve
apostles
bear
record
and
they
bear
record
according
to
the
truth
which
is
in
the
lamb
of
god

wherefore
these
things
go
forth
from
the
jews
in
purity
unto
the
gentiles
according
to
the
truth
which
is
in
god

and
after
they
go
forth
by
the
hand
of
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
lamb
from
the
jews
unto
the
gentiles
thou
seest
the
formation
of
a
great
and
abominable
church
which
is
most
abominable
above
all
other
churches
for
behold
they
have
taken
away
from
the
gospel
of
the
lamb
many
parts
which
are
plain
and
most
precious
and
also
many
covenants
of
the
lord
have
they
taken
away

and
all
this
have
they
done
that
they
might
pervert
the
right
ways
of
the
lord
that
they
might
blind
the
eyes
and
harden
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men

wherefore
thou
seest
that
after
the
book
hath
gone
forth
through
the
hands
of
the
great
and
abominable
church
that
there
are
many
plain
and
precious
things
taken
away
from
the
book
which
is
the
book
of
the
lamb
of
god

and
after
these
plain
and
precious
things
were
taken
away
it
goeth
forth
unto
all
the
nations
of
the
gentiles
and
after
it
goeth
forth
unto
all
the
nations
of
the
gentiles
yea
even
across
the
many
waters
which
thou
hast
seen
with
the
gentiles
which
have
gone
forth
out
of
captivity
thou
seestbecause
of
the
many
plain
and
precious
things
which
have
been
taken
out
of
the
book
which
were
plain
unto
the
understanding
of
the
children
of
men
according
to
the
plainness
which
is
in
the
lamb
of
godbecause
of
these
things
which
are
taken
away
out
of
the
gospel
of
the
lamb
an
exceedingly
great
many
do
stumble
yea
insomuch
that
satan
hath
great
power
over
them

nevertheless
thou
beholdest
that
the
gentiles
who
have
gone
forth
out
of
captivity
and
have
been
lifted
up
by
the
power
of
god
above
all
other
nations
upon
the
face
of
the
land
which
is
choice
above
all
other
lands
which
is
the
land
that
the
lord
god
hath
covenanted
with
thy
father
that
his
seed
should
have
for
the
land
of
their
inheritance
wherefore
thou
seest
that
the
lord
god
will
not
suffer
that
the
gentiles
will
utterly
destroy
the
mixture
of
thy
seed
which
are
among
thy
brethren

neither
will
he
suffer
that
the
gentiles
shall
destroy
the
seed
of
thy
brethren

neither
will
the
lord
god
suffer
that
the
gentiles
shall
forever
remain
in
that
awful
state
of
blindness
which
thou
beholdest
they
are
in
because
of
the
plain
and
most
precious
parts
of
the
gospel
of
the
lamb
which
have
been
kept
back
by
that
abominable
church
whose
formation
thou
hast
seen

wherefore
saith
the
lamb
of
god
i
will
be
merciful
unto
the
gentiles
unto
the
visiting
of
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
israel
in
great
judgment

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
of
the
lord
spake
unto
me
saying
behold
saith
the
lamb
of
god
after
i
have
visited
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
israeland
this
remnant
of
whom
i
speak
is
the
seed
of
thy
fatherwherefore
after
i
have
visited
them
in
judgment
and
smitten
them
by
the
hand
of
the
gentiles
and
after
the
gentiles
do
stumble
exceedingly
because
of
the
most
plain
and
precious
parts
of
the
gospel
of
the
lamb
which
have
been
kept
back
by
that
abominable
church
which
is
the
mother
of
harlots
saith
the
lambi
will
be
merciful
unto
the
gentiles
in
that
day
insomuch
that
i
will
bring
forth
unto
them
in
mine
own
power
much
of
my
gospel
which
shall
be
plain
and
precious
saith
the
lamb

for
behold
saith
the
lamb
i
will
manifest
myself
unto
thy
seed
that
they
shall
write
many
things
which
i
shall
minister
unto
them
which
shall
be
plain
and
precious
and
after
thy
seed
shall
be
destroyed
and
dwindle
in
unbelief
and
also
the
seed
of
thy
brethren
behold
these
things
shall
be
hid
up
to
come
forth
unto
the
gentiles
by
the
gift
and
power
of
the
lamb

and
in
them
shall
be
written
my
gospel
saith
the
lamb
and
my
rock
and
my
salvation

and
blessed
are
they
who
shall
seek
to
bring
forth
my
zion
at
that
day
for
they
shall
have
the
gift
and
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
and
if
they
endure
unto
the
end
they
shall
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day
and
shall
be
saved
in
the
everlasting
kingdom
of
the
lamb
and
whoso
shall
publish
peace
yea
tidings
of
great
joy
how
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
shall
they
be

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
beheld
the
remnant
of
the
seed
of
my
brethren
and
also
the
book
of
the
lamb
of
god
which
had
proceeded
forth
from
the
mouth
of
the
jew
that
it
came
forth
from
the
gentiles
unto
the
remnant
of
the
seed
of
my
brethren

and
after
it
had
come
forth
unto
them
i
beheld
other
books
which
came
forth
by
the
power
of
the
lamb
from
the
gentiles
unto
them
unto
the
convincing
of
the
gentiles
and
the
remnant
of
the
seed
of
my
brethren
and
also
the
jews
who
were
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
that
the
records
of
the
prophets
and
of
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
lamb
are
true

and
the
angel
spake
unto
me
saying
these
last
records
which
thou
hast
seen
among
the
gentiles
shall
establish
the
truth
of
the
first
which
are
of
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
lamb
and
shall
make
known
the
plain
and
precious
things
which
have
been
taken
away
from
them
and
shall
make
known
to
all
kindreds
tongues
and
people
that
the
lamb
of
god
is
the
son
of
the
eternal
father
and
the
savior
of
the
world
and
that
all
men
must
come
unto
him
or
they
cannot
be
saved

and
they
must
come
according
to
the
words
which
shall
be
established
by
the
mouth
of
the
lamb
and
the
words
of
the
lamb
shall
be
made
known
in
the
records
of
thy
seed
as
well
as
in
the
records
of
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
lamb
wherefore
they
both
shall
be
established
in
one
for
there
is
one
god
and
one
shepherd
over
all
the
earth

and
the
time
cometh
that
he
shall
manifest
himself
unto
all
nations
both
unto
the
jews
and
also
unto
the
gentiles
and
after
he
has
manifested
himself
unto
the
jews
and
also
unto
the
gentiles
then
he
shall
manifest
himself
unto
the
gentiles
and
also
unto
the
jews
and
the
last
shall
be
first
and
the
first
shall
be

chapter


and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
if
the
gentiles
shall
hearken
unto
the
lamb
of
god
in
that
day
that
he
shall
manifest
himself
unto
them
in
word
and
also
in
power
in
very
deed
unto
the
taking
away
of
their
stumbling
blocks

and
harden
not
their
hearts
against
the
lamb
of
god
they
shall
be
numbered
among
the
seed
of
thy
father
yea
they
shall
be
numbered
among
the
house
of
israel
and
they
shall
be
a
blessed
people
upon
the
promised
land
forever
they
shall
be
no
more
brought
down
into
captivity
and
the
house
of
israel
shall
no
more
be
confounded

and
that
great
pit
which
hath
been
digged
for
them
by
that
great
and
abominable
church
which
was
founded
by
the
devil
and
his
children
that
he
might
lead
away
the
souls
of
men
down
to
hellyea
that
great
pit
which
hath
been
digged
for
the
destruction
of
men
shall
be
filled
by
those
who
digged
it
unto
their
utter
destruction
saith
the
lamb
of
god
not
the
destruction
of
the
soul
save
it
be
the
casting
of
it
into
that
hell
which
hath
no
end

for
behold
this
is
according
to
the
captivity
of
the
devil
and
also
according
to
the
justice
of
god
upon
all
those
who
will
work
wickedness
and
abomination
before
him

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
spake
unto
me
nephi
saying
thou
hast
beheld
that
if
the
gentiles
repent
it
shall
be
well
with
them
and
thou
also
knowest
concerning
the
covenants
of
the
lord
unto
the
house
of
israel
and
thou
also
hast
heard
that
whoso
repenteth
not
must
perish

therefore
wo
be
unto
the
gentiles
if
it
so
be
that
they
harden
their
hearts
against
the
lamb
of
god

for
the
time
cometh
saith
the
lamb
of
god
that
i
will
work
a
great
and
a
marvelous
work
among
the
children
of
men
a
work
which
shall
be
everlasting
either
on
the
one
hand
or
on
the
othereither
to
the
convincing
of
them
unto
peace
and
life
eternal
or
unto
the
deliverance
of
them
to
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
the
blindness
of
their
minds
unto
their
being
brought
down
into
captivity
and
also
into
destruction
both
temporally
and
spiritually
according
to
the
captivity
of
the
devil
of
which
i
have
spoken

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
angel
had
spoken
these
words
he
said
unto
me
rememberest
thou
the
covenants
of
the
father
unto
the
house
of
israel
i
said
unto
him
yea

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
unto
me
look
and
behold
that
great
and
abominable
church
which
is
the
mother
of
abominations
whose
founder
is
the
devil

and
he
said
unto
me
behold
there
are
save
two
churches
only
the
one
is
the
church
of
the
lamb
of
god
and
the
other
is
the
church
of
the
devil
wherefore
whoso
belongeth
not
to
the
church
of
the
lamb
of
god
belongeth
to
that
great
church
which
is
the
mother
of
abominations
and
she
is
the
whore
of
all
the
earth

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
looked
and
beheld
the
whore
of
all
the
earth
and
she
sat
upon
many
waters
and
she
had
dominion
over
all
the
earth
among
all
nations
kindreds
tongues
and
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
beheld
the
church
of
the
lamb
of
god
and
its
numbers
were
few
because
of
the
wickedness
and
abominations
of
the
whore
who
sat
upon
many
waters
nevertheless
i
beheld
that
the
church
of
the
lamb
who
were
the
saints
of
god
were
also
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
and
their
dominions
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
were
small
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
great
whore
whom
i
saw

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
beheld
that
the
great
mother
of
abominations
did
gather
together
multitudes
upon
the
face
of
all
the
earth
among
all
the
nations
of
the
gentiles
to
fight
against
the
lamb
of
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
beheld
the
power
of
the
lamb
of
god
that
it
descended
upon
the
saints
of
the
church
of
the
lamb
and
upon
the
covenant
people
of
the
lord
who
were
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
and
they
were
armed
with
righteousness
and
with
the
power
of
god
in
great
glory

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
beheld
that
the
wrath
of
god
was
poured
out
upon
that
great
and
abominable
church
insomuch
that
there
were
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
among
all
the
nations
and
kindreds
of
the
earth

and
as
there
began
to
be
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
among
all
the
nations
which
belonged
to
the
mother
of
abominations
the
angel
spake
unto
me
saying
behold
the
wrath
of
god
is
upon
the
mother
of
harlots
and
behold
thou
seest
all
these
things

and
when
the
day
cometh
that
the
wrath
of
god
is
poured
out
upon
the
mother
of
harlots
which
is
the
great
and
abominable
church
of
all
the
earth
whose
founder
is
the
devil
then
at
that
day
the
work
of
the
father
shall
commence
in
preparing
the
way
for
the
fulfilling
of
his
covenants
which
he
hath
made
to
his
people
who
are
of
the
house
of
israel

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
spake
unto
me
saying
look

and
i
looked
and
beheld
a
man
and
he
was
dressed
in
a
white
robe

and
the
angel
said
unto
me
behold
one
of
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
lamb

behold
he
shall
see
and
write
the
remainder
of
these
things
yea
and
also
many
things
which
have
been

and
he
shall
also
write
concerning
the
end
of
the
world

wherefore
the
things
which
he
shall
write
are
just
and
true
and
behold
they
are
written
in
the
book
which
thou
beheld
proceeding
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
jew
and
at
the
time
they
proceeded
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
jew
or
at
the
time
the
book
proceeded
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
jew
the
things
which
were
written
were
plain
and
pure
and
most
precious
and
easy
to
the
understanding
of
all
men

and
behold
the
things
which
this
apostle
of
the
lamb
shall
write
are
many
things
which
thou
hast
seen
and
behold
the
remainder
shalt
thou
see

but
the
things
which
thou
shalt
see
hereafter
thou
shalt
not
write
for
the
lord
god
hath
ordained
the
apostle
of
the
lamb
of
god
that
he
should
write
them

and
also
others
who
have
been
to
them
hath
he
shown
all
things
and
they
have
written
them
and
they
are
sealed
up
to
come
forth
in
their
purity
according
to
the
truth
which
is
in
the
lamb
in
the
own
due
time
of
the
lord
unto
the
house
of
israel

and
i
nephi
heard
and
bear
record
that
the
name
of
the
apostle
of
the
lamb
was
john
according
to
the
word
of
the
angel

and
behold
i
nephi
am
forbidden
that
i
should
write
the
remainder
of
the
things
which
i
saw
and
heard
wherefore
the
things
which
i
have
written
sufficeth
me
and
i
have
written
but
a
small
part
of
the
things
which
i
saw

and
i
bear
record
that
i
saw
the
things
which
my
father
saw
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
did
make
them
known
unto
me

and
now
i
make
an
end
of
speaking
concerning
the
things
which
i
saw
while
i
was
carried
away
in
the
spirit
and
if
all
the
things
which
i
saw
are
not
written
the
things
which
i
have
written
are
true
and
thus
it
is
amen

nephi
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
i
nephi
had
been
carried
away
in
the
spirit
and
seen
all
these
things
i
returned
to
the
tent
of
my
father

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
beheld
my
brethren
and
they
were
disputing
one
with
another
concerning
the
things
my
father
had
spoken
unto
them

for
he
truly
spake
many
great
things
unto
them
which
were
hard
to
be
understood
save
a
man
should
inquire
of
the
lord
and
they
being
hard
in
their
hearts
therefore
they
did
not
look
unto
the
lord
as
they
ought

and
now
i
nephi
was
grieved
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
also
because
of
the
things
which
i
had
seen
and
knew
they
must
unavoidably
come
to
pass
because
of
the
great
wickedness
of
the
children
of
men

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
was
overcome
because
of
my
afflictions
for
i
considered
that
mine
afflictions
were
great
above
all
because
of
the
destruction
of
my
people
for
i
had
beheld
their
fall

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
i
had
received
strength
i
spake
unto
my
brethren
desiring
to
know
of
them
the
cause
of
their
disputations

and
they
said
behold
we
cannot
understand
the
words
which
our
father
hath
spoken
concerning
the
natural
branches
of
the
olivetree
and
also
concerning
the
gentiles

and
i
said
unto
them
have
ye
inquired
of
the
lord

and
they
said
unto
me
we
have
not
for
the
lord
maketh
no
such
thing
known
unto
us

behold
i
said
unto
them
how
is
it
that
ye
do
not
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
how
is
it
that
ye
will
perish
because
of
the
hardness
of
your
hearts

do
ye
not
remember
the
things
which
the
lord
hath
saidif
ye
will
not
harden
your
hearts
and
ask
me
in
faith
believing
that
ye
shall
receive
with
diligence
in
keeping
my
commandments
surely
these
things
shall
be
made
known
unto
you

behold
i
say
unto
you
that
the
house
of
israel
was
compared
unto
an
olivetree
by
the
spirit
of
the
lord
which
was
in
our
father
and
behold
are
we
not
broken
off
from
the
house
of
israel
and
are
we
not
a
branch
of
the
house
of
israel

and
now
the
thing
which
our
father
meaneth
concerning
the
grafting
in
of
the
natural
branches
through
the
fulness
of
the
gentiles
is
that
in
the
latter
days
when
our
seed
shall
have
dwindled
in
unbelief
yea
for
the
space
of
many
years
and
many
generations
after
the
messiah
shall
be
manifested
in
body
unto
the
children
of
men
then
shall
the
fulness
of
the
gospel
of
the
messiah
come
unto
the
gentiles
and
from
the
gentiles
unto
the
remnant
of
our
seed

and
at
that
day
shall
the
remnant
of
our
seed
know
that
they
are
of
the
house
of
israel
and
that
they
are
the
covenant
people
of
the
lord
and
then
shall
they
know
and
come
to
the
knowledge
of
their
forefathers
and
also
to
the
knowledge
of
the
gospel
of
their
redeemer
which
was
ministered
unto
their
fathers
by
him
wherefore
they
shall
come
to
the
knowledge
of
their
redeemer
and
the
very
points
of
his
doctrine
that
they
may
know
how
to
come
unto
him
and
be
saved

and
then
at
that
day
will
they
not
rejoice
and
give
praise
unto
their
everlasting
god
their
rock
and
their
salvation
yea
at
that
day
will
they
not
receive
the
strength
and
nourishment
from
the
true
vine
yea
will
they
not
come
unto
the
true
fold
of
god

behold
i
say
unto
you
yea
they
shall
be
remembered
again
among
the
house
of
israel
they
shall
be
grafted
in
being
a
natural
branch
of
the
olivetree
into
the
true
olivetree

and
this
is
what
our
father
meaneth
and
he
meaneth
that
it
will
not
come
to
pass
until
after
they
are
scattered
by
the
gentiles
and
he
meaneth
that
it
shall
come
by
way
of
the
gentiles
that
the
lord
may
show
his
power
unto
the
gentiles
for
the
very
cause
that
he
shall
be
rejected
of
the
jews
or
of
the
house
of
israel

wherefore
our
father
hath
not
spoken
of
our
seed
alone
but
also
of
all
the
house
of
israel
pointing
to
the
covenant
which
should
be
fulfilled
in
the
latter
days
which
covenant
the
lord
made
to
our
father
abraham
saying
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
be
blessed

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
spake
much
unto
them
concerning
these
things
yea
i
spake
unto
them
concerning
the
restoration
of
the
jews
in
the
latter
days

and
i
did
rehearse
unto
them
the
words
of
isaiah
who
spake
concerning
the
restoration
of
the
jews
or
of
the
house
of
israel
and
after
they
were
restored
they
should
no
more
be
confounded
neither
should
they
be
scattered
again
and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
did
speak
many
words
unto
my
brethren
that
they
were
pacified
and
did
humble
themselves
before
the
lord

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
speak
unto
me
again
saying
what
meaneth
this
thing
which
our
father
saw
in
a
dream
what
meaneth
the
tree
which
he
saw

and
i
said
unto
them
it
was
a
representation
of
the
tree
of
life

and
they
said
unto
me
what
meaneth
the
rod
of
iron
which
our
father
saw
that
led
to
the
tree

and
i
said
unto
them
that
it
was
the
word
of
god
and
whoso
would
hearken
unto
the
word
of
god
and
would
hold
fast
unto
it
they
would
never
perish
neither
could
the
temptations
and
the
fiery
darts
of
the
adversary
overpower
them
unto
blindness
to
lead
them
away
to
destruction

wherefore
i
nephi
did
exhort
them
to
give
heed
unto
the
word
of
the
lord
yea
i
did
exhort
them
with
all
the
energies
of
my
soul
and
with
all
the
faculty
which
i
possessed
that
they
would
give
heed
to
the
word
of
god
and
remember
to
keep
his
commandments
always
in
all
things

and
they
said
unto
me
what
meaneth
the
river
of
water
which
our
father
saw

and
i
said
unto
them
that
the
water
which
my
father
saw
was
filthiness
and
so
much
was
his
mind
swallowed
up
in
other
things
that
he
beheld
not
the
filthiness
of
the
water

and
i
said
unto
them
that
it
was
an
awful
gulf
which
separated
the
wicked
from
the
tree
of
life
and
also
from
the
saints
of
god

and
i
said
unto
them
that
it
was
a
representation
of
that
awful
hell
which
the
angel
said
unto
me
was
prepared
for
the
wicked

and
i
said
unto
them
that
our
father
also
saw
that
the
justice
of
god
did
also
divide
the
wicked
from
the
righteous
and
the
brightness
thereof
was
like
unto
the
brightness
of
a
flaming
fire
which
ascendeth
up
unto
god
forever
and
ever
and
hath
no
end

and
they
said
unto
me
doth
this
thing
mean
the
torment
of
the
body
in
the
days
of
probation
or
doth
it
mean
the
final
state
of
the
soul
after
the
death
of
the
temporal
body
or
doth
it
speak
of
the
things
which
are
temporal

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
said
unto
them
that
it
was
a
representation
of
things
both
temporal
and
spiritual
for
the
day
should
come
that
they
must
be
judged
of
their
works
yea
even
the
works
which
were
done
by
the
temporal
body
in
their
days
of
probation

wherefore
if
they
should
die
in
their
wickedness
they
must
be
cast
off
also
as
to
the
things
which
are
spiritual
which
are
pertaining
to
righteousness
wherefore
they
must
be
brought
to
stand
before
god
to
be
judged
of
their
works
and
if
their
works
have
been
filthiness
they
must
needs
be
filthy
and
if
they
be
filthy
it
must
needs
be
that
they
cannot
dwell
in
the
kingdom
of
god
if
so
the
kingdom
of
god
must
be
filthy
also

but
behold
i
say
unto
you
the
kingdom
of
god
is
not
filthy
and
there
cannot
any
unclean
thing
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
wherefore
there
must
needs
be
a
place
of
filthiness
prepared
for
that
which
is
filthy

and
there
is
a
place
prepared
yea
even
that
awful
hell
of
which
i
have
spoken
and
the
devil
is
the
preparator
of
it
wherefore
the
final
state
of
the
souls
of
men
is
to
dwell
in
the
kingdom
of
god
or
to
be
cast
out
because
of
that
justice
of
which
i
have
spoken

wherefore
the
wicked
are
rejected
from
the
righteous
and
also
from
that
tree
of
life
whose
fruit
is
most
precious
and
most
desirable
above
all
other
fruits
yea
and
it
is
the
greatest
of
all
the
gifts
of
god
and
thus
i
spake
unto
my
brethren
amen

nephi
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
i
nephi
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
to
my
brethren
behold
they
said
unto
me
thou
hast
declared
unto
us
hard
things
more
than
we
are
able
to
bear

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
said
unto
them
that
i
knew
that
i
had
spoken
hard
things
against
the
wicked
according
to
the
truth
and
the
righteous
have
i
justified
and
testified
that
they
should
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day
wherefore
the
guilty
taketh
the
truth
to
be
hard
for
it
cutteth
them
to
the
very
center

and
now
my
brethren
if
ye
were
righteous
and
were
willing
to
hearken
to
the
truth
and
give
heed
unto
it
that
ye
might
walk
uprightly
before
god
then
ye
would
not
murmur
because
of
the
truth
and
say
thou
speakest
hard
things
against
us

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
did
exhort
my
brethren
with
all
diligence
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
humble
themselves
before
the
lord
insomuch
that
i
had
joy
and
great
hopes
of
them
that
they
would
walk
in
the
paths
of
righteousness

now
all
these
things
were
said
and
done
as
my
father
dwelt
in
a
tent
in
the
valley
which
he
called
lemuel

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
took
one
of
the
daughters
of
ishmael
to
wife
and
also
my
brethren
took
of
the
daughters
of
ishmael
to
wife
and
also
zoram
took
the
eldest
daughter
of
ishmael
to
wife

and
thus
my
father
had
fulfilled
all
the
commandments
of
the
lord
which
had
been
given
unto
him
and
also
i
nephi
had
been
blessed
of
the
lord
exceedingly

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
lord
spake
unto
my
father
by
night
and
commanded
him
that
on
the
morrow
he
should
take
his
journey
into
the
wilderness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
my
father
arose
in
the
morning
and
went
forth
to
the
tent
door
to
his
great
astonishment
he
beheld
upon
the
ground
a
round
ball
of
curious
workmanship
and
it
was
of
fine
brass
and
within
the
ball
were
two
spindles
and
the
one
pointed
the
way
whither
we
should
go
into
the
wilderness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
gather
together
whatsoever
things
we
should
carry
into
the
wilderness
and
all
the
remainder
of
our
provisions
which
the
lord
had
given
unto
us
and
we
did
take
seed
of
every
kind
that
we
might
carry
into
the
wilderness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
take
our
tents
and
depart
into
the
wilderness
across
the
river
laman

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
traveled
for
the
space
of
four
days
nearly
a
southsoutheast
direction
and
we
did
pitch
our
tents
again
and
we
did
call
the
name
of
the
place
shazer

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
take
our
bows
and
our
arrows
and
go
forth
into
the
wilderness
to
slay
food
for
our
families
and
after
we
had
slain
food
for
our
families
we
did
return
again
to
our
families
in
the
wilderness
to
the
place
of
shazer
and
we
did
go
forth
again
in
the
wilderness
following
the
same
direction
keeping
in
the
most
fertile
parts
of
the
wilderness
which
were
in
the
borders
near
the
red
sea

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
travel
for
the
space
of
many
days
slaying
food
by
the
way
with
our
bows
and
our
arrows
and
our
stones
and
our
slings

and
we
did
follow
the
directions
of
the
ball
which
led
us
in
the
more
fertile
parts
of
the
wilderness

and
after
we
had
traveled
for
the
space
of
many
days
we
did
pitch
our
tents
for
the
space
of
a
time
that
we
might
again
rest
ourselves
and
obtain
food
for
our
families

and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
i
nephi
went
forth
to
slay
food
behold
i
did
break
my
bow
which
was
made
of
fine
steel
and
after
i
did
break
my
bow
behold
my
brethren
were
angry
with
me
because
of
the
loss
of
my
bow
for
we
did
obtain
no
food

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
return
without
food
to
our
families
and
being
much
fatigued
because
of
their
journeying
they
did
suffer
much
for
the
want
of
food

and
it
came
to
pass
that
laman
and
lemuel
and
the
sons
of
ishmael
did
begin
to
murmur
exceedingly
because
of
their
sufferings
and
afflictions
in
the
wilderness
and
also
my
father
began
to
murmur
against
the
lord
his
god
yea
and
they
were
all
exceedingly
sorrowful
even
that
they
did
murmur
against
the
lord

now
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
having
been
afflicted
with
my
brethren
because
of
the
loss
of
my
bow
and
their
bows
having
lost
their
springs
it
began
to
be
exceedingly
difficult
yea
insomuch
that
we
could
obtain
no
food

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
did
speak
much
unto
my
brethren
because
they
had
hardened
their
hearts
again
even
unto
complaining
against
the
lord
their
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
did
make
out
of
wood
a
bow
and
out
of
a
straight
stick
an
arrow
wherefore
i
did
arm
myself
with
a
bow
and
an
arrow
with
a
sling
and
with
stones
and
i
said
unto
my
father
whither
shall
i
go
to
obtain
food

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
inquire
of
the
lord
for
they
had
humbled
themselves
because
of
my
words
for
i
did
say
many
things
unto
them
in
the
energy
of
my
soul

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
unto
my
father
and
he
was
truly
chastened
because
of
his
murmuring
against
the
lord
insomuch
that
he
was
brought
down
into
the
depths
of
sorrow

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
lord
said
unto
him
look
upon
the
ball
and
behold
the
things
which
are
written

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
my
father
beheld
the
things
which
were
written
upon
the
ball
he
did
fear
and
tremble
exceedingly
and
also
my
brethren
and
the
sons
of
ishmael
and
our
wives

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
beheld
the
pointers
which
were
in
the
ball
that
they
did
work
according
to
the
faith
and
diligence
and
heed
which
we
did
give
unto
them

and
there
was
also
written
upon
them
a
new
writing
which
was
plain
to
be
read
which
did
give
us
understanding
concerning
the
ways
of
the
lord
and
it
was
written
and
changed
from
time
to
time
according
to
the
faith
and
diligence
which
we
gave
unto
it
and
thus
we
see
that
by
small
means
the
lord
can
bring
about
great
things

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
did
go
forth
up
into
the
top
of
the
mountain
according
to
the
directions
which
were
given
upon
the
ball

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
did
slay
wild
beasts
insomuch
that
i
did
obtain
food
for
our
families

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
did
return
to
our
tents
bearing
the
beasts
which
i
had
slain
and
now
when
they
beheld
that
i
had
obtained
food
how
great
was
their
joy
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
humble
themselves
before
the
lord
and
did
give
thanks
unto
him

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
again
take
our
journey
traveling
nearly
the
same
course
as
in
the
beginning
and
after
we
had
traveled
for
the
space
of
many
days
we
did
pitch
our
tents
again
that
we
might
tarry
for
the
space
of
a
time

and
it
came
to
pass
that
ishmael
died
and
was
buried
in
the
place
which
was
called
nahom

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
daughters
of
ishmael
did
mourn
exceedingly
because
of
the
loss
of
their
father
and
because
of
their
afflictions
in
the
wilderness
and
they
did
murmur
against
my
father
because
he
had
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
saying
our
father
is
dead
yea
and
we
have
wandered
much
in
the
wilderness
and
we
have
suffered
much
affliction
hunger
thirst
and
fatigue
and
after
all
these
sufferings
we
must
perish
in
the
wilderness
with
hunger

and
thus
they
did
murmur
against
my
father
and
also
against
me
and
they
were
desirous
to
return
again
to
jerusalem

and
laman
said
unto
lemuel
and
also
unto
the
sons
of
ishmael
behold
let
us
slay
our
father
and
also
our
brother
nephi
who
has
taken
it
upon
him
to
be
our
ruler
and
our
teacher
who
are
his
elder
brethren

now
he
says
that
the
lord
has
talked
with
him
and
also
that
angels
have
ministered
unto
him
but
behold
we
know
that
he
lies
unto
us
and
he
tells
us
these
things
and
he
worketh
many
things
by
his
cunning
arts
that
he
may
deceive
our
eyes
thinking
perhaps
that
he
may
lead
us
away
into
some
strange
wilderness
and
after
he
has
led
us
away
he
has
thought
to
make
himself
a
king
and
a
ruler
over
us
that
he
may
do
with
us
according
to
his
will
and
pleasure
and
after
this
manner
did
my
brother
laman
stir
up
their
hearts
to
anger

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
was
with
us
yea
even
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
and
did
speak
many
words
unto
them
and
did
chasten
them
exceedingly
and
after
they
were
chastened
by
the
voice
of
the
lord
they
did
turn
away
their
anger
and
did
repent
of
their
sins
insomuch
that
the
lord
did
bless
us
again
with
food
that
we
did
not
perish

nephi
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
again
take
our
journey
in
the
wilderness
and
we
did
travel
nearly
eastward
from
that
time
forth
and
we
did
travel
and
wade
through
much
affliction
in
the
wilderness
and
our
women
did
bear
children
in
the
wilderness

and
so
great
were
the
blessings
of
the
lord
upon
us
that
while
we
did
live
upon
raw
meat
in
the
wilderness
our
women
did
give
plenty
of
suck
for
their
children
and
were
strong
yea
even
like
unto
the
men
and
they
began
to
bear
their
journeyings
without
murmurings

and
thus
we
see
that
the
commandments
of
god
must
be
fulfilled
and
if
it
so
be
that
the
children
of
men
keep
the
commandments
of
god
he
doth
nourish
them
and
strengthen
them
and
provide
means
whereby
they
can
accomplish
the
thing
which
he
has
commanded
them
wherefore
he
did
provide
means
for
us
while
we
did
sojourn
in
the
wilderness

and
we
did
sojourn
for
the
space
of
many
years
yea
even
eight
years
in
the
wilderness

and
we
did
come
to
the
land
which
we
called
bountiful
because
of
its
much
fruit
and
also
wild
honey
and
all
these
things
were
prepared
of
the
lord
that
we
might
not
perish
and
we
beheld
the
sea
which
we
called
irreantum
which
being
interpreted
is
many
waters

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
pitch
our
tents
by
the
seashore
and
notwithstanding
we
had
suffered
many
afflictions
and
much
difficulty
yea
even
so
much
that
we
cannot
write
them
all
we
were
exceedingly
rejoiced
when
we
came
to
the
seashore
and
we
called
the
place
bountiful
because
of
its
much
fruit

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
i
nephi
had
been
in
the
land
of
bountiful
for
the
space
of
many
days
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
arise
and
get
thee
into
the
mountain
and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
arose
and
went
up
into
the
mountain
and
cried
unto
the
lord

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
spake
unto
me
saying
thou
shalt
construct
a
ship
after
the
manner
which
i
shall
show
thee
that
i
may
carry
thy
people
across
these
waters

and
i
said
lord
whither
shall
i
go
that
i
may
find
ore
to
molten
that
i
may
make
tools
to
construct
the
ship
after
the
manner
which
thou
hast
shown
unto
me

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
told
me
whither
i
should
go
to
find
ore
that
i
might
make
tools

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
did
make
a
bellows
wherewith
to
blow
the
fire
of
the
skins
of
beasts
and
after
i
had
made
a
bellows
that
i
might
have
wherewith
to
blow
the
fire
i
did
smite
two
stones
together
that
i
might
make
fire

for
the
lord
had
not
hitherto
suffered
that
we
should
make
much
fire
as
we
journeyed
in
the
wilderness
for
he
said
i
will
make
thy
food
become
sweet
that
ye
cook
it
not

and
i
will
also
be
your
light
in
the
wilderness
and
i
will
prepare
the
way
before
you
if
it
so
be
that
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
wherefore
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
ye
shall
be
led
towards
the
promised
land
and
ye
shall
know
that
it
is
by
me
that
ye
are
led

yea
and
the
lord
said
also
that
after
ye
have
arrived
in
the
promised
land
ye
shall
know
that
i
the
lord
am
god
and
that
i
the
lord
did
deliver
you
from
destruction
yea
that
i
did
bring
you
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem

wherefore
i
nephi
did
strive
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
and
i
did
exhort
my
brethren
to
faithfulness
and
diligence

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
did
make
tools
of
the
ore
which
i
did
molten
out
of
the
rock

and
when
my
brethren
saw
that
i
was
about
to
build
a
ship
they
began
to
murmur
against
me
saying
our
brother
is
a
fool
for
he
thinketh
that
he
can
build
a
ship
yea
and
he
also
thinketh
that
he
can
cross
these
great
waters

and
thus
my
brethren
did
complain
against
me
and
were
desirous
that
they
might
not
labor
for
they
did
not
believe
that
i
could
build
a
ship
neither
would
they
believe
that
i
was
instructed
of
the
lord

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
was
exceedingly
sorrowful
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
now
when
they
saw
that
i
began
to
be
sorrowful
they
were
glad
in
their
hearts
insomuch
that
they
did
rejoice
over
me
saying
we
knew
that
ye
could
not
construct
a
ship
for
we
knew
that
ye
were
lacking
in
judgment
wherefore
thou
canst
not
accomplish
so
great
a
work

and
thou
art
like
unto
our
father
led
away
by
the
foolish
imaginations
of
his
heart
yea
he
hath
led
us
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
we
have
wandered
in
the
wilderness
for
these
many
years
and
our
women
have
toiled
being
big
with
child
and
they
have
borne
children
in
the
wilderness
and
suffered
all
things
save
it
were
death
and
it
would
have
been
better
that
they
had
died
before
they
came
out
of
jerusalem
than
to
have
suffered
these
afflictions

behold
these
many
years
we
have
suffered
in
the
wilderness
which
time
we
might
have
enjoyed
our
possessions
and
the
land
of
our
inheritance
yea
and
we
might
have
been
happy

and
we
know
that
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
of
jerusalem
were
a
righteous
people
for
they
kept
the
statutes
and
judgments
of
the
lord
and
all
his
commandments
according
to
the
law
of
moses
wherefore
we
know
that
they
are
a
righteous
people
and
our
father
hath
judged
them
and
hath
led
us
away
because
we
would
hearken
unto
his
words
yea
and
our
brother
is
like
unto
him
and
after
this
manner
of
language
did
my
brethren
murmur
and
complain
against
us

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
spake
unto
them
saying
do
ye
believe
that
our
fathers
who
were
the
children
of
israel
would
have
been
led
away
out
of
the
hands
of
the
egyptians
if
they
had
not
hearkened
unto
the
words
of
the
lord

yea
do
ye
suppose
that
they
would
have
been
led
out
of
bondage
if
the
lord
had
not
commanded
moses
that
he
should
lead
them
out
of
bondage

now
ye
know
that
the
children
of
israel
were
in
bondage
and
ye
know
that
they
were
laden
with
tasks
which
were
grievous
to
be
borne
wherefore
ye
know
that
it
must
needs
be
a
good
thing
for
them
that
they
should
be
brought
out
of
bondage

now
ye
know
that
moses
was
commanded
of
the
lord
to
do
that
great
work
and
ye
know
that
by
his
word
the
waters
of
the
red
sea
were
divided
hither
and
thither
and
they
passed
through
on
dry
ground

but
ye
know
that
the
egyptians
were
drowned
in
the
red
sea
who
were
the
armies
of
pharaoh

and
ye
also
know
that
they
were
fed
with
manna
in
the
wilderness

yea
and
ye
also
know
that
moses
by
his
word
according
to
the
power
of
god
which
was
in
him
smote
the
rock
and
there
came
forth
water
that
the
children
of
israel
might
quench
their
thirst

and
notwithstanding
they
being
led
the
lord
their
god
their
redeemer
going
before
them
leading
them
by
day
and
giving
light
unto
them
by
night
and
doing
all
things
for
them
which
were
expedient
for
man
to
receive
they
hardened
their
hearts
and
blinded
their
minds
and
reviled
against
moses
and
against
the
true
and
living
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
according
to
his
word
he
did
destroy
them
and
according
to
his
word
he
did
lead
them
and
according
to
his
word
he
did
do
all
things
for
them
and
there
was
not
any
thing
done
save
it
were
by
his
word

and
after
they
had
crossed
the
river
jordan
he
did
make
them
mighty
unto
the
driving
out
of
the
children
of
the
land
yea
unto
the
scattering
them
to
destruction

and
now
do
ye
suppose
that
the
children
of
this
land
who
were
in
the
land
of
promise
who
were
driven
out
by
our
fathers
do
ye
suppose
that
they
were
righteous
behold
i
say
unto
you
nay

do
ye
suppose
that
our
fathers
would
have
been
more
choice
than
they
if
they
had
been
righteous
i
say
unto
you
nay

behold
the
lord
esteemeth
all
flesh
in
one
he
that
is
righteous
is
favored
of
god
but
behold
this
people
had
rejected
every
word
of
god
and
they
were
ripe
in
iniquity
and
the
fulness
of
the
wrath
of
god
was
upon
them
and
the
lord
did
curse
the
land
against
them
and
bless
it
unto
our
fathers
yea
he
did
curse
it
against
them
unto
their
destruction
and
he
did
bless
it
unto
our
fathers
unto
their
obtaining
power
over
it

behold
the
lord
hath
created
the
earth
that
it
should
be
inhabited
and
he
hath
created
his
children
that
they
should
possess
it

and
he
raiseth
up
a
righteous
nation
and
destroyeth
the
nations
of
the
wicked

and
he
leadeth
away
the
righteous
into
precious
lands
and
the
wicked
he
destroyeth
and
curseth
the
land
unto
them
for
their
sakes

he
ruleth
high
in
the
heavens
for
it
is
his
throne
and
this
earth
is
his
footstool

and
he
loveth
those
who
will
have
him
to
be
their
god
behold
he
loved
our
fathers
and
he
covenanted
with
them
yea
even
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
and
he
remembered
the
covenants
which
he
had
made
wherefore
he
did
bring
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt

and
he
did
straiten
them
in
the
wilderness
with
his
rod
for
they
hardened
their
hearts
even
as
ye
have
and
the
lord
straitened
them
because
of
their
iniquity
he
sent
fiery
flying
serpents
among
them
and
after
they
were
bitten
he
prepared
a
way
that
they
might
be
healed
and
the
labor
which
they
had
to
perform
was
to
look
and
because
of
the
simpleness
of
the
way
or
the
easiness
of
it
there
were
many
who
perished

and
they
did
harden
their
hearts
from
time
to
time
and
they
did
revile
against
moses
and
also
against
god
nevertheless
ye
know
that
they
were
led
forth
by
his
matchless
power
into
the
land
of
promise

and
now
after
all
these
things
the
time
has
come
that
they
have
become
wicked
yea
nearly
unto
ripeness
and
i
know
not
but
they
are
at
this
day
about
to
be
destroyed
for
i
know
that
the
day
must
surely
come
that
they
must
be
destroyed
save
a
few
only
who
shall
be
led
away
into
captivity

wherefore
the
lord
commanded
my
father
that
he
should
depart
into
the
wilderness
and
the
jews
also
sought
to
take
away
his
life
yea
and
ye
also
have
sought
to
take
away
his
life
wherefore
ye
are
murderers
in
your
hearts
and
ye
are
like
unto
them

ye
are
swift
to
do
iniquity
but
slow
to
remember
the
lord
your
god
ye
have
seen
an
angel
and
he
spake
unto
you
yea
ye
have
heard
his
voice
from
time
to
time
and
he
hath
spoken
unto
you
in
a
still
small
voice
but
ye
were
past
feeling
that
ye
could
not
feel
his
words
wherefore
he
has
spoken
unto
you
like
unto
the
voice
of
thunder
which
did
cause
the
earth
to
shake
as
if
it
were
to
divide
asunder

and
ye
also
know
that
by
the
power
of
his
almighty
word
he
can
cause
the
earth
that
it
shall
pass
away
yea
and
ye
know
that
by
his
word
he
can
cause
the
rough
places
to
be
made
smooth
and
smooth
places
shall
be
broken
up
o
then
why
is
it
that
ye
can
be
so
hard
in
your
hearts

behold
my
soul
is
rent
with
anguish
because
of
you
and
my
heart
is
pained
i
fear
lest
ye
shall
be
cast
off
forever
behold
i
am
full
of
the
spirit
of
god
insomuch
that
my
frame
has
no
strength

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
i
had
spoken
these
words
they
were
angry
with
me
and
were
desirous
to
throw
me
into
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
as
they
came
forth
to
lay
their
hands
upon
me
i
spake
unto
them
saying
in
the
name
of
the
almighty
god
i
command
you
that
ye
touch
me
not
for
i
am
filled
with
the
power
of
god
even
unto
the
consuming
of
my
flesh
and
whoso
shall
lay
his
hands
upon
me
shall
wither
even
as
a
dried
reed
and
he
shall
be
as
naught
before
the
power
of
god
for
god
shall
smite
him

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
said
unto
them
that
they
should
murmur
no
more
against
their
father
neither
should
they
withhold
their
labor
from
me
for
god
had
commanded
me
that
i
should
build
a
ship

and
i
said
unto
them
if
god
had
commanded
me
to
do
all
things
i
could
do
them
if
he
should
command
me
that
i
should
say
unto
this
water
be
thou
earth
it
should
be
earth
and
if
i
should
say
it
it
would
be
done

and
now
if
the
lord
has
such
great
power
and
has
wrought
so
many
miracles
among
the
children
of
men
how
is
it
that
he
cannot
instruct
me
that
i
should
build
a
ship

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
said
many
things
unto
my
brethren
insomuch
that
they
were
confounded
and
could
not
contend
against
me
neither
durst
they
lay
their
hands
upon
me
nor
touch
me
with
their
fingers
even
for
the
space
of
many
days
now
they
durst
not
do
this
lest
they
should
wither
before
me
so
powerful
was
the
spirit
of
god
and
thus
it
had
wrought
upon
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
said
unto
me
stretch
forth
thine
hand
again
unto
thy
brethren
and
they
shall
not
wither
before
thee
but
i
will
shock
them
saith
the
lord
and
this
will
i
do
that
they
may
know
that
i
am
the
lord
their
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
stretched
forth
my
hand
unto
my
brethren
and
they
did
not
wither
before
me
but
the
lord
did
shake
them
even
according
to
the
word
which
he
had
spoken

and
now
they
said
we
know
of
a
surety
that
the
lord
is
with
thee
for
we
know
that
it
is
the
power
of
the
lord
that
has
shaken
us
and
they
fell
down
before
me
and
were
about
to
worship
me
but
i
would
not
suffer
them
saying
i
am
thy
brother
yea
even
thy
younger
brother
wherefore
worship
the
lord
thy
god
and
honor
thy
father
and
thy
mother
that
thy
days
may
be
long
in
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
shall
give
thee

nephi
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
worship
the
lord
and
did
go
forth
with
me
and
we
did
work
timbers
of
curious
workmanship
and
the
lord
did
show
me
from
time
to
time
after
what
manner
i
should
work
the
timbers
of
the
ship

now
i
nephi
did
not
work
the
timbers
after
the
manner
which
was
learned
by
men
neither
did
i
build
the
ship
after
the
manner
of
men
but
i
did
build
it
after
the
manner
which
the
lord
had
shown
unto
me
wherefore
it
was
not
after
the
manner
of
men

and
i
nephi
did
go
into
the
mount
oft
and
i
did
pray
oft
unto
the
lord
wherefore
the
lord
showed
unto
me
great
things

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
i
had
finished
the
ship
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
my
brethren
beheld
that
it
was
good
and
that
the
workmanship
thereof
was
exceedingly
fine
wherefore
they
did
humble
themselves
again
before
the
lord

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
unto
my
father
that
we
should
arise
and
go
down
into
the
ship

and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
after
we
had
prepared
all
things
much
fruits
and
meat
from
the
wilderness
and
honey
in
abundance
and
provisions
according
to
that
which
the
lord
had
commanded
us
we
did
go
down
into
the
ship
with
all
our
loading
and
our
seeds
and
whatsoever
thing
we
had
brought
with
us
every
one
according
to
his
age
wherefore
we
did
all
go
down
into
the
ship
with
our
wives
and
our
children

and
now
my
father
had
begat
two
sons
in
the
wilderness
the
elder
was
called
jacob
and
the
younger
joseph

and
it
came
to
pass
after
we
had
all
gone
down
into
the
ship
and
had
taken
with
us
our
provisions
and
things
which
had
been
commanded
us
we
did
put
forth
into
the
sea
and
were
driven
forth
before
the
wind
towards
the
promised
land

and
after
we
had
been
driven
forth
before
the
wind
for
the
space
of
many
days
behold
my
brethren
and
the
sons
of
ishmael
and
also
their
wives
began
to
make
themselves
merry
insomuch
that
they
began
to
dance
and
to
sing
and
to
speak
with
much
rudeness
yea
even
that
they
did
forget
by
what
power
they
had
been
brought
thither
yea
they
were
lifted
up
unto
exceeding
rudeness

and
i
nephi
began
to
fear
exceedingly
lest
the
lord
should
be
angry
with
us
and
smite
us
because
of
our
iniquity
that
we
should
be
swallowed
up
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
wherefore
i
nephi
began
to
speak
to
them
with
much
soberness
but
behold
they
were
angry
with
me
saying
we
will
not
that
our
younger
brother
shall
be
a
ruler
over
us

and
it
came
to
pass
that
laman
and
lemuel
did
take
me
and
bind
me
with
cords
and
they
did
treat
me
with
much
harshness
nevertheless
the
lord
did
suffer
it
that
he
might
show
forth
his
power
unto
the
fulfilling
of
his
word
which
he
had
spoken
concerning
the
wicked

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
they
had
bound
me
insomuch
that
i
could
not
move
the
compass
which
had
been
prepared
of
the
lord
did
cease
to
work

wherefore
they
knew
not
whither
they
should
steer
the
ship
insomuch
that
there
arose
a
great
storm
yea
a
great
and
terrible
tempest
and
we
were
driven
back
upon
the
waters
for
the
space
of
three
days
and
they
began
to
be
frightened
exceedingly
lest
they
should
be
drowned
in
the
sea
nevertheless
they
did
not
loose
me

and
on
the
fourth
day
which
we
had
been
driven
back
the
tempest
began
to
be
exceedingly
sore

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
were
about
to
be
swallowed
up
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
after
we
had
been
driven
back
upon
the
waters
for
the
space
of
four
days
my
brethren
began
to
see
that
the
judgments
of
god
were
upon
them
and
that
they
must
perish
save
that
they
should
repent
of
their
iniquities
wherefore
they
came
unto
me
and
loosed
the
bands
which
were
upon
my
wrist
and
behold
they
had
swollen
exceedingly
and
also
mine
ankles
were
much
swollen
and
great
was
the
soreness
thereof

nevertheless
i
did
look
unto
my
god
and
i
did
praise
him
all
the
day
long
and
i
did
not
murmur
against
the
lord
because
of
mine
afflictions

now
my
father
lehi
had
said
many
things
unto
them
and
also
unto
the
sons
of
ishmael
but
behold
they
did
breathe
out
much
threatenings
against
anyone
that
should
speak
for
me
and
my
parents
being
stricken
in
years
and
having
suffered
much
grief
because
of
their
children
they
were
brought
down
yea
even
upon
their
sickbeds

because
of
their
grief
and
much
sorrow
and
the
iniquity
of
my
brethren
they
were
brought
near
even
to
be
carried
out
of
this
time
to
meet
their
god
yea
their
grey
hairs
were
about
to
be
brought
down
to
lie
low
in
the
dust
yea
even
they
were
near
to
be
cast
with
sorrow
into
a
watery
grave

and
jacob
and
joseph
also
being
young
having
need
of
much
nourishment
were
grieved
because
of
the
afflictions
of
their
mother
and
also
my
wife
with
her
tears
and
prayers
and
also
my
children
did
not
soften
the
hearts
of
my
brethren
that
they
would
loose
me

and
there
was
nothing
save
it
were
the
power
of
god
which
threatened
them
with
destruction
could
soften
their
hearts
wherefore
when
they
saw
that
they
were
about
to
be
swallowed
up
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
they
repented
of
the
thing
which
they
had
done
insomuch
that
they
loosed
me

and
it
came
to
pass
after
they
had
loosed
me
behold
i
took
the
compass
and
it
did
work
whither
i
desired
it
and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
prayed
unto
the
lord
and
after
i
had
prayed
the
winds
did
cease
and
the
storm
did
cease
and
there
was
a
great
calm

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
did
guide
the
ship
that
we
sailed
again
towards
the
promised
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
we
had
sailed
for
the
space
of
many
days
we
did
arrive
at
the
promised
land
and
we
went
forth
upon
the
land
and
did
pitch
our
tents
and
we
did
call
it
the
promised
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
begin
to
till
the
earth
and
we
began
to
plant
seeds
yea
we
did
put
all
our
seeds
into
the
earth
which
we
had
brought
from
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
grow
exceedingly
wherefore
we
were
blessed
in
abundance

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
find
upon
the
land
of
promise
as
we
journeyed
in
the
wilderness
that
there
were
beasts
in
the
forests
of
every
kind
both
the
cow
and
the
ox
and
the
ass
and
the
horse
and
the
goat
and
the
wild
goat
and
all
manner
of
wild
animals
which
were
for
the
use
of
men
and
we
did
find
all
manner
of
ore
both
of
gold
and
of
silver
and
of
copper

nephi
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
commanded
me
wherefore
i
did
make
plates
of
ore
that
i
might
engraven
upon
them
the
record
of
my
people
and
upon
the
plates
which
i
made
i
did
engraven
the
record
of
my
father
and
also
our
journeyings
in
the
wilderness
and
the
prophecies
of
my
father
and
also
many
of
mine
own
prophecies
have
i
engraven
upon
them

and
i
knew
not
at
the
time
when
i
made
them
that
i
should
be
commanded
of
the
lord
to
make
these
plates
wherefore
the
record
of
my
father
and
the
genealogy
of
his
fathers
and
the
more
part
of
all
our
proceedings
in
the
wilderness
are
engraven
upon
those
first
plates
of
which
i
have
spoken
wherefore
the
things
which
transpired
before
i
made
these
plates
are
of
a
truth
more
particularly
made
mention
upon
the
first
plates

and
after
i
had
made
these
plates
by
way
of
commandment
i
nephi
received
a
commandment
that
the
ministry
and
the
prophecies
the
more
plain
and
precious
parts
of
them
should
be
written
upon
these
plates
and
that
the
things
which
were
written
should
be
kept
for
the
instruction
of
my
people
who
should
possess
the
land
and
also
for
other
wise
purposes
which
purposes
are
known
unto
the
lord

wherefore
i
nephi
did
make
a
record
upon
the
other
plates
which
gives
an
account
or
which
gives
a
greater
account
of
the
wars
and
contentions
and
destructions
of
my
people
and
this
have
i
done
and
commanded
my
people
what
they
should
do
after
i
was
gone
and
that
these
plates
should
be
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
another
or
from
one
prophet
to
another
until
further
commandments
of
the
lord

and
an
account
of
my
making
these
plates
shall
be
given
hereafter
and
then
behold
i
proceed
according
to
that
which
i
have
spoken
and
this
i
do
that
the
more
sacred
things
may
be
kept
for
the
knowledge
of
my
people

nevertheless
i
do
not
write
anything
upon
plates
save
it
be
that
i
think
it
be
sacred
and
now
if
i
do
err
even
did
they
err
of
old
not
that
i
would
excuse
myself
because
of
other
men
but
because
of
the
weakness
which
is
in
me
according
to
the
flesh
i
would
excuse
myself

for
the
things
which
some
men
esteem
to
be
of
great
worth
both
to
the
body
and
soul
others
set
at
naught
and
trample
under
their
feet
yea
even
the
very
god
of
israel
do
men
trample
under
their
feet
i
say
trample
under
their
feet
but
i
would
speak
in
other
wordsthey
set
him
at
naught
and
hearken
not
to
the
voice
of
his
counsels

and
behold
he
cometh
according
to
the
words
of
the
angel
in
six
hundred
years
from
the
time
my
father
left
jerusalem

and
the
world
because
of
their
iniquity
shall
judge
him
to
be
a
thing
of
naught
wherefore
they
scourge
him
and
he
suffereth
it
and
they
smite
him
and
he
suffereth
it
yea
they
spit
upon
him
and
he
suffereth
it
because
of
his
loving
kindness
and
his
longsuffering
towards
the
children
of
men

and
the
god
of
our
fathers
who
were
led
out
of
egypt
out
of
bondage
and
also
were
preserved
in
the
wilderness
by
him
yea
the
god
of
abraham
and
of
isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
yieldeth
himself
according
to
the
words
of
the
angel
as
a
man
into
the
hands
of
wicked
men
to
be
lifted
up
according
to
the
words
of
zenock
and
to
be
crucified
according
to
the
words
of
neum
and
to
be
buried
in
a
sepulchre
according
to
the
words
of
zenos
which
he
spake
concerning
the
three
days
of
darkness
which
should
be
a
sign
given
of
his
death
unto
those
who
should
inhabit
the
isles
of
the
sea
more
especially
given
unto
those
who
are
of
the
house
of
israel

for
thus
spake
the
prophet
the
lord
god
surely
shall
visit
all
the
house
of
israel
at
that
day
some
with
his
voice
because
of
their
righteousness
unto
their
great
joy
and
salvation
and
others
with
the
thunderings
and
the
lightnings
of
his
power
by
tempest
by
fire
and
by
smoke
and
vapor
of
darkness
and
by
the
opening
of
the
earth
and
by
mountains
which
shall
be
carried
up

and
all
these
things
must
surely
come
saith
the
prophet
zenos
and
the
rocks
of
the
earth
must
rend
and
because
of
the
groanings
of
the
earth
many
of
the
kings
of
the
isles
of
the
sea
shall
be
wrought
upon
by
the
spirit
of
god
to
exclaim
the
god
of
nature
suffers

and
as
for
those
who
are
at
jerusalem
saith
the
prophet
they
shall
be
scourged
by
all
people
because
they
crucify
the
god
of
israel
and
turn
their
hearts
aside
rejecting
signs
and
wonders
and
the
power
and
glory
of
the
god
of
israel

and
because
they
turn
their
hearts
aside
saith
the
prophet
and
have
despised
the
holy
one
of
israel
they
shall
wander
in
the
flesh
and
perish
and
become
a
hiss
and
a
byword
and
be
hated
among
all
nations

nevertheless
when
that
day
cometh
saith
the
prophet
that
they
no
more
turn
aside
their
hearts
against
the
holy
one
of
israel
then
will
he
remember
the
covenants
which
he
made
to
their
fathers

yea
then
will
he
remember
the
isles
of
the
sea
yea
and
all
the
people
who
are
of
the
house
of
israel
will
i
gather
in
saith
the
lord
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophet
zenos
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth

yea
and
all
the
earth
shall
see
the
salvation
of
the
lord
saith
the
prophet
every
nation
kindred
tongue
and
people
shall
be
blessed

and
i
nephi
have
written
these
things
unto
my
people
that
perhaps
i
might
persuade
them
that
they
would
remember
the
lord
their
redeemer

wherefore
i
speak
unto
all
the
house
of
israel
if
it
so
be
that
they
should
obtain
these
things

for
behold
i
have
workings
in
the
spirit
which
doth
weary
me
even
that
all
my
joints
are
weak
for
those
who
are
at
jerusalem
for
had
not
the
lord
been
merciful
to
show
unto
me
concerning
them
even
as
he
had
prophets
of
old
i
should
have
perished
also

and
he
surely
did
show
unto
the
prophets
of
old
all
things
concerning
them
and
also
he
did
show
unto
many
concerning
us
wherefore
it
must
needs
be
that
we
know
concerning
them
for
they
are
written
upon
the
plates
of
brass

now
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
did
teach
my
brethren
these
things
and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
did
read
many
things
to
them
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
that
they
might
know
concerning
the
doings
of
the
lord
in
other
lands
among
people
of
old

and
i
did
read
many
things
unto
them
which
were
written
in
the
books
of
moses
but
that
i
might
more
fully
persuade
them
to
believe
in
the
lord
their
redeemer
i
did
read
unto
them
that
which
was
written
by
the
prophet
isaiah
for
i
did
liken
all
scriptures
unto
us
that
it
might
be
for
our
profit
and
learning

wherefore
i
spake
unto
them
saying
hear
ye
the
words
of
the
prophet
ye
who
are
a
remnant
of
the
house
of
israel
a
branch
who
have
been
broken
off
hear
ye
the
words
of
the
prophet
which
were
written
unto
all
the
house
of
israel
and
liken
them
unto
yourselves
that
ye
may
have
hope
as
well
as
your
brethren
from
whom
ye
have
been
broken
off
for
after
this
manner
has
the
prophet
written

nephi
chapter


hearken
and
hear
this
o
house
of
jacob
who
are
called
by
the
name
of
israel
and
are
come
forth
out
of
the
waters
of
judah
or
out
of
the
waters
of
baptism
who
swear
by
the
name
of
the
lord
and
make
mention
of
the
god
of
israel
yet
they
swear
not
in
truth
nor
in
righteousness

nevertheless
they
call
themselves
of
the
holy
city
but
they
do
not
stay
themselves
upon
the
god
of
israel
who
is
the
lord
of
hosts
yea
the
lord
of
hosts
is
his
name

behold
i
have
declared
the
former
things
from
the
beginning
and
they
went
forth
out
of
my
mouth
and
i
showed
them
i
did
show
them
suddenly

and
i
did
it
because
i
knew
that
thou
art
obstinate
and
thy
neck
is
an
iron
sinew
and
thy
brow
brass

and
i
have
even
from
the
beginning
declared
to
thee
before
it
came
to
pass
i
showed
them
thee
and
i
showed
them
for
fear
lest
thou
shouldst
saymine
idol
hath
done
them
and
my
graven
image
and
my
molten
image
hath
commanded
them

thou
hast
seen
and
heard
all
this
and
will
ye
not
declare
them
and
that
i
have
showed
thee
new
things
from
this
time
even
hidden
things
and
thou
didst
not
know
them

they
are
created
now
and
not
from
the
beginning
even
before
the
day
when
thou
heardest
them
not
they
were
declared
unto
thee
lest
thou
shouldst
saybehold
i
knew
them

yea
and
thou
heardest
not
yea
thou
knewest
not
yea
from
that
time
thine
ear
was
not
opened
for
i
knew
that
thou
wouldst
deal
very
treacherously
and
wast
called
a
transgressor
from
the
womb

nevertheless
for
my
names
sake
will
i
defer
mine
anger
and
for
my
praise
will
i
refrain
from
thee
that
i
cut
thee
not
off

for
behold
i
have
refined
thee
i
have
chosen
thee
in
the
furnace
of
affliction

for
mine
own
sake
yea
for
mine
own
sake
will
i
do
this
for
i
will
not
suffer
my
name
to
be
polluted
and
i
will
not
give
my
glory
unto
another

hearken
unto
me
o
jacob
and
israel
my
called
for
i
am
he
i
am
the
first
and
i
am
also
the
last

mine
hand
hath
also
laid
the
foundation
of
the
earth
and
my
right
hand
hath
spanned
the
heavens
i
call
unto
them
and
they
stand
up
together

all
ye
assemble
yourselves
and
hear
who
among
them
hath
declared
these
things
unto
them
the
lord
hath
loved
him
yea
and
he
will
fulfill
his
word
which
he
hath
declared
by
them
and
he
will
do
his
pleasure
on
babylon
and
his
arm
shall
come
upon
the
chaldeans

also
saith
the
lord
i
the
lord
yea
i
have
spoken
yea
i
have
called
him
to
declare
i
have
brought
him
and
he
shall
make
his
way
prosperous

come

near
unto
me
i
have
not
spoken
in
secret
from
the
beginning
from
the
time
that
it
was
declared

i
spoken
and
the
lord
god
and
his
spirit
hath
sent
me

and
thus
saith
the
lord
thy
redeemer
the
holy
one
of
israel
i
have
sent
him
the
lord
thy
god
who
teacheth
thee
to
profit
who
leadeth
thee
by
the
way
thou
shouldst
go
hath
done
it

o
that
thou
hadst
hearkened
to
my
commandmentsthen
had
thy
peace
been
as
a
river
and
thy
righteousness
as
the
waves
of
the
sea

thy
seed
also
had
been
as
the
sand
the
offspring
of
thy
bowels
like
the
gravel
thereof
his
name
should
not
have
been
cut
off
nor
destroyed
from
before
me

go
ye
forth
of

flee
ye
from
the
chaldeans
with
a
voice
of
singing

earth
say
ye
the
lord
hath
redeemed
his
servant
jacob

and
they
thirsted
not
he
led
them
through
the
deserts
he
caused
the
waters
to
flow
out
of
the
rock
for
them
he
clave
the
rock
also
and
the
waters
gushed
out

and
notwithstanding
he
hath
done
all
this
and
greater
also
there
is
no
peace
saith
the
lord
unto
the
wicked

nephi
chapter


and
again
hearken
o
ye
house
of
israel
all
ye
that
are
broken
off
and
are
driven
out
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
pastors
of
my
people
yea
all
ye
that
are
broken
off
that
are
scattered
abroad
who
are
of
my
people
o
house
of
israel
listen
o
isles
unto
me
and
hearken
ye
people
from
far
the
lord
hath
called
me
from
the
womb
from
the
bowels
of
my
mother
hath
he
made
mention
of
my
name

and
he
hath
made
my
mouth
like
a
sharp
sword
in
the
shadow
of
his
hand
hath
he
hid
me
and
made
me
a
polished
shaft
in
his
quiver
hath
he
hid
me

and
said
unto
me
thou
art
my
servant
o
israel
in
whom
i
will
be
glorified

then
i
said
i
have
labored
in
vain
i
have
spent
my
strength
for
naught
and
in
vain
surely
my
judgment
is
with
the
lord
and
my
work
with
my
god

and
now
saith
the
lordthat
formed
me
from
the
womb
that
i
should
be
his
servant
to
bring
jacob
again
to
himthough
israel
be
not
gathered
yet
shall
i
be
glorious
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
and
my
god
shall
be
my
strength

and
he
said
it
is
a
light
thing
that
thou
shouldst
be
my
servant
to
raise
up
the
tribes
of
jacob
and
to
restore
the
preserved
of
israel
i
will
also
give
thee
for
a
light
to
the
gentiles
that
thou
mayest
be
my
salvation
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth

thus
saith
the
lord
the
redeemer
of
israel
his
holy
one
to
him
whom
man
despiseth
to
him
whom
the
nation
abhorreth
to
servant
of
rulers
kings
shall
see
and
arise
princes
also
shall
worship
because
of
the
lord
that
is
faithful

thus
saith
the
lord
in
an
acceptable
time
have
i
heard
thee
o
isles
of
the
sea
and
in
a
day
of
salvation
have
i
helped
thee
and
i
will
preserve
thee
and
give
thee
my
servant
for
a
covenant
of
the
people
to
establish
the
earth
to
cause
to
inherit
the
desolate
heritages

that
thou
mayest
say
to
the
prisoners
go
forth
to
them
that
sit
in
darkness
show
yourselves
they
shall
feed
in
the
ways
and
their
pastures
shall
be
in
all
high
places

they
shall
not
hunger
nor
thirst
neither
shall
the
heat
nor
the
sun
smite
them
for
he
that
hath
mercy
on
them
shall
lead
them
even
by
the
springs
of
water
shall
he
guide
them

and
i
will
make
all
my
mountains
a
way
and
my
highways
shall
be
exalted

and
then
o
house
of
israel
behold
these
shall
come
from
far
and
lo
these
from
the
north
and
from
the
west
and
these
from
the
land
of
sinim

sing
o
heavens
and
be
joyful
o
earth
for
the
feet
of
those
who
are
in
the
east
shall
be
established
and
break
forth
into
singing
o
mountains
for
they
shall
be
smitten
no
more
for
the
lord
hath
comforted
his
people
and
will
have
mercy
upon
his
afflicted

but
behold
zion
hath
said
the
lord
hath
forsaken
me
and
my
lord
hath
forgotten
mebut
he
will
show
that
he
hath
not

for
can
a
woman
forget
her
sucking
child
that
she
should
not
have
compassion
on
the
son
of
her
womb
yea
they
may
forget
yet
will
i
not
forget
thee
o
house
of
israel

behold
i
have
graven
thee
upon
the
palms
of
my
hands
thy
walls
are
continually
before
me

thy
children
shall
make
haste
against
thy
destroyers
and
they
that
made
thee
waste
shall
go
forth
of
thee

lift
up
thine
eyes
round
about
and
behold
all
these
gather
themselves
together
and
they
shall
come
to
thee
and
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
thou
shalt
surely
clothe
thee
with
them
all
as
with
an
ornament
and
bind
them
on
even
as
a
bride

for
thy
waste
and
thy
desolate
places
and
the
land
of
thy
destruction
shall
even
now
be
too
narrow
by
reason
of
the
inhabitants
and
they
that
swallowed
thee
up
shall
be
far
away

the
children
whom
thou
shalt
have
after
thou
hast
lost
the
first
shall
again
in
thine
ears
say
the
place
is
too
strait
for
me
give
place
to
me
that
i
may
dwell

then
shalt
thou
say
in
thine
heart
who
hath
begotten
me
these
seeing
i
have
lost
my
children
and
am
desolate
a
captive
and
removing
to
and
fro
and
who
hath
brought
up
these
behold
i
was
left
alone
these
where
have
they
been

thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
lift
up
mine
hand
to
the
gentiles
and
set
up
my
standard
to
the
people
and
they
shall
bring
thy
sons
in
their
arms
and
thy
daughters
shall
be
carried
upon
their
shoulders

and
kings
shall
be
thy
nursing
fathers
and
their
queens
thy
nursing
mothers
they
shall
bow
down
to
thee
with
their
face
towards
the
earth
and
lick
up
the
dust
of
thy
feet
and
thou
shalt
know
that
i
am
the
lord
for
they
shall
not
be
ashamed
that
wait
for
me

for
shall
the
prey
be
taken
from
the
mighty
or
the
lawful
captives
delivered

but
thus
saith
the
lord
even
the
captives
of
the
mighty
shall
be
taken
away
and
the
prey
of
the
terrible
shall
be
delivered
for
i
will
contend
with
him
that
contendeth
with
thee
and
i
will
save
thy
children

and
i
will
feed
them
that
oppress
thee
with
their
own
flesh
they
shall
be
drunken
with
their
own
blood
as
with
sweet
wine
and
all
flesh
shall
know
that
i
the
lord
am
thy
savior
and
thy
redeemer

nephi
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
i
nephi
had
read
these
things
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
my
brethren
came
unto
me
and
said
unto
me
what
meaneth
these
things
which
ye
have
read
behold
are
they
to
be
understood
according
to
things
which
are
spiritual
which
shall
come
to
pass
according
to
the
spirit
and
not
the
flesh

and
i
nephi
said
unto
them
behold
they
were
manifest
unto
the
prophet
by
the
voice
of
the
spirit
for
by
the
spirit
are
all
things
made
known
unto
the
prophets
which
shall
come
upon
the
children
of
men
according
to
the
flesh

wherefore
the
things
of
which
i
have
read
are
things
pertaining
to
things
both
temporal
and
spiritual
for
it
appears
that
the
house
of
israel
sooner
or
later
will
be
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
and
also
among
all
nations

and
behold
there
are
many
who
are
already
lost
from
the
knowledge
of
those
who
are
at
jerusalem
yea
the
more
part
of
all
the
tribes
have
been
led
away
and
they
are
scattered
to
and
fro
upon
the
isles
of
the
sea
and
whither
they
are
none
of
us
knoweth
save
that
we
know
that
they
have
been
led
away

and
since
they
have
been
led
away
these
things
have
been
prophesied
concerning
them
and
also
concerning
all
those
who
shall
hereafter
be
scattered
and
be
confounded
because
of
the
holy
one
of
israel
for
against
him
will
they
harden
their
hearts
wherefore
they
shall
be
scattered
among
all
nations
and
shall
be
hated
of
all
men

nevertheless
after
they
shall
be
nursed
by
the
gentiles
and
the
lord
has
lifted
up
his
hand
upon
the
gentiles
and
set
them
up
for
a
standard
and
their
children
have
been
carried
in
their
arms
and
their
daughters
have
been
carried
upon
their
shoulders
behold
these
things
of
which
are
spoken
are
temporal
for
thus
are
the
covenants
of
the
lord
with
our
fathers
and
it
meaneth
us
in
the
days
to
come
and
also
all
our
brethren
who
are
of
the
house
of
israel

and
it
meaneth
that
the
time
cometh
that
after
all
the
house
of
israel
have
been
scattered
and
confounded
that
the
lord
god
will
raise
up
a
mighty
nation
among
the
gentiles
yea
even
upon
the
face
of
this
land
and
by
them
shall
our
seed
be
scattered

and
after
our
seed
is
scattered
the
lord
god
will
proceed
to
do
a
marvelous
work
among
the
gentiles
which
shall
be
of
great
worth
unto
our
seed
wherefore
it
is
likened
unto
their
being
nourished
by
the
gentiles
and
being
carried
in
their
arms
and
upon
their
shoulders

and
it
shall
also
be
of
worth
unto
the
gentiles
and
not
only
unto
the
gentiles
but
unto
all
the
house
of
israel
unto
the
making
known
of
the
covenants
of
the
father
of
heaven
unto
abraham
saying
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
be
blessed

and
i
would
my
brethren
that
ye
should
know
that
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
cannot
be
blessed
unless
he
shall
make
bare
his
arm
in
the
eyes
of
the
nations

wherefore
the
lord
god
will
proceed
to
make
bare
his
arm
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
nations
in
bringing
about
his
covenants
and
his
gospel
unto
those
who
are
of
the
house
of
israel

wherefore
he
will
bring
them
again
out
of
captivity
and
they
shall
be
gathered
together
to
the
lands
of
their
inheritance
and
they
shall
be
brought
out
of
obscurity
and
out
of
darkness
and
they
shall
know
that
the
lord
is
their
savior
and
their
redeemer
the
mighty
one
of
israel

and
the
blood
of
that
great
and
abominable
church
which
is
the
whore
of
all
the
earth
shall
turn
upon
their
own
heads
for
they
shall
war
among
themselves
and
the
sword
of
their
own
hands
shall
fall
upon
their
own
heads
and
they
shall
be
drunken
with
their
own
blood

and
every
nation
which
shall
war
against
thee
o
house
of
israel
shall
be
turned
one
against
another
and
they
shall
fall
into
the
pit
which
they
digged
to
ensnare
the
people
of
the
lord
and
all
that
fight
against
zion
shall
be
destroyed
and
that
great
whore
who
hath
perverted
the
right
ways
of
the
lord
yea
that
great
and
abominable
church
shall
tumble
to
the
dust
and
great
shall
be
the
fall
of
it

for
behold
saith
the
prophet
the
time
cometh
speedily
that
satan
shall
have
no
more
power
over
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
for
the
day
soon
cometh
that
all
the
proud
and
they
who
do
wickedly
shall
be
as
stubble
and
the
day
cometh
that
they
must
be
burned

for
the
time
soon
cometh
that
the
fulness
of
the
wrath
of
god
shall
be
poured
out
upon
all
the
children
of
men
for
he
will
not
suffer
that
the
wicked
shall
destroy
the
righteous

wherefore
he
will
preserve
the
righteous
by
his
power
even
if
it
so
be
that
the
fulness
of
his
wrath
must
come
and
the
righteous
be
preserved
even
unto
the
destruction
of
their
enemies
by
fire
wherefore
the
righteous
need
not
fear
for
thus
saith
the
prophet
they
shall
be
saved
even
if
it
so
be
as
by
fire

behold
my
brethren
i
say
unto
you
that
these
things
must
shortly
come
yea
even
blood
and
fire
and
vapor
of
smoke
must
come
and
it
must
needs
be
upon
the
face
of
this
earth
and
it
cometh
unto
men
according
to
the
flesh
if
it
so
be
that
they
will
harden
their
hearts
against
the
holy
one
of
israel

for
behold
the
righteous
shall
not
perish
for
the
time
surely
must
come
that
all
they
who
fight
against
zion
shall
be
cut
off

and
the
lord
will
surely
prepare
a
way
for
his
people
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
words
of
moses
which
he
spake
saying
a
prophet
shall
the
lord
your
god
raise
up
unto
you
like
unto
me
him
shall
ye
hear
in
all
things
whatsoever
he
shall
say
unto
you
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
all
those
who
will
not
hear
that
prophet
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
the
people

and
now
i
nephi
declare
unto
you
that
this
prophet
of
whom
moses
spake
was
the
holy
one
of
israel
wherefore
he
shall
execute
judgment
in
righteousness

and
the
righteous
need
not
fear
for
they
are
those
who
shall
not
be
confounded
but
it
is
the
kingdom
of
the
devil
which
shall
be
built
up
among
the
children
of
men
which
kingdom
is
established
among
them
which
are
in
the
flesh

for
the
time
speedily
shall
come
that
all
churches
which
are
built
up
to
get
gain
and
all
those
who
are
built
up
to
get
power
over
the
flesh
and
those
who
are
built
up
to
become
popular
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
those
who
seek
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
and
the
things
of
the
world
and
to
do
all
manner
of
iniquity
yea
in
fine
all
those
who
belong
to
the
kingdom
of
the
devil
are
they
who
need
fear
and
tremble
and
quake
they
are
those
who
must
be
brought
low
in
the
dust
they
are
those
who
must
be
consumed
as
stubble
and
this
is
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophet

and
the
time
cometh
speedily
that
the
righteous
must
be
led
up
as
calves
of
the
stall
and
the
holy
one
of
israel
must
reign
in
dominion
and
might
and
power
and
great
glory

and
he
gathereth
his
children
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
and
he
numbereth
his
sheep
and
they
know
him
and
there
shall
be
one
fold
and
one
shepherd
and
he
shall
feed
his
sheep
and
in
him
they
shall
find
pasture

and
because
of
the
righteousness
of
his
people
satan
has
no
power
wherefore
he
cannot
be
loosed
for
the
space
of
many
years
for
he
hath
no
power
over
the
hearts
of
the
people
for
they
dwell
in
righteousness
and
the
holy
one
of
israel
reigneth

and
now
behold
i
nephi
say
unto
you
that
all
these
things
must
come
according
to
the
flesh

but
behold
all
nations
kindreds
tongues
and
people
shall
dwell
safely
in
the
holy
one
of
israel
if
it
so
be
that
they
will
repent

and
now
i
nephi
make
an
end
for
i
durst
not
speak
further
as
yet
concerning
these
things

wherefore
my
brethren
i
would
that
ye
should
consider
that
the
things
which
have
been
written
upon
the
plates
of
brass
are
true
and
they
testify
that
a
man
must
be
obedient
to
the
commandments
of
god

wherefore
ye
need
not
suppose
that
i
and
my
father
are
the
only
ones
that
have
testified
and
also
taught
them
wherefore
if
ye
shall
be
obedient
to
the
commandments
and
endure
to
the
end
ye
shall
be
saved
at
the
last
day
and
thus
it
is
amen
the
second
book
of
nephi
an
account
of
the
death
of
lehi
nephis
brethren
rebel
against
him
the
lord
warns
nephi
to
depart
into
the
wilderness
his
journeyings
in
the
wilderness
and
so
forth

nephi
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
i
nephi
had
made
an
end
of
teaching
my
brethren
our
father
lehi
also
spake
many
things
unto
them
and
rehearsed
unto
them
how
great
things
the
lord
had
done
for
them
in
bringing
them
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem

and
he
spake
unto
them
concerning
their
rebellions
upon
the
waters
and
the
mercies
of
god
in
sparing
their
lives
that
they
were
not
swallowed
up
in
the
sea

and
he
also
spake
unto
them
concerning
the
land
of
promise
which
they
had
obtainedhow
merciful
the
lord
had
been
in
warning
us
that
we
should
flee
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem

for
behold
said
he
i
have
seen
a
vision
in
which
i
know
that
jerusalem
is
destroyed
and
had
we
remained
in
jerusalem
we
should
also
have
perished

but
said
he
notwithstanding
our
afflictions
we
have
obtained
a
land
of
promise
a
land
which
is
choice
above
all
other
lands
a
land
which
the
lord
god
hath
covenanted
with
me
should
be
a
land
for
the
inheritance
of
my
seed
yea
the
lord
hath
covenanted
this
land
unto
me
and
to
my
children
forever
and
also
all
those
who
should
be
led
out
of
other
countries
by
the
hand
of
the
lord

wherefore
i
lehi
prophesy
according
to
the
workings
of
the
spirit
which
is
in
me
that
there
shall
none
come
into
this
land
save
they
shall
be
brought
by
the
hand
of
the
lord

wherefore
this
land
is
consecrated
unto
him
whom
he
shall
bring
and
if
it
so
be
that
they
shall
serve
him
according
to
the
commandments
which
he
hath
given
it
shall
be
a
land
of
liberty
unto
them
wherefore
they
shall
never
be
brought
down
into
captivity
if
so
it
shall
be
because
of
iniquity
for
if
iniquity
shall
abound
cursed
shall
be
the
land
for
their
sakes
but
unto
the
righteous
it
shall
be
blessed
forever

and
behold
it
is
wisdom
that
this
land
should
be
kept
as
yet
from
the
knowledge
of
other
nations
for
behold
many
nations
would
overrun
the
land
that
there
would
be
no
place
for
an
inheritance

wherefore
i
lehi
have
obtained
a
promise
that
inasmuch
as
those
whom
the
lord
god
shall
bring
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
shall
keep
his
commandments
they
shall
prosper
upon
the
face
of
this
land
and
they
shall
be
kept
from
all
other
nations
that
they
may
possess
this
land
unto
themselves
and
if
it
so
be
that
they
shall
keep
his
commandments
they
shall
be
blessed
upon
the
face
of
this
land
and
there
shall
be
none
to
molest
them
nor
to
take
away
the
land
of
their
inheritance
and
they
shall
dwell
safely
forever

but
behold
when
the
time
cometh
that
they
shall
dwindle
in
unbelief
after
they
have
received
so
great
blessings
from
the
hand
of
the
lordhaving
a
knowledge
of
the
creation
of
the
earth
and
all
men
knowing
the
great
and
marvelous
works
of
the
lord
from
the
creation
of
the
world
having
power
given
them
to
do
all
things
by
faith
having
all
the
commandments
from
the
beginning
and
having
been
brought
by
his
infinite
goodness
into
this
precious
land
of
promisebehold
i
say
if
the
day
shall
come
that
they
will
reject
the
holy
one
of
israel
the
true
messiah
their
redeemer
and
their
god
behold
the
judgments
of
him
that
is
just
shall
rest
upon
them

yea
he
will
bring
other
nations
unto
them
and
he
will
give
unto
them
power
and
he
will
take
away
from
them
the
lands
of
their
possessions
and
he
will
cause
them
to
be
scattered
and
smitten

yea
as
one
generation
passeth
to
another
there
shall
be
bloodsheds
and
great
visitations
among
them
wherefore
my
sons
i
would
that
ye
would
remember
yea
i
would
that
ye
would
hearken
unto
my
words

o
that
ye
would
awake
awake
from
a
deep
sleep
yea
even
from
the
sleep
of
hell
and
shake
off
the
awful
chains
by
which
ye
are
bound
which
are
the
chains
which
bind
the
children
of
men
that
they
are
carried
away
captive
down
to
the
eternal
gulf
of
misery
and
woe

awake
and
arise
from
the
dust
and
hear
the
words
of
a
trembling
parent
whose
limbs
ye
must
soon
lay
down
in
the
cold
and
silent
grave
from
whence
no
traveler
can
return
a
few
more
days
and
i
go
the
way
of
all
the
earth

but
behold
the
lord
hath
redeemed
my
soul
from
hell
i
have
beheld
his
glory
and
i
am
encircled
about
eternally
in
the
arms
of
his
love

and
i
desire
that
ye
should
remember
to
observe
the
statutes
and
the
judgments
of
the
lord
behold
this
hath
been
the
anxiety
of
my
soul
from
the
beginning

my
heart
hath
been
weighed
down
with
sorrow
from
time
to
time
for
i
have
feared
lest
for
the
hardness
of
your
hearts
the
lord
your
god
should
come
out
in
the
fulness
of
his
wrath
upon
you
that
ye
be
cut
off
and
destroyed
forever

or
that
a
cursing
should
come
upon
you
for
the
space
of
many
generations
and
ye
are
visited
by
sword
and
by
famine
and
are
hated
and
are
led
according
to
the
will
and
captivity
of
the
devil

o
my
sons
that
these
things
might
not
come
upon
you
but
that
ye
might
be
a
choice
and
a
favored
people
of
the
lord
but
behold
his
will
be
done
for
his
ways
are
righteousness
forever

and
he
hath
said
that
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
land
but
inasmuch
as
ye
will
not
keep
my
commandments
ye
shall
be
cut
off
from
my
presence

and
now
that
my
soul
might
have
joy
in
you
and
that
my
heart
might
leave
this
world
with
gladness
because
of
you
that
i
might
not
be
brought
down
with
grief
and
sorrow
to
the
grave
arise
from
the
dust
my
sons
and
be
men
and
be
determined
in
one
mind
and
in
one
heart
united
in
all
things
that
ye
may
not
come
down
into
captivity

that
ye
may
not
be
cursed
with
a
sore
cursing
and
also
that
ye
may
not
incur
the
displeasure
of
a
just
god
upon
you
unto
the
destruction
yea
the
eternal
destruction
of
both
soul
and
body

awake
my
sons
put
on
the
armor
of
righteousness
shake
off
the
chains
with
which
ye
are
bound
and
come
forth
out
of
obscurity
and
arise
from
the
dust

rebel
no
more
against
your
brother
whose
views
have
been
glorious
and
who
hath
kept
the
commandments
from
the
time
that
we
left
jerusalem
and
who
hath
been
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
god
in
bringing
us
forth
into
the
land
of
promise
for
were
it
not
for
him
we
must
have
perished
with
hunger
in
the
wilderness
nevertheless
ye
sought
to
take
away
his
life
yea
and
he
hath
suffered
much
sorrow
because
of
you

and
i
exceedingly
fear
and
tremble
because
of
you
lest
he
shall
suffer
again
for
behold
ye
have
accused
him
that
he
sought
power
and
authority
over
you
but
i
know
that
he
hath
not
sought
for
power
nor
authority
over
you
but
he
hath
sought
the
glory
of
god
and
your
own
eternal
welfare

and
ye
have
murmured
because
he
hath
been
plain
unto
you
ye
say
that
he
hath
used
sharpness
ye
say
that
he
hath
been
angry
with
you
but
behold
his
sharpness
was
the
sharpness
of
the
power
of
the
word
of
god
which
was
in
him
and
that
which
ye
call
anger
was
the
truth
according
to
that
which
is
in
god
which
he
could
not
restrain
manifesting
boldly
concerning
your
iniquities

and
it
must
needs
be
that
the
power
of
god
must
be
with
him
even
unto
his
commanding
you
that
ye
must
obey
but
behold
it
was
not
he
but
it
was
the
spirit
of
the
lord
which
was
in
him
which
opened
his
mouth
to
utterance
that
he
could
not
shut
it

and
now
my
son
laman
and
also
lemuel
and
sam
and
also
my
sons
who
are
the
sons
of
ishmael
behold
if
ye
will
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
nephi
ye
shall
not
perish
and
if
ye
will
hearken
unto
him
i
leave
unto
you
a
blessing
yea
even
my
first
blessing

but
if
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
him
i
take
away
my
first
blessing
yea
even
my
blessing
and
it
shall
rest
upon
him

and
now
zoram
i
speak
unto
you
behold
thou
art
the
servant
of
laban
nevertheless
thou
hast
been
brought
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
i
know
that
thou
art
a
true
friend
unto
my
son
nephi
forever

wherefore
because
thou
hast
been
faithful
thy
seed
shall
be
blessed
with
his
seed
that
they
dwell
in
prosperity
long
upon
the
face
of
this
land
and
nothing
save
it
shall
be
iniquity
among
them
shall
harm
or
disturb
their
prosperity
upon
the
face
of
this
land
forever

wherefore
if
ye
shall
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
the
lord
hath
consecrated
this
land
for
the
security
of
thy
seed
with
the
seed
of
my
son

chapter


and
now
jacob
i
speak
unto
you
thou
art
my
firstborn
in
the
days
of
my
tribulation
in
the
wilderness
and
behold
in
thy
childhood
thou
hast
suffered
afflictions
and
much
sorrow
because
of
the
rudeness
of
thy
brethren

nevertheless
jacob
my
firstborn
in
the
wilderness
thou
knowest
the
greatness
of
god
and
he
shall
consecrate
thine
afflictions
for
thy
gain

wherefore
thy
soul
shall
be
blessed
and
thou
shalt
dwell
safely
with
thy
brother
nephi
and
thy
days
shall
be
spent
in
the
service
of
thy
god
wherefore
i
know
that
thou
art
redeemed
because
of
the
righteousness
of
thy
redeemer
for
thou
hast
beheld
that
in
the
fulness
of
time
he
cometh
to
bring
salvation
unto
men

and
thou
hast
beheld
in
thy
youth
his
glory
wherefore
thou
art
blessed
even
as
they
unto
whom
he
shall
minister
in
the
flesh
for
the
spirit
is
the
same
yesterday
today
and
forever
and
the
way
is
prepared
from
the
fall
of
man
and
salvation
is
free

and
men
are
instructed
sufficiently
that
they
know
good
from
evil
and
the
law
is
given
unto
men
and
by
the
law
no
flesh
is
justified
or
by
the
law
men
are
cut
off
yea
by
the
temporal
law
they
were
cut
off
and
also
by
the
spiritual
law
they
perish
from
that
which
is
good
and
become
miserable
forever

wherefore
redemption
cometh
in
and
through
the
holy
messiah
for
he
is
full
of
grace
and
truth

behold
he
offereth
himself
a
sacrifice
for
sin
to
answer
the
ends
of
the
law
unto
all
those
who
have
a
broken
heart
and
a
contrite
spirit
and
unto
none
else
can
the
ends
of
the
law
be
answered

wherefore
how
great
the
importance
to
make
these
things
known
unto
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
that
they
may
know
that
there
is
no
flesh
that
can
dwell
in
the
presence
of
god
save
it
be
through
the
merits
and
mercy
and
grace
of
the
holy
messiah
who
layeth
down
his
life
according
to
the
flesh
and
taketh
it
again
by
the
power
of
the
spirit
that
he
may
bring
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
being
the
first
that
should
rise

wherefore
he
is
the
firstfruits
unto
god
inasmuch
as
he
shall
make
intercession
for
all
the
children
of
men
and
they
that
believe
in
him
shall
be
saved

and
because
of
the
intercession
for
all
all
men
come
unto
god
wherefore
they
stand
in
the
presence
of
him
to
be
judged
of
him
according
to
the
truth
and
holiness
which
is
in
him
wherefore
the
ends
of
the
law
which
the
holy
one
hath
given
unto
the
inflicting
of
the
punishment
which
is
affixed
which
punishment
that
is
affixed
is
in
opposition
to
that
of
the
happiness
which
is
affixed
to
answer
the
ends
of
the
atonement

for
it
must
needs
be
that
there
is
an
opposition
in
all
things
if
not
so
my
firstborn
in
the
wilderness
righteousness
could
not
be
brought
to
pass
neither
wickedness
neither
holiness
nor
misery
neither
good
nor
bad
wherefore
all
things
must
needs
be
a
compound
in
one
wherefore
if
it
should
be
one
body
it
must
needs
remain
as
dead
having
no
life
neither
death
nor
corruption
nor
incorruption
happiness
nor
misery
neither
sense
nor
insensibility

wherefore
it
must
needs
have
been
created
for
a
thing
of
naught
wherefore
there
would
have
been
no
purpose
in
the
end
of
its
creation
wherefore
this
thing
must
needs
destroy
the
wisdom
of
god
and
his
eternal
purposes
and
also
the
power
and
the
mercy
and
the
justice
of
god

and
if
ye
shall
say
there
is
no
law
ye
shall
also
say
there
is
no
sin
if
ye
shall
say
there
is
no
sin
ye
shall
also
say
there
is
no
righteousness
and
if
there
be
no
righteousness
there
be
no
happiness
and
if
there
be
no
righteousness
nor
happiness
there
be
no
punishment
nor
misery
and
if
these
things
are
not
there
is
no
god
and
if
there
is
no
god
we
are
not
neither
the
earth
for
there
could
have
been
no
creation
of
things
neither
to
act
nor
to
be
acted
upon
wherefore
all
things
must
have
vanished
away

and
now
my
sons
i
speak
unto
you
these
things
for
your
profit
and
learning
for
there
is
a
god
and
he
hath
created
all
things
both
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
all
things
that
in
them
are
both
things
to
act
and
things
to
be
acted
upon

and
to
bring
about
his
eternal
purposes
in
the
end
of
man
after
he
had
created
our
first
parents
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
and
in
fine
all
things
which
are
created
it
must
needs
be
that
there
was
an
opposition
even
the
forbidden
fruit
in
opposition
to
the
tree
of
life
the
one
being
sweet
and
the
other
bitter

wherefore
the
lord
god
gave
unto
man
that
he
should
act
for
himself
wherefore
man
could
not
act
for
himself
save
it
should
be
that
he
was
enticed
by
the
one
or
the
other

and
i
lehi
according
to
the
things
which
i
have
read
must
needs
suppose
that
an
angel
of
god
according
to
that
which
is
written
had
fallen
from
heaven
wherefore
he
became
a
devil
having
sought
that
which
was
evil
before
god

and
because
he
had
fallen
from
heaven
and
had
become
miserable
forever
he
sought
also
the
misery
of
all
mankind
wherefore
he
said
unto
eve
yea
even
that
old
serpent
who
is
the
devil
who
is
the
father
of
all
lies
wherefore
he
said
partake
of
the
forbidden
fruit
and
ye
shall
not
die
but
ye
shall
be
as
god
knowing
good
and
evil

and
after
adam
and
eve
had
partaken
of
the
forbidden
fruit
they
were
driven
out
of
the
garden
of
eden
to
till
the
earth

and
they
have
brought
forth
children
yea
even
the
family
of
all
the
earth

and
the
days
of
the
children
of
men
were
prolonged
according
to
the
will
of
god
that
they
might
repent
while
in
the
flesh
wherefore
their
state
became
a
state
of
probation
and
their
time
was
lengthened
according
to
the
commandments
which
the
lord
god
gave
unto
the
children
of
men
for
he
gave
commandment
that
all
men
must
repent
for
he
showed
unto
all
men
that
they
were
lost
because
of
the
transgression
of
their
parents

and
now
behold
if
adam
had
not
transgressed
he
would
not
have
fallen
but
he
would
have
remained
in
the
garden
of
eden
and
all
things
which
were
created
must
have
remained
in
the
same
state
in
which
they
were
after
they
were
created
and
they
must
have
remained
forever
and
had
no
end

and
they
would
have
had
no
children
wherefore
they
would
have
remained
in
a
state
of
innocence
having
no
joy
for
they
knew
no
misery
doing
no
good
for
they
knew
no
sin

but
behold
all
things
have
been
done
in
the
wisdom
of
him
who
knoweth
all
things

adam
fell
that
men
might
be
and
men
are
that
they
might
have
joy

and
the
messiah
cometh
in
the
fulness
of
time
that
he
may
redeem
the
children
of
men
from
the
fall
and
because
that
they
are
redeemed
from
the
fall
they
have
become
free
forever
knowing
good
from
evil
to
act
for
themselves
and
not
to
be
acted
upon
save
it
be
by
the
punishment
of
the
law
at
the
great
and
last
day
according
to
the
commandments
which
god
hath
given

wherefore
men
are
free
according
to
the
flesh
and
all
things
are
given
them
which
are
expedient
unto
man
and
they
are
free
to
choose
liberty
and
eternal
life
through
the
great
mediator
of
all
men
or
to
choose
captivity
and
death
according
to
the
captivity
and
power
of
the
devil
for
he
seeketh
that
all
men
might
be
miserable
like
unto
himself

and
now
my
sons
i
would
that
ye
should
look
to
the
great
mediator
and
hearken
unto
his
great
commandments
and
be
faithful
unto
his
words
and
choose
eternal
life
according
to
the
will
of
his
holy
spirit

and
not
choose
eternal
death
according
to
the
will
of
the
flesh
and
the
evil
which
is
therein
which
giveth
the
spirit
of
the
devil
power
to
captivate
to
bring
you
down
to
hell
that
he
may
reign
over
you
in
his
own
kingdom

i
have
spoken
these
few
words
unto
you
all
my
sons
in
the
last
days
of
my
probation
and
i
have
chosen
the
good
part
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophet
and
i
have
none
other
object
save
it
be
the
everlasting
welfare
of
your
souls
amen

and
now
i
speak
unto
you
joseph
my
lastborn
thou
wast
born
in
the
wilderness
of
mine
afflictions
yea
in
the
days
of
my
greatest
sorrow
did
thy
mother
bear
thee

and
may
the
lord
consecrate
also
unto
thee
this
land
which
is
a
most
precious
land
for
thine
inheritance
and
the
inheritance
of
thy
seed
with
thy
brethren
for
thy
security
forever
if
it
so
be
that
ye
shall
keep
the
commandments
of
the
holy
one
of
israel

and
now
joseph
my
lastborn
whom
i
have
brought
out
of
the
wilderness
of
mine
afflictions
may
the
lord
bless
thee
forever
for
thy
seed
shall
not
utterly
be
destroyed

for
behold
thou
art
the
fruit
of
my
loins
and
i
am
a
descendant
of
joseph
who
was
carried
captive
into
egypt
and
great
were
the
covenants
of
the
lord
which
he
made
unto
joseph

wherefore
joseph
truly
saw
our
day
and
he
obtained
a
promise
of
the
lord
that
out
of
the
fruit
of
his
loins
the
lord
god
would
raise
up
a
righteous
branch
unto
the
house
of
israel
not
the
messiah
but
a
branch
which
was
to
be
broken
off
nevertheless
to
be
remembered
in
the
covenants
of
the
lord
that
the
messiah
should
be
made
manifest
unto
them
in
the
latter
days
in
the
spirit
of
power
unto
the
bringing
of
them
out
of
darkness
unto
lightyea
out
of
hidden
darkness
and
out
of
captivity
unto
freedom

for
joseph
truly
testified
saying
a
seer
shall
the
lord
my
god
raise
up
who
shall
be
a
choice
seer
unto
the
fruit
of
my
loins

yea
joseph
truly
said
thus
saith
the
lord
unto
me
a
choice
seer
will
i
raise
up
out
of
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
and
he
shall
be
esteemed
highly
among
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
and
unto
him
will
i
give
commandment
that
he
shall
do
a
work
for
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
his
brethren
which
shall
be
of
great
worth
unto
them
even
to
the
bringing
of
them
to
the
knowledge
of
the
covenants
which
i
have
made
with
thy
fathers

and
i
will
give
unto
him
a
commandment
that
he
shall
do
none
other
work
save
the
work
which
i
shall
command
him
and
i
will
make
him
great
in
mine
eyes
for
he
shall
do
my
work

and
he
shall
be
great
like
unto
moses
whom
i
have
said
i
would
raise
up
unto
you
to
deliver
my
people
o
house
of
israel

and
moses
will
i
raise
up
to
deliver
thy
people
out
of
the
land
of
egypt

but
a
seer
will
i
raise
up
out
of
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
and
unto
him
will
i
give
power
to
bring
forth
my
word
unto
the
seed
of
thy
loinsand
not
to
the
bringing
forth
my
word
only
saith
the
lord
but
to
the
convincing
them
of
my
word
which
shall
have
already
gone
forth
among
them

wherefore
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
shall
write
and
the
fruit
of
the
loins
of
judah
shall
write
and
that
which
shall
be
written
by
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
and
also
that
which
shall
be
written
by
the
fruit
of
the
loins
of
judah
shall
grow
together
unto
the
confounding
of
false
doctrines
and
laying
down
of
contentions
and
establishing
peace
among
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
and
bringing
them
to
the
knowledge
of
their
fathers
in
the
latter
days
and
also
to
the
knowledge
of
my
covenants
saith
the
lord

and
out
of
weakness
he
shall
be
made
strong
in
that
day
when
my
work
shall
commence
among
all
my
people
unto
the
restoring
thee
o
house
of
israel
saith
the
lord

and
thus
prophesied
joseph
saying
behold
that
seer
will
the
lord
bless
and
they
that
seek
to
destroy
him
shall
be
confounded
for
this
promise
which
i
have
obtained
of
the
lord
of
the
fruit
of
my
loins
shall
be
fulfilled
behold
i
am
sure
of
the
fulfilling
of
this
promise

and
his
name
shall
be
called
after
me
and
it
shall
be
after
the
name
of
his
father
and
he
shall
be
like
unto
me
for
the
thing
which
the
lord
shall
bring
forth
by
his
hand
by
the
power
of
the
lord
shall
bring
my
people
unto
salvation

yea
thus
prophesied
joseph
i
am
sure
of
this
thing
even
as
i
am
sure
of
the
promise
of
moses
for
the
lord
hath
said
unto
me
i
will
preserve
thy
seed
forever

and
the
lord
hath
said
i
will
raise
up
a
moses
and
i
will
give
power
unto
him
in
a
rod
and
i
will
give
judgment
unto
him
in
writing
yet
i
will
not
loose
his
tongue
that
he
shall
speak
much
for
i
will
not
make
him
mighty
in
speaking
but
i
will
write
unto
him
my
law
by
the
finger
of
mine
own
hand
and
i
will
make
a
spokesman
for
him

and
the
lord
said
unto
me
also
i
will
raise
up
unto
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
and
i
will
make
for
him
a
spokesman
and
i
behold
i
will
give
unto
him
that
he
shall
write
the
writing
of
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
unto
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
and
the
spokesman
of
thy
loins
shall
declare
it

and
the
words
which
he
shall
write
shall
be
the
words
which
are
expedient
in
my
wisdom
should
go
forth
unto
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
and
it
shall
be
as
if
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
had
cried
unto
them
from
the
dust
for
i
know
their
faith

and
they
shall
cry
from
the
dust
yea
even
repentance
unto
their
brethren
even
after
many
generations
have
gone
by
them
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
their
cry
shall
go
even
according
to
the
simpleness
of
their
words

because
of
their
faith
their
words
shall
proceed
forth
out
of
my
mouth
unto
their
brethren
who
are
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
and
the
weakness
of
their
words
will
i
make
strong
in
their
faith
unto
the
remembering
of
my
covenant
which
i
made
unto
thy
fathers

and
now
behold
my
son
joseph
after
this
manner
did
my
father
of
old
prophesy

wherefore
because
of
this
covenant
thou
art
blessed
for
thy
seed
shall
not
be
destroyed
for
they
shall
hearken
unto
the
words
of
the
book

and
there
shall
rise
up
one
mighty
among
them
who
shall
do
much
good
both
in
word
and
in
deed
being
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
god
with
exceeding
faith
to
work
mighty
wonders
and
do
that
thing
which
is
great
in
the
sight
of
god
unto
the
bringing
to
pass
much
restoration
unto
the
house
of
israel
and
unto
the
seed
of
thy
brethren

and
now
blessed
art
thou
joseph
behold
thou
art
little
wherefore
hearken
unto
the
words
of
thy
brother
nephi
and
it
shall
be
done
unto
thee
even
according
to
the
words
which
i
have
spoken
remember
the
words
of
thy
dying
father
amen

nephi
chapter


and
now
i
nephi
speak
concerning
the
prophecies
of
which
my
father
hath
spoken
concerning
joseph
who
was
carried
into
egypt

for
behold
he
truly
prophesied
concerning
all
his
seed
and
the
prophecies
which
he
wrote
there
are
not
many
greater
and
he
prophesied
concerning
us
and
our
future
generations
and
they
are
written
upon
the
plates
of
brass

wherefore
after
my
father
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
concerning
the
prophecies
of
joseph
he
called
the
children
of
laman
his
sons
and
his
daughters
and
said
unto
them
behold
my
sons
and
my
daughters
who
are
the
sons
and
the
daughters
of
my
firstborn
i
would
that
ye
should
give
ear
unto
my
words

for
the
lord
god
hath
said
that
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
land
and
inasmuch
as
ye
will
not
keep
my
commandments
ye
shall
be
cut
off
from
my
presence

but
behold
my
sons
and
my
daughters
i
cannot
go
down
to
my
grave
save
i
should
leave
a
blessing
upon
you
for
behold
i
know
that
if
ye
are
brought
up
in
the
way
ye
should
go
ye
will
not
depart
from
it

wherefore
if
ye
are
cursed
behold
i
leave
my
blessing
upon
you
that
the
cursing
may
be
taken
from
you
and
be
answered
upon
the
heads
of
your
parents

wherefore
because
of
my
blessing
the
lord
god
will
not
suffer
that
ye
shall
perish
wherefore
he
will
be
merciful
unto
you
and
unto
your
seed
forever

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
my
father
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
to
the
sons
and
daughters
of
laman
he
caused
the
sons
and
daughters
of
lemuel
to
be
brought
before
him

and
he
spake
unto
them
saying
behold
my
sons
and
my
daughters
who
are
the
sons
and
the
daughters
of
my
second
son
behold
i
leave
unto
you
the
same
blessing
which
i
left
unto
the
sons
and
daughters
of
laman
wherefore
thou
shalt
not
utterly
be
destroyed
but
in
the
end
thy
seed
shall
be
blessed

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
my
father
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
them
behold
he
spake
unto
the
sons
of
ishmael
yea
and
even
all
his
household

and
after
he
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
them
he
spake
unto
sam
saying
blessed
art
thou
and
thy
seed
for
thou
shall
inherit
the
land
like
unto
thy
brother
nephi
and
thy
seed
shall
be
numbered
with
his
seed
and
thou
shalt
be
even
like
unto
thy
brother
and
thy
seed
like
unto
his
seed
and
thou
shalt
be
blessed
in
all
thy
days

and
it
came
to
pass
after
my
father
lehi
had
spoken
unto
all
his
household
according
to
the
feelings
of
his
heart
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
which
was
in
him
he
waxed
old
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
died
and
was
buried

and
it
came
to
pass
that
not
many
days
after
his
death
laman
and
lemuel
and
the
sons
of
ishmael
were
angry
with
me
because
of
the
admonitions
of
the
lord

for
i
nephi
was
constrained
to
speak
unto
them
according
to
his
word
for
i
had
spoken
many
things
unto
them
and
also
my
father
before
his
death
many
of
which
sayings
are
written
upon
mine
other
plates
for
a
more
history
part
are
written
upon
mine
other
plates

and
upon
these
i
write
the
things
of
my
soul
and
many
of
the
scriptures
which
are
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
for
my
soul
delighteth
in
the
scriptures
and
my
heart
pondereth
them
and
writeth
them
for
the
learning
and
the
profit
of
my
children

behold
my
soul
delighteth
in
the
things
of
the
lord
and
my
heart
pondereth
continually
upon
the
things
which
i
have
seen
and
heard

nevertheless
notwithstanding
the
great
goodness
of
the
lord
in
showing
me
his
great
and
marvelous
works
my
heart
exclaimeth
o
wretched
man
that
i
am
yea
my
heart
sorroweth
because
of
my
flesh
my
soul
grieveth
because
of
mine
iniquities

i
am
encompassed
about
because
of
the
temptations
and
the
sins
which
do
so
easily
beset
me

and
when
i
desire
to
rejoice
my
heart
groaneth
because
of
my
sins
nevertheless
i
know
in
whom
i
have
trusted

my
god
hath
been
my
support
he
hath
led
me
through
mine
afflictions
in
the
wilderness
and
he
hath
preserved
me
upon
the
waters
of
the
great
deep

he
hath
filled
me
with
his
love
even
unto
the
consuming
of
my
flesh

he
hath
confounded
mine
enemies
unto
the
causing
of
them
to
quake
before
me

behold
he
hath
heard
my
cry
by
day
and
he
hath
given
me
knowledge
by
visions
in
the
nighttime

and
by
day
have
i
waxed
bold
in
mighty
prayer
before
him
yea
my
voice
have
i
sent
up
on
high
and
angels
came
down
and
ministered
unto
me

and
upon
the
wings
of
his
spirit
hath
my
body
been
carried
away
upon
exceedingly
high
mountains
and
mine
eyes
have
beheld
great
things
yea
even
too
great
for
man
therefore
i
was
bidden
that
i
should
not
write
them

o
then
if
i
have
seen
so
great
things
if
the
lord
in
his
condescension
unto
the
children
of
men
hath
visited
men
in
so
much
mercy
why
should
my
heart
weep
and
my
soul
linger
in
the
valley
of
sorrow
and
my
flesh
waste
away
and
my
strength
slacken
because
of
mine
afflictions

and
why
should
i
yield
to
sin
because
of
my
flesh
yea
why
should
i
give
way
to
temptations
that
the
evil
one
have
place
in
my
heart
to
destroy
my
peace
and
afflict
my
soul
why
am
i
angry
because
of
mine
enemy

awake
my
soul
no
longer
droop
in
sin
rejoice
o
my
heart
and
give
place
no
more
for
the
enemy
of
my
soul

do
not
anger
again
because
of
mine
enemies
do
not
slacken
my
strength
because
of
mine
afflictions

rejoice
o
my
heart
and
cry
unto
the
lord
and
say
o
lord
i
will
praise
thee
forever
yea
my
soul
will
rejoice
in
thee
my
god
and
the
rock
of
my
salvation

o
lord
wilt
thou
redeem
my
soul
wilt
thou
deliver
me
out
of
the
hands
of
mine
enemies
wilt
thou
make
me
that
i
may
shake
at
the
appearance
of
sin

may
the
gates
of
hell
be
shut
continually
before
me
because
that
my
heart
is
broken
and
my
spirit
is
contrite
o
lord
wilt
thou
not
shut
the
gates
of
thy
righteousness
before
me
that
i
may
walk
in
the
path
of
the
low
valley
that
i
may
be
strict
in
the
plain
road

o
lord
wilt
thou
encircle
me
around
in
the
robe
of
thy
righteousness
o
lord
wilt
thou
make
a
way
for
mine
escape
before
mine
enemies
wilt
thou
make
my
path
straight
before
me
wilt
thou
not
place
a
stumbling
block
in
my
waybut
that
thou
wouldst
clear
my
way
before
me
and
hedge
not
up
my
way
but
the
ways
of
mine
enemy

o
lord
i
have
trusted
in
thee
and
i
will
trust
in
thee
forever
i
will
not
put
my
trust
in
the
arm
of
flesh
for
i
know
that
cursed
is
he
that
putteth
his
trust
in
the
arm
of
flesh
yea
cursed
is
he
that
putteth
his
trust
in
man
or
maketh
flesh
his
arm

yea
i
know
that
god
will
give
liberally
to
him
that
asketh
yea
my
god
will
give
me
if
i
ask
not
amiss
therefore
i
will
lift
up
my
voice
unto
thee
yea
i
will
cry
unto
thee
my
god
the
rock
of
my
righteousness
behold
my
voice
shall
forever
ascend
up
unto
thee
my
rock
and
mine
everlasting
god

nephi
chapter


behold
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
did
cry
much
unto
the
lord
my
god
because
of
the
anger
of
my
brethren

but
behold
their
anger
did
increase
against
me
insomuch
that
they
did
seek
to
take
away
my
life

yea
they
did
murmur
against
me
saying
our
younger
brother
thinks
to
rule
over
us
and
we
have
had
much
trial
because
of
him
wherefore
now
let
us
slay
him
that
we
may
not
be
afflicted
more
because
of
his
words
for
behold
we
will
not
have
him
to
be
our
ruler
for
it
belongs
unto
us
who
are
the
elder
brethren
to
rule
over
this
people

now
i
do
not
write
upon
these
plates
all
the
words
which
they
murmured
against
me
but
it
sufficeth
me
to
say
that
they
did
seek
to
take
away
my
life

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
did
warn
me
that
i
nephi
should
depart
from
them
and
flee
into
the
wilderness
and
all
those
who
would
go
with
me

wherefore
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
did
take
my
family
and
also
zoram
and
his
family
and
sam
mine
elder
brother
and
his
family
and
jacob
and
joseph
my
younger
brethren
and
also
my
sisters
and
all
those
who
would
go
with
me
and
all
those
who
would
go
with
me
were
those
who
believed
in
the
warnings
and
the
revelations
of
god
wherefore
they
did
hearken
unto
my
words

and
we
did
take
our
tents
and
whatsoever
things
were
possible
for
us
and
did
journey
in
the
wilderness
for
the
space
of
many
days
and
after
we
had
journeyed
for
the
space
of
many
days
we
did
pitch
our
tents

and
my
people
would
that
we
should
call
the
name
of
the
place
nephi
wherefore
we
did
call
it
nephi

and
all
those
who
were
with
me
did
take
upon
them
to
call
themselves
the
people
of
nephi

and
we
did
observe
to
keep
the
judgments
and
the
statutes
and
the
commandments
of
the
lord
in
all
things
according
to
the
law
of
moses

and
the
lord
was
with
us
and
we
did
prosper
exceedingly
for
we
did
sow
seed
and
we
did
reap
again
in
abundance
and
we
began
to
raise
flocks
and
herds
and
animals
of
every
kind

and
i
nephi
had
also
brought
the
records
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
and
also
the
ball
or
compass
which
was
prepared
for
my
father
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
according
to
that
which
is
written

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
began
to
prosper
exceedingly
and
to
multiply
in
the
land

and
i
nephi
did
take
the
sword
of
laban
and
after
the
manner
of
it
did
make
many
swords
lest
by
any
means
the
people
who
were
now
called
lamanites
should
come
upon
us
and
destroy
us
for
i
knew
their
hatred
towards
me
and
my
children
and
those
who
were
called
my
people

and
i
did
teach
my
people
to
build
buildings
and
to
work
in
all
manner
of
wood
and
of
iron
and
of
copper
and
of
brass
and
of
steel
and
of
gold
and
of
silver
and
of
precious
ores
which
were
in
great
abundance

and
i
nephi
did
build
a
temple
and
i
did
construct
it
after
the
manner
of
the
temple
of
solomon
save
it
were
not
built
of
so
many
precious
things
for
they
were
not
to
be
found
upon
the
land
wherefore
it
could
not
be
built
like
unto
solomons
temple
but
the
manner
of
the
construction
was
like
unto
the
temple
of
solomon
and
the
workmanship
thereof
was
exceedingly
fine

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
did
cause
my
people
to
be
industrious
and
to
labor
with
their
hands

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
would
that
i
should
be
their
king
but
i
nephi
was
desirous
that
they
should
have
no
king
nevertheless
i
did
for
them
according
to
that
which
was
in
my
power

and
behold
the
words
of
the
lord
had
been
fulfilled
unto
my
brethren
which
he
spake
concerning
them
that
i
should
be
their
ruler
and
their
teacher
wherefore
i
had
been
their
ruler
and
their
teacher
according
to
the
commandments
of
the
lord
until
the
time
they
sought
to
take
away
my
life

wherefore
the
word
of
the
lord
was
fulfilled
which
he
spake
unto
me
saying
that
inasmuch
as
they
will
not
hearken
unto
thy
words
they
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
behold
they
were
cut
off
from
his
presence

and
he
had
caused
the
cursing
to
come
upon
them
yea
even
a
sore
cursing
because
of
their
iniquity
for
behold
they
had
hardened
their
hearts
against
him
that
they
had
become
like
unto
a
flint
wherefore
as
they
were
white
and
exceedingly
fair
and
delightsome
that
they
might
not
be
enticing
unto
my
people
the
lord
god
did
cause
a
skin
of
blackness
to
come
upon
them

and
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
cause
that
they
shall
be
loathsome
unto
thy
people
save
they
shall
repent
of
their
iniquities

and
cursed
shall
be
the
seed
of
him
that
mixeth
with
their
seed
for
they
shall
be
cursed
even
with
the
same
cursing
and
the
lord
spake
it
and
it
was
done

and
because
of
their
cursing
which
was
upon
them
they
did
become
an
idle
people
full
of
mischief
and
subtlety
and
did
seek
in
the
wilderness
for
beasts
of
prey

and
the
lord
god
said
unto
me
they
shall
be
a
scourge
unto
thy
seed
to
stir
them
up
in
remembrance
of
me
and
inasmuch
as
they
will
not
remember
me
and
hearken
unto
my
words
they
shall
scourge
them
even
unto
destruction

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
nephi
did
consecrate
jacob
and
joseph
that
they
should
be
priests
and
teachers
over
the
land
of
my
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
lived
after
the
manner
of
happiness

and
thirty
years
had
passed
away
from
the
time
we
left
jerusalem

and
i
nephi
had
kept
the
records
upon
my
plates
which
i
had
made
of
my
people
thus
far

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
god
said
unto
me
make
other
plates
and
thou
shalt
engraven
many
things
upon
them
which
are
good
in
my
sight
for
the
profit
of
thy
people

wherefore
i
nephi
to
be
obedient
to
the
commandments
of
the
lord
went
and
made
these
plates
upon
which
i
have
engraven
these
things

and
i
engraved
that
which
is
pleasing
unto
god
and
if
my
people
are
pleased
with
the
things
of
god
they
will
be
pleased
with
mine
engravings
which
are
upon
these
plates

and
if
my
people
desire
to
know
the
more
particular
part
of
the
history
of
my
people
they
must
search
mine
other
plates

and
it
sufficeth
me
to
say
that
forty
years
had
passed
away
and
we
had
already
had
wars
and
contentions
with
our
brethren

the
words
of
jacob
the
brother
of
nephi
which
he
spake
unto
the
people
of
nephi

behold
my
beloved
brethren
i
jacob
having
been
called
of
god
and
ordained
after
the
manner
of
his
holy
order
and
having
been
consecrated
by
my
brother
nephi
unto
whom
ye
look
as
a
king
or
a
protector
and
on
whom
ye
depend
for
safety
behold
ye
know
that
i
have
spoken
unto
you
exceedingly
many
things

nevertheless
i
speak
unto
you
again
for
i
am
desirous
for
the
welfare
of
your
souls
yea
mine
anxiety
is
great
for
you
and
ye
yourselves
know
that
it
ever
has
been
for
i
have
exhorted
you
with
all
diligence
and
i
have
taught
you
the
words
of
my
father
and
i
have
spoken
unto
you
concerning
all
things
which
are
written
from
the
creation
of
the
world

and
now
behold
i
would
speak
unto
you
concerning
things
which
are
and
which
are
to
come
wherefore
i
will
read
you
the
words
of
isaiah
and
they
are
the
words
which
my
brother
has
desired
that
i
should
speak
unto
you
and
i
speak
unto
you
for
your
sakes
that
ye
may
learn
and
glorify
the
name
of
your
god

and
now
the
words
which
i
shall
read
are
they
which
isaiah
spake
concerning
all
the
house
of
israel
wherefore
they
may
be
likened
unto
you
for
ye
are
of
the
house
of
israel
and
there
are
many
things
which
have
been
spoken
by
isaiah
which
may
be
likened
unto
you
because
ye
are
of
the
house
of
israel

and
now
these
are
the
words
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
i
will
lift
up
mine
hand
to
the
gentiles
and
set
up
my
standard
to
the
people
and
they
shall
bring
thy
sons
in
their
arms
and
thy
daughters
shall
be
carried
upon
their
shoulders

and
kings
shall
be
thy
nursing
fathers
and
their
queens
thy
nursing
mothers
they
shall
bow
down
to
thee
with
their
faces
towards
the
earth
and
lick
up
the
dust
of
thy
feet
and
thou
shalt
know
that
i
am
the
lord
for
they
shall
not
be
ashamed
that
wait
for
me

and
now
i
jacob
would
speak
somewhat
concerning
these
words
for
behold
the
lord
has
shown
me
that
those
who
were
at
jerusalem
from
whence
we
came
have
been
slain
and
carried
away
captive

nevertheless
the
lord
has
shown
unto
me
that
they
should
return
again
and
he
also
has
shown
unto
me
that
the
lord
god
the
holy
one
of
israel
should
manifest
himself
unto
them
in
the
flesh
and
after
he
should
manifest
himself
they
should
scourge
him
and
crucify
him
according
to
the
words
of
the
angel
who
spake
it
unto
me

and
after
they
have
hardened
their
hearts
and
stiffened
their
necks
against
the
holy
one
of
israel
behold
the
judgments
of
the
holy
one
of
israel
shall
come
upon
them
and
the
day
cometh
that
they
shall
be
smitten
and
afflicted

wherefore
after
they
are
driven
to
and
fro
for
thus
saith
the
angel
many
shall
be
afflicted
in
the
flesh
and
shall
not
be
suffered
to
perish
because
of
the
prayers
of
the
faithful
they
shall
be
scattered
and
smitten
and
hated
nevertheless
the
lord
will
be
merciful
unto
them
that
when
they
shall
come
to
the
knowledge
of
their
redeemer
they
shall
be
gathered
together
again
to
the
lands
of
their
inheritance

and
blessed
are
the
gentiles
they
of
whom
the
prophet
has
written
for
behold
if
it
so
be
that
they
shall
repent
and
fight
not
against
zion
and
do
not
unite
themselves
to
that
great
and
abominable
church
they
shall
be
saved
for
the
lord
god
will
fulfil
his
covenants
which
he
has
made
unto
his
children
and
for
this
cause
the
prophet
has
written
these
things

wherefore
they
that
fight
against
zion
and
the
covenant
people
of
the
lord
shall
lick
up
the
dust
of
their
feet
and
the
people
of
the
lord
shall
not
be
ashamed
for
the
people
of
the
lord
are
they
who
wait
for
him
for
they
still
wait
for
the
coming
of
the
messiah

and
behold
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophet
the
messiah
will
set
himself
again
the
second
time
to
recover
them
wherefore
he
will
manifest
himself
unto
them
in
power
and
great
glory
unto
the
destruction
of
their
enemies
when
that
day
cometh
when
they
shall
believe
in
him
and
none
will
he
destroy
that
believe
in
him

and
they
that
believe
not
in
him
shall
be
destroyed
both
by
fire
and
by
tempest
and
by
earthquakes
and
by
bloodsheds
and
by
pestilence
and
by
famine
and
they
shall
know
that
the
lord
is
god
the
holy
one
of
israel

for
shall
the
prey
be
taken
from
the
mighty
or
the
lawful
captive
delivered

but
thus
saith
the
lord
even
the
captives
of
the
mighty
shall
be
taken
away
and
the
prey
of
the
terrible
shall
be
delivered
for
the
mighty
god
shall
deliver
his
covenant
people
for
thus
saith
the
lord
i
will
contend
with
them
that
contendeth
with
thee

and
i
will
feed
them
that
oppress
thee
with
their
own
flesh
and
they
shall
be
drunken
with
their
own
blood
as
with
sweet

and
all

shall
know
that
i
the

am
thy

and
thy

the
lord
god
shall
bestow
upon
your
children

for
i
know
that
ye
have
searched
much
many
of
you
to
know
of
things
to
come
wherefore
i
know
that
ye
know
that
our
flesh
must
waste
away
and
die
nevertheless
in
our
bodies
we
shall
see
god

yea
i
know
that
ye
know
that
in
the
body
he
shall
show
himself
unto
those
at
jerusalem
from
whence
we
came
for
it
is
expedient
that
it
should
be
among
them
for
it
behooveth
the
great
creator
that
he
suffereth
himself
to
become
subject
unto
man
in
the
flesh
and
die
for
all
men
that
all
men
might
become
subject
unto
him

for
as
death
hath
passed
upon
all
men
to
fulfil
the
merciful
plan
of
the
great
creator
there
must
needs
be
a
power
of
resurrection
and
the
resurrection
must
needs
come
unto
man
by
reason
of
the
fall
and
the
fall
came
by
reason
of
transgression
and
because
man
became
fallen
they
were
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord

wherefore
it
must
needs
be
an
infinite
atonementsave
it
should
be
an
infinite
atonement
this
corruption
could
not
put
on
incorruption
wherefore
the
first
judgment
which
came
upon
man
must
needs
have
remained
to
an
endless
duration
and
if
so
this
flesh
must
have
laid
down
to
rot
and
to
crumble
to
its
mother
earth
to
rise
no
more

o
the
wisdom
of
god
his
mercy
and
grace
for
behold
if
the
flesh
should
rise
no
more
our
spirits
must
become
subject
to
that
angel
who
fell
from
before
the
presence
of
the
eternal
god
and
became
the
devil
to
rise
no
more

and
our
spirits
must
have
become
like
unto
him
and
we
become
devils
angels
to
a
devil
to
be
shut
out
from
the
presence
of
our
god
and
to
remain
with
the
father
of
lies
in
misery
like
unto
himself
yea
to
that
being
who
beguiled
our
first
parents
who
transformeth
himself
nigh
unto
an
angel
of
light
and
stirreth
up
the
children
of
men
unto
secret
combinations
of
murder
and
all
manner
of
secret
works
of
darkness

o
how
great
the
goodness
of
our
god
who
prepareth
a
way
for
our
escape
from
the
grasp
of
this
awful
monster
yea
that
monster
death
and
hell
which
i
call
the
death
of
the
body
and
also
the
death
of
the
spirit

and
because
of
the
way
of
deliverance
of
our
god
the
holy
one
of
israel
this
death
of
which
i
have
spoken
which
is
the
temporal
shall
deliver
up
its
dead
which
death
is
the
grave

and
this
death
of
which
i
have
spoken
which
is
the
spiritual
death
shall
deliver
up
its
dead
which
spiritual
death
is
hell
wherefore
death
and
hell
must
deliver
up
their
dead
and
hell
must
deliver
up
its
captive
spirits
and
the
grave
must
deliver
up
its
captive
bodies
and
the
bodies
and
the
spirits
of
men
will
be
restored
one
to
the
other
and
it
is
by
the
power
of
the
resurrection
of
the
holy
one
of
israel

o
how
great
the
plan
of
our
god
for
on
the
other
hand
the
paradise
of
god
must
deliver
up
the
spirits
of
the
righteous
and
the
grave
deliver
up
the
body
of
the
righteous
and
the
spirit
and
the
body
is
restored
to
itself
again
and
all
men
become
incorruptible
and
immortal
and
they
are
living
souls
having
a
perfect
knowledge
like
unto
us
in
the
flesh
save
it
be
that
our
knowledge
shall
be
perfect

wherefore
we
shall
have
a
perfect
knowledge
of
all
our
guilt
and
our
uncleanness
and
our
nakedness
and
the
righteous
shall
have
a
perfect
knowledge
of
their
enjoyment
and
their
righteousness
being
clothed
with
purity
yea
even
with
the
robe
of
righteousness

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
all
men
shall
have
passed
from
this
first
death
unto
life
insomuch
as
they
have
become
immortal
they
must
appear
before
the
judgmentseat
of
the
holy
one
of
israel
and
then
cometh
the
judgment
and
then
must
they
be
judged
according
to
the
holy
judgment
of
god

and
assuredly
as
the
lord
liveth
for
the
lord
god
hath
spoken
it
and
it
is
his
eternal
word
which
cannot
pass
away
that
they
who
are
righteous
shall
be
righteous
still
and
they
who
are
filthy
shall
be
filthy
still
wherefore
they
who
are
filthy
are
the
devil
and
his
angels
and
they
shall
go
away
into
everlasting
fire
prepared
for
them
and
their
torment
is
as
a
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
whose
flame
ascendeth
up
forever
and
ever
and
has
no
end

o
the
greatness
and
the
justice
of
our
god
for
he
executeth
all
his
words
and
they
have
gone
forth
out
of
his
mouth
and
his
law
must
be
fulfilled

but
behold
the
righteous
the
saints
of
the
holy
one
of
israel
they
who
have
believed
in
the
holy
one
of
israel
they
who
have
endured
the
crosses
of
the
world
and
despised
the
shame
of
it
they
shall
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
which
was
prepared
for
them
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
and
their
joy
shall
be
full
forever

o
the
greatness
of
the
mercy
of
our
god
the
holy
one
of
israel
for
he
delivereth
his
saints
from
that
awful
monster
the
devil
and
death
and
hell
and
that
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
which
is
endless
torment

o
how
great
the
holiness
of
our
god
for
he
knoweth
all
things
and
there
is
not
anything
save
he
knows
it

and
he
cometh
into
the
world
that
he
may
save
all
men
if
they
will
hearken
unto
his
voice
for
behold
he
suffereth
the
pains
of
all
men
yea
the
pains
of
every
living
creature
both
men
women
and
children
who
belong
to
the
family
of
adam

and
he
suffereth
this
that
the
resurrection
might
pass
upon
all
men
that
all
might
stand
before
him
at
the
great
and
judgment
day

and
he
commandeth
all
men
that
they
must
repent
and
be
baptized
in
his
name
having
perfect
faith
in
the
holy
one
of
israel
or
they
cannot
be
saved
in
the
kingdom
of
god

and
if
they
will
not
repent
and
believe
in
his
name
and
be
baptized
in
his
name
and
endure
to
the
end
they
must
be
damned
for
the
lord
god
the
holy
one
of
israel
has
spoken
it

wherefore
he
has
given
a
law
and
where
there
is
no
law
given
there
is
no
punishment
and
where
there
is
no
punishment
there
is
no
condemnation
and
where
there
is
no
condemnation
the
mercies
of
the
holy
one
of
israel
have
claim
upon
them
because
of
the
atonement
for
they
are
delivered
by
the
power
of
him

for
the
atonement
satisfieth
the
demands
of
his
justice
upon
all
those
who
have
not
the
law
given
to
them
that
they
are
delivered
from
that
awful
monster
death
and
hell
and
the
devil
and
the
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
which
is
endless
torment
and
they
are
restored
to
that
god
who
gave
them
breath
which
is
the
holy
one
of
israel

but
wo
unto
him
that
has
the
law
given
yea
that
has
all
the
commandments
of
god
like
unto
us
and
that
transgresseth
them
and
that
wasteth
the
days
of
his
probation
for
awful
is
his
state

o
that
cunning
plan
of
the
evil
one
o
the
vainness
and
the
frailties
and
the
foolishness
of
men
when
they
are
learned
they
think
they
are
wise
and
they
hearken
not
unto
the
counsel
of
god
for
they
set
it
aside
supposing
they
know
of
themselves
wherefore
their
wisdom
is
foolishness
and
it
profiteth
them
not
and
they
shall
perish

but
to
be
learned
is
good
if
they
hearken
unto
the
counsels
of
god

but
wo
unto
the
rich
who
are
rich
as
to
the
things
of
the
world
for
because
they
are
rich
they
despise
the
poor
and
they
persecute
the
meek
and
their
hearts
are
upon
their
treasures
wherefore
their
treasure
is
their
god
and
behold
their
treasure
shall
perish
with
them
also

and
wo
unto
the
deaf
that
will
not
hear
for
they
shall
perish

wo
unto
the
blind
that
will
not
see
for
they
shall
perish
also

wo
unto
the
uncircumcised
of
heart
for
a
knowledge
of
their
iniquities
shall
smite
them
at
the
last
day

wo
unto
the
liar
for
he
shall
be
thrust
down
to
hell

wo
unto
the
murderer
who
deliberately
killeth
for
he
shall
die

wo
unto
them
who
commit
whoredoms
for
they
shall
be
thrust
down
to
hell

yea
wo
unto
those
that
worship
idols
for
the
devil
of
all
devils
delighteth
in
them

and
in
fine
wo
unto
all
those
who
die
in
their
sins
for
they
shall
return
to
god
and
behold
his
face
and
remain
in
their
sins

o
my
beloved
brethren
remember
the
awfulness
in
transgressing
against
that
holy
god
and
also
the
awfulness
of
yielding
to
the
enticings
of
that
cunning
one
remember
to
be
carnallyminded
is
death
and
to
be
spirituallyminded
is
life
eternal

o
my
beloved
brethren
give
ear
to
my
words
remember
the
greatness
of
the
holy
one
of
israel
do
not
say
that
i
have
spoken
hard
things
against
you
for
if
ye
do
ye
will
revile
against
the
truth
for
i
have
spoken
the
words
of
your
maker
i
know
that
the
words
of
truth
are
hard
against
all
uncleanness
but
the
righteous
fear
them
not
for
they
love
the
truth
and
are
not
shaken

o
then
my
beloved
brethren
come
unto
the
lord
the
holy
one
remember
that
his
paths
are
righteous
behold
the
way
for
man
is
narrow
but
it
lieth
in
a
straight
course
before
him
and
the
keeper
of
the
gate
is
the
holy
one
of
israel
and
he
employeth
no
servant
there
and
there
is
none
other
way
save
it
be
by
the
gate
for
he
cannot
be
deceived
for
the
lord
god
is
his
name

and
whoso
knocketh
to
him
will
he
open
and
the
wise
and
the
learned
and
they
that
are
rich
who
are
puffed
up
because
of
their
learning
and
their
wisdom
and
their
richesyea
they
are
they
whom
he
despiseth
and
save
they
shall
cast
these
things
away
and
consider
themselves
fools
before
god
and
come
down
in
the
depths
of
humility
he
will
not
open
unto
them

but
the
things
of
the
wise
and
the
prudent
shall
be
hid
from
them
foreveryea
that
happiness
which
is
prepared
for
the
saints

o
my
beloved
brethren
remember
my
words
behold
i
take
off
my
garments
and
i
shake
them
before
you
i
pray
the
god
of
my
salvation
that
he
view
me
with
his
allsearching
eye
wherefore
ye
shall
know
at
the
last
day
when
all
men
shall
be
judged
of
their
works
that
the
god
of
israel
did
witness
that
i
shook
your
iniquities
from
my
soul
and
that
i
stand
with
brightness
before
him
and
am
rid
of
your
blood

o
my
beloved
brethren
turn
away
from
your
sins
shake
off
the
chains
of
him
that
would
bind
you
fast
come
unto
that
god
who
is
the
rock
of
your
salvation

prepare
your
souls
for
that
glorious
day
when
justice
shall
be
administered
unto
the
righteous
even
the
day
of
judgment
that
ye
may
not
shrink
with
awful
fear
that
ye
may
not
remember
your
awful
guilt
in
perfectness
and
be
constrained
to
exclaim
holy
holy
are
thy
judgments
o
lord
god
almightybut
i
know
my
guilt
i
transgressed
thy
law
and
my
transgressions
are
mine
and
the
devil
hath
obtained
me
that
i
am
a
prey
to
his
awful
misery

but
behold
my
brethren
is
it
expedient
that
i
should
awake
you
to
an
awful
reality
of
these
things
would
i
harrow
up
your
souls
if
your
minds
were
pure
would
i
be
plain
unto
you
according
to
the
plainness
of
the
truth
if
ye
were
freed
from
sin

behold
if
ye
were
holy
i
would
speak
unto
you
of
holiness
but
as
ye
are
not
holy
and
ye
look
upon
me
as
a
teacher
it
must
needs
be
expedient
that
i
teach
you
the
consequences
of
sin

behold
my
soul
abhorreth
sin
and
my
heart
delighteth
in
righteousness
and
i
will
praise
the
holy
name
of
my
god

come
my
brethren
every
one
that
thirsteth
come
ye
to
the
waters
and
he
that
hath
no
money
come
buy
and
eat
yea
come
buy
wine
and
milk
without
money
and
without
price

wherefore
do
not
spend
money
for
that
which
is
of
no
worth
nor
your
labor
for
that
which
cannot
satisfy
hearken
diligently
unto
me
and
remember
the
words
which
i
have
spoken
and
come
unto
the
holy
one
of
israel
and
feast
upon
that
which
perisheth
not
neither
can
be
corrupted
and
let
your
soul
delight
in
fatness

behold
my
beloved
brethren
remember
the
words
of
your
god
pray
unto
him
continually
by
day
and
give
thanks
unto
his
holy
name
by
night
let
your
hearts
rejoice

and
behold
how
great
the
covenants
of
the
lord
and
how
great
his
condescensions
unto
the
children
of
men
and
because
of
his
greatness
and
his
grace
and
mercy
he
has
promised
unto
us
that
our
seed
shall
not
utterly
be
destroyed
according
to
the
flesh
but
that
he
would
preserve
them
and
in
future
generations
they
shall
become
a
righteous
branch
unto
the
house
of
israel

and
now
my
brethren
i
would
speak
unto
you
more
but
on
the
morrow
i
will
declare
unto
you
the
remainder
of
my
words
amen

nephi
chapter


and
now
i
jacob
speak
unto
you
again
my
beloved
brethren
concerning
this
righteous
branch
of
which
i
have
spoken

for
behold
the
promises
which
we
have
obtained
are
promises
unto
us
according
to
the
flesh
wherefore
as
it
has
been
shown
unto
me
that
many
of
our
children
shall
perish
in
the
flesh
because
of
unbelief
nevertheless
god
will
be
merciful
unto
many
and
our
children
shall
be
restored
that
they
may
come
to
that
which
will
give
them
the
true
knowledge
of
their
redeemer

wherefore
as
i
said
unto
you
it
must
needs
be
expedient
that
christfor
in
the
last
night
the
angel
spake
unto
me
that
this
should
be
his
nameshould
come
among
the
jews
among
those
who
are
the
more
wicked
part
of
the
world
and
they
shall
crucify
himfor
thus
it
behooveth
our
god
and
there
is
none
other
nation
on
earth
that
would
crucify
their
god

for
should
the
mighty
miracles
be
wrought
among
other
nations
they
would
repent
and
know
that
he
be
their
god

but
because
of
priestcrafts
and
iniquities
they
at
jerusalem
will
stiffen
their
necks
against
him
that
he
be
crucified

wherefore
because
of
their
iniquities
destructions
famines
pestilences
and
bloodshed
shall
come
upon
them
and
they
who
shall
not
be
destroyed
shall
be
scattered
among
all
nations

but
behold
thus
saith
the
lord
god
when
the
day
cometh
that
they
shall
believe
in
me
that
i
am
christ
then
have
i
covenanted
with
their
fathers
that
they
shall
be
restored
in
the
flesh
upon
the
earth
unto
the
lands
of
their
inheritance

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
they
shall
be
gathered
in
from
their
long
dispersion
from
the
isles
of
the
sea
and
from
the
four
parts
of
the
earth
and
the
nations
of
the
gentiles
shall
be
great
in
the
eyes
of
me
saith
god
in
carrying
them
forth
to
the
lands
of
their
inheritance

yea
the
kings
of
the
gentiles
shall
be
nursing
fathers
unto
them
and
their
queens
shall
become
nursing
mothers
wherefore
the
promises
of
the
lord
are
great
unto
the
gentiles
for
he
hath
spoken
it
and
who
can
dispute

but
behold
this
land
said
god
shall
be
a
land
of
thine
inheritance
and
the
gentiles
shall
be
blessed
upon
the
land

and
this
land
shall
be
a
land
of
liberty
unto
the
gentiles
and
there
shall
be
no
kings
upon
the
land
who
shall
raise
up
unto
the
gentiles

and
i
will
fortify
this
land
against
all
other
nations

and
he
that
fighteth
against
zion
shall
perish
saith
god

for
he
that
raiseth
up
a
king
against
me
shall
perish
for
i
the
lord
the
king
of
heaven
will
be
their
king
and
i
will
be
a
light
unto
them
forever
that
hear
my
words

wherefore
for
this
cause
that
my
covenants
may
be
fulfilled
which
i
have
made
unto
the
children
of
men
that
i
will
do
unto
them
while
they
are
in
the
flesh
i
must
needs
destroy
the
secret
works
of
darkness
and
of
murders
and
of
abominations

wherefore
he
that
fighteth
against
zion
both
jew
and
gentile
both
bond
and
free
both
male
and
female
shall
perish
for
they
are
they
who
are
the
whore
of
all
the
earth
for
they
who
are
not
for
me
are
against
me
saith
our
god

for
i
will
fulfil
my
promises
which
i
have
made
unto
the
children
of
men
that
i
will
do
unto
them
while
they
are
in
the
flesh

wherefore
my
beloved
brethren
thus
saith
our
god
i
will
afflict
thy
seed
by
the
hand
of
the
gentiles
nevertheless
i
will
soften
the
hearts
of
the
gentiles
that
they
shall
be
like
unto
a
father
to
them
wherefore
the
gentiles
shall
be
blessed
and
numbered
among
the
house
of
israel

wherefore
i
will
consecrate
this
land
unto
thy
seed
and
them
who
shall
be
numbered
among
thy
seed
forever
for
the
land
of
their
inheritance
for
it
is
a
choice
land
saith
god
unto
me
above
all
other
lands
wherefore
i
will
have
all
men
that
dwell
thereon
that
they
shall
worship
me
saith
god

and
now
my
beloved
brethren
seeing
that
our
merciful
god
has
given
us
so
great
knowledge
concerning
these
things
let
us
remember
him
and
lay
aside
our
sins
and
not
hang
down
our
heads
for
we
are
not
cast
off
nevertheless
we
have
been
driven
out
of
the
land
of
our
inheritance
but
we
have
been
led
to
a
better
land
for
the
lord
has
made
the
sea
our
path
and
we
are
upon
an
isle
of
the
sea

but
great
are
the
promises
of
the
lord
unto
them
who
are
upon
the
isles
of
the
sea
wherefore
as
it
says
isles
there
must
needs
be
more
than
this
and
they
are
inhabited
also
by
our
brethren

for
behold
the
lord
god
has
led
away
from
time
to
time
from
the
house
of
israel
according
to
his
will
and
pleasure
and
now
behold
the
lord
remembereth
all
them
who
have
been
broken
off
wherefore
he
remembereth
us
also

therefore
cheer
up
your
hearts
and
remember
that
ye
are
free
to
act
for
yourselvesto
choose
the
way
of
everlasting
death
or
the
way
of
eternal
life

wherefore
my
beloved
brethren
reconcile
yourselves
to
the
will
of
god
and
not
to
the
will
of
the
devil
and
the
flesh
and
remember
after
ye
are
reconciled
unto
god
that
it
is
only
in
and
through
the
grace
of
god
that
ye
are
saved

wherefore
may
god
raise
you
from
death
by
the
power
of
the
resurrection
and
also
from
everlasting
death
by
the
power
of
the
atonement
that
ye
may
be
received
into
the
eternal
kingdom
of
god
that
ye
may
praise
him
through
grace

which

and
now
i
nephi

more
of
the

of
isaiah
for
my

delighteth
in
his
words
for
i
will
liken
his
words
unto
my

and
i
will
send
them
forth
unto
all
my

for
he
verily
saw
my
redeemer
even
as
i
have
seen
him

and
my

jacob
also
has
seen
him
as
i

seen
him
wherefore
i
will
send
their

forth
unto
my

to
prove
unto

that
my

are
true
wherefore
by
the

of
three
god
hath
said
i
will
establish
my

nevertheless
god
sendeth
more
witnesses
and
he
proveth
all
his

behold
my
soul
delighteth
in
proving
unto
my
people
the
truth
of
the
coming
of
christ
for
for
this
end
hath
the
law
of
moses
been
given
and
all
things
which
have
been
given
of
god
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
unto
man
are
the
typifying
of
him

and
also
my
soul
delighteth
in
the
covenants
of
the

which
he
hath
made
to
our

yea
my

delighteth
in
his

and
in
his
justice
and
power
and
mercy
in
the
great

eternal

of
deliverance
from

and
my

delighteth
in
proving
unto
my
people
that
save
christ
should
come
all
men
must
perish

for
if
there
be
no
christ
there
be
no

and
if
there
be
no

we

there
could

there

he
is
christ
and
he
cometh

jerusalem

because
their

have
been
against

to
provoke
the

the

declare
their

the

with

my

a

in
a
very
fruitful
hill

and
he
fenced
it
and
gathered
out
the
stones
thereof
and
planted
it
with
the
choicest
vine
and
built
a
tower
in
the
midst
of
it
and
also
made
a
winepress
therein
and
he
looked
that
it
should
bring
forth
grapes
and
it
brought
forth
wild
grapes

and

what

it

tell
you
what

do
to
my

will
take
away
the

thereof

it
shall
be
eaten
up

i
will
break
down
the

thereof
and
it
shall
be
trodden
down

and
i
will
lay
it
waste
it
shall
not
be
pruned
nor
digged
but
there
shall
come
up
briers
and

i
will
also
command
the

that
they
rain
no
rain
upon

for
the
vineyard
of

the

the

his

looked

for

behold
a

wo
unto

that
join
house
to

till
there
can
be
no
place
that
they
may
be
placed
alone
in
the

in

said
the

of

many
houses
shall
be
desolate
and
great

fair
cities
without
inhabitant

yea
ten
acres
of
vineyard
shall
yield
one
bath
and
the
seed
of
a
homer
shall
yield
an
ephah

wo
unto
them
that
rise
up
early
in
the
morning
that
they
may
follow
strong
drink
that
continue
until
night
and
wine
inflame
them

and
the

the

they
regard

my

because
they
have
no
knowledge
and
their
honorable
men
are
famished
and
their
multitude
dried
up
with
thirst

therefore
hell
hath
enlarged
herself
and
opened
her
mouth
without
measure
and
their
glory
and
their
multitude
and
their
pomp
and
he
that
rejoiceth
shall
descend
into
it

and
the
mean
man
shall
be
brought
down
and
the
mighty
man
shall
be
humbled
and
the
eyes
of
the
lofty
shall
be
humbled

but
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
be
exalted
in
judgment
and
god
that
is
holy
shall
be
sanctified
in
righteousness

then
shall
the
lambs
feed
after
their
manner
and
the
waste
places
of
the
fat
ones
shall
strangers
eat

wo
unto
them
that
draw
iniquity
with
cords
of
vanity
and
sin
as
it
were
with
a
cart
rope

that
say
let
him
make
speed
hasten
his
work
that
we
may
see
it
and
let
the
counsel
of
the
holy
one
of
israel
draw
nigh
and
come
that
we
may
know
it

wo
unto
them
that
call
evil
good
and
good
evil
that
put
darkness
for
light
and
light
for
darkness
that
put
bitter
for
sweet
and
sweet
for
bitter

wo
unto
the
wise
in
their
own
eyes
and
prudent
in
their
own
sight

wo
unto
the
mighty
to
drink
wine
and
men
of
strength
to
mingle
strong
drink

who
justify
the
wicked
for
reward
and
take
away
the
righteousness
of
the
righteous
from
him

therefore
as
the
fire
devoureth
the
stubble
and
the
flame
consumeth
the
chaff
their
root
shall
be
rottenness
and
their
blossoms
shall
go
up
as
dust
because
they
have
cast
away
the
law
of
the
lord
of
hosts
and
despised
the
word
of
the
holy
one
of
israel

therefore
is
the
anger
of
the
lord
kindled
against
his
people
and
he
hath
stretched
forth
his
hand
against
them
and
hath
smitten
them
and
the
hills
did
tremble
and
their
carcasses
were
torn
in
the
midst
of
the
streets
for
all
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away
but
his
hand
is
stretched
out
still

and
he
will
lift
up
an
ensign
to
the
nations
from
far
and
will
hiss
unto
them
from
the
end
of
the
earth
and
behold
they
shall
come
with
speed
swiftly
none
shall
be
weary
nor
stumble
among
them

none
shall
slumber
nor
sleep
neither
shall
the
girdle
of
their
loins
be
loosed
nor
the
latchet
of
their
shoes
be
broken

whose
arrows
shall
be
sharp
and
all
their
bows
bent
and
their
horses
hoofs
shall
be
counted
like
flint
and
their
wheels
like
a
whirlwind
their
roaring
like
a
lion

they
shall
roar
like
young
lions
yea
they
shall
roar
and
lay
hold
of
the
prey
and
shall
carry
away
safe
and
none
shall
deliver

and
in
that
day
they
shall
roar
against
them
like
the
roaring
of
the
sea
and
if
they
look
unto
the
land
behold
darkness
and
sorrow
and
the
light
is
darkened
in
the
heavens
thereof

nephi
chapter


in
the
year
that
king
uzziah
died
i
saw
also
the
lord
sitting
upon
a
throne
high
and
lifted
up
and
his
train
filled
the
temple

above
it
stood
the
seraphim
each
one
had
six
wings
with
twain
he
covered
his
face
and
with
twain
he
covered
his
feet
and
with
twain
he
did
fly

and
one
cried
unto
another
and
said
holy
holy
holy
is
the
lord
of
hosts
the
whole
earth
is
full
of
his
glory

and
the
posts
of
the
door
moved
at
the
voice
of
him
that
cried
and
the
house
was
filled
with
smoke

then
said
i
wo
is
unto
me
for
i
am
undone
because
i
am
a
man
of
unclean
lips
and
i
dwell
in
the
midst
of
a
people
of
unclean
lips
for
mine
eyes
have
seen
the
king
the
lord
of
hosts

then
flew
one
of
the
seraphim
unto
me
having
a
live
coal
in
his
hand
which
he
had
taken
with
the
tongs
from
off
the
altar

and
he
laid
it
upon
my
mouth
and
said
lo
this
has
touched
thy
lips
and
thine
iniquity
is
taken
away
and
thy
sin
purged

also
i
heard
the
voice
of
the
lord
saying
whom
shall
i
send
and
who
will
go
for
us
then
i
said
here
am
i
send
me

and
he
said
go
and
tell
this
peoplehear
ye
indeed
but
they
understood
not
and
see
ye
indeed
but
they
perceived
not

make
the
heart
of
this
people
fat
and
make
their
ears
heavy
and
shut
their
eyeslest
they
see
with
their
eyes
and
hear
with
their
ears
and
understand
with
their
heart
and
be
converted
and
be
healed

then
said
i
lord
how
long
and
he
said
until
the
cities
be
wasted
without
inhabitant
and
the
houses
without
man
and
the
land
be
utterly
desolate

and
the
lord
have
removed
men
far
away
for
there
shall
be
a
great
forsaking
in
the
midst
of
the
land

but
yet
there
shall
be
a
tenth
and
they
shall
return
and
shall
be
eaten
as
a
teiltree
and
as
an
oak
whose
substance
is
in
them
when
they
cast
their
leaves
so
the
holy
seed
shall
be
the
substance
thereof

nephi
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
ahaz
the
son
of
jotham
the
son
of
uzziah
king
of
judah
that
rezin
king
of
syria
and
pekah
the
son
of
remaliah
king
of
israel
went
up
toward
jerusalem
to
war
against
it
but
could
not
prevail
against
it

and
it
was
told
the
house
of
david
saying
syria
is
confederate
with
ephraim
and
his
heart
was
moved
and
the
heart
of
his
people
as
the
trees
of
the
wood
are
moved
with
the
wind

then
said
the
lord
unto
isaiah
go
forth
now
to
meet
ahaz
thou
and
shearjashub
thy
son
at
the
end
of
the
conduit
of
the
upper
pool
in
the
highway
of
the
fullers
field

and
say
unto
him
take
heed
and
be
quiet
fear
not
neither
be
fainthearted
for
the
two
tails
of
these
smoking
firebrands
for
the
fierce
anger
of
rezin
with
syria
and
of
the
son
of
remaliah

because
syria
ephraim
and
the
son
of
remaliah
have
taken
evil
counsel
against
thee
saying

let
us
go
up
against
judah
and
vex
it
and
let
us
make
a
breach
therein
for
us
and
set
a
king
in
the
midst
of
it
yea
the
son
of
tabeal

thus
saith
the
lord
god
it
shall
not
stand
neither
shall
it
come
to
pass

for
the
head
of
syria
is
damascus
and
the
head
of
damascus
rezin
and
within
three
score
and
five
years
shall
ephraim
be
broken
that
it
be
not
a
people

and
the
head
of
ephraim
is
samaria
and
the
head
of
samaria
is
remaliahs
son
if
ye
will
not
believe
surely
ye
shall
not
be
established

moreover
the
lord
spake
again
unto
ahaz
saying

ask
thee
a
sign
of
the
lord
thy
god
ask
it
either
in
the
depths
or
in
the
heights
above

but
ahaz
said
i
will
not
ask
neither
will
i
tempt
the
lord

and
he
said
hear
ye
now
o
house
of
david
is
it
a
small
thing
for
you
to
weary
men
but
will
ye
weary
my
god
also

therefore
the
lord
himself
shall
give
you
a
signbehold
a
virgin
shall
conceive
and
shall
bear
a
son
and
shall
call
his
name
immanuel

butter
and
honey
shall
he
eat
that
he
may
know
to
refuse
the
evil
and
to
choose
the
good

for
before
the
child
shall
know
to
refuse
the
evil
and
choose
the
good
the
land
that
thou
abhorrest
shall
be
forsaken
of
both
her
kings

the
lord
shall
bring
upon
thee
and
upon
thy
people
and
upon
thy
fathers
house
days
that
have
not
come
from
the
day
that
ephraim
departed
from
judah
the
king
of
assyria

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
the
lord
shall
hiss
for
the
fly
that
is
in
the
uttermost
part
of
egypt
and
for
the
bee
that
is
in
the
land
of
assyria

and
they
shall
come
and
shall
rest
all
of
them
in
the
desolate
valleys
and
in
the
holes
of
the
rocks
and
upon
all
thorns
and
upon
all
bushes

in
the
same
day
shall
the
lord
shave
with
a
razor
that
is
hired
by
them
beyond
the
river
by
the
king
of
assyria
the
head
and
the
hair
of
the
feet
and
it
shall
also
consume
the
beard

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
a
man
shall
nourish
a
young
cow
and
two
sheep

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
for
the
abundance
of
milk
they
shall
give
he
shall
eat
butter
for
butter
and
honey
shall
every
one
eat
that
is
left
in
the
land

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
every
place
shall
be
where
there
were
a
thousand
vines
at
a
thousand
silverlings
which
shall
be
for
briers
and
thorns

with
arrows
and
with
bows
shall
men
come
thither
because
all
the
land
shall
become
briers
and
thorns

and
all
hills
that
shall
be
digged
with
the
mattock
there
shall
not
come
thither
the
fear
of
briers
and
thorns
but
it
shall
be
for
the
sending
forth
of
oxen
and
the
treading
of
lesser
cattle

nephi
chapter


moreover
the
word
of
the
lord
said
unto
me
take
thee
a
great
roll
and
write
in
it
with
a
mans
pen
concerning
mahershalalhashbaz

and
i
took
unto
me
faithful
witnesses
to
record
uriah
the
priest
and
zechariah
the
son
of
jeberechiah

and
i
went
unto
the
prophetess
and
she
conceived
and
bare
a
son
then
said
the
lord
to
me
call
his
name
mahershalalhashbaz

for
behold
the
child
shall
not
have
knowledge
to
cry
my
father
and
my
mother
before
the
riches
of
damascus
and
the
spoil
of
samaria
shall
be
taken
away
before
the
king
of
assyria

the
lord
spake
also
unto
me
again
saying

forasmuch
as
this
people
refuseth
the
waters
of
shiloah
that
go
softly
and
rejoice
in
rezin
and
remaliahs
son

now
therefore
behold
the
lord
bringeth
up
upon
them
the
waters
of
the
river
strong
and
many
even
the
king
of
assyria
and
all
his
glory
and
he
shall
come
up
over
all
his
channels
and
go
over
all
his
banks

and
he
shall
pass
through
judah
he
shall
overflow
and
go
over
he
shall
reach
even
to
the
neck
and
the
stretching
out
of
his
wings
shall
fill
the
breadth
of
thy
land
o
immanuel

associate
yourselves
o
ye
people
and
ye
shall
be
broken
in
pieces
and
give
ear
all
ye
of
far
countries
gird
yourselves
and
ye
shall
be
broken
in
pieces
gird
yourselves
and
ye
shall
be
broken
in
pieces

take
counsel
together
and
it
shall
come
to
naught
speak
the
word
and
it
shall
not
stand
for
god
is
with
us

for
the
lord
spake
thus
to
me
with
a
strong
hand
and
instructed
me
that
i
should
not
walk
in
the
way
of
this
people
saying

say
ye
not
a
confederacy
to
all
to
whom
this
people
shall
say
a
confederacy
neither
fear
ye
their
fear
nor
be
afraid

sanctify
the
lord
of
hosts
himself
and
let
him
be
your
fear
and
let
him
be
your
dread

and
he
shall
be
for
a
sanctuary
but
for
a
stone
of
stumbling
and
for
a
rock
of
offense
to
both
the
houses
of
israel
for
a
gin
and
a
snare
to
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem

and
many
among
them
shall
stumble
and
fall
and
be
broken
and
be
snared
and
be
taken

bind
up
the
testimony
seal
the
law
among
my
disciples

and
i
will
wait
upon
the
lord
that
hideth
his
face
from
the
house
of
jacob
and
i
will
look
for
him

behold
i
and
the
children
whom
the
lord
hath
given
me
are
for
signs
and
for
wonders
in
israel
from
the
lord
of
hosts
which
dwelleth
in
mount
zion

and
when
they
shall
say
unto
you
seek
unto
them
that
have
familiar
spirits
and
unto
wizards
that
peep
and
muttershould
not
a
people
seek
unto
their
god
for
the
living
to
hear
from
the
dead

to
the
law
and
to
the
testimony
and
if
they
speak
not
according
to
this
word
it
is
because
there
is
no
light
in
them

and
they
shall
pass
through
it
hardly
bestead
and
hungry
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
they
shall
be
hungry
they
shall
fret
themselves
and
curse
their
king
and
their
god
and
look
upward

and
they
shall
look
unto
the
earth
and
behold
trouble
and
darkness
dimness
of
anguish
and
shall
be
driven
to
darkness

nephi
chapter


nevertheless
the
dimness
shall
not
be
such
as
was
in
her
vexation
when
at
first
he
lightly
afflicted
the
land
of
zebulun
and
the
land
of
naphtali
and
afterwards
did
more
grievously
afflict
by
the
way
of
the
red
sea
beyond
jordan
in
galilee
of
the
nations

the
people
that
walked
in
darkness
have
seen
a
great
light
they
that
dwell
in
the
land
of
the
shadow
of
death
upon
them
hath
the
light
shined

thou
hast
multiplied
the
nation
and
increased
the
joythey
joy
before
thee
according
to
the
joy
in
harvest
and
as
men
rejoice
when
they
divide
the
spoil

for
thou
hast
broken
the
yoke
of
his
burden
and
the
staff
of
his
shoulder
the
rod
of
his
oppressor

for
every
battle
of
the
warrior
is
with
confused
noise
and
garments
rolled
in
blood
but
this
shall
be
with
burning
and
fuel
of
fire

for
unto
us
a
child
is
born
unto
us
a
son
is
given
and
the
government
shall
be
upon
his
shoulder
and
his
name
shall
be
called
wonderful
counselor
the
mighty
god
the
everlasting
father
the
prince
of
peace

of
the
increase
of
government
and
peace
there
is
no
end
upon
the
throne
of
david
and
upon
his
kingdom
to
order
it
and
to
establish
it
with
judgment
and
with
justice
from
henceforth
even
forever
the
zeal
of
the
lord
of
hosts
will
perform
this

the
lord
sent
his
word
unto
jacob
and
it
hath
lighted
upon
israel

and
all
the
people
shall
know
even
ephraim
and
the
inhabitants
of
samaria
that
say
in
the
pride
and
stoutness
of
heart

the
bricks
are
fallen
down
but
we
will
build
with
hewn
stones
the
sycamores
are
cut
down
but
we
will
change
them
into
cedars

therefore
the
lord
shall
set
up
the
adversaries
of
rezin
against
him
and
join
his
enemies
together

the
syrians
before
and
the
philistines
behind
and
they
shall
devour
israel
with
open
mouth
for
all
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away
but
his
hand
is
stretched
out
still

for
the
people
turneth
not
unto
him
that
smiteth
them
neither
do
they
seek
the
lord
of
hosts

therefore
will
the
lord
cut
off
from
israel
head
and
tail
branch
and
rush
in
one
day

the
ancient
he
is
the
head
and
the
prophet
that
teacheth
lies
he
is
the
tail

for
the
leaders
of
this
people
cause
them
to
err
and
they
that
are
led
of
them
are
destroyed

therefore
the
lord
shall
have
no
joy
in
their
young
men
neither
shall
have
mercy
on
their
fatherless
and
widows
for
every
one
of
them
is
a
hypocrite
and
an
evildoer
and
every
mouth
speaketh
folly
for
all
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away
but
his
hand
is
stretched
out
still

for
wickedness
burneth
as
the
fire
it
shall
devour
the
briers
and
thorns
and
shall
kindle
in
the
thickets
of
the
forests
and
they
shall
mount
up
like
the
lifting
up
of
smoke

through
the
wrath
of
the
lord
of
hosts
is
the
land
darkened
and
the
people
shall
be
as
the
fuel
of
the
fire
no
man
shall
spare
his
brother

and
he
shall
snatch
on
the
right
hand
and
be
hungry
and
he
shall
eat
on
the
left
hand
and
they
shall
not
be
satisfied
they
shall
eat
every
man
the
flesh
of
his
own

wo
unto
them
that
decree
unrighteous
decrees
and
that
write
grievousness
which
they
have
prescribed

to
turn
away
the
needy
from
judgment
and
to
take
away
the
right
from
the
poor
of
my
people
that
widows
may
be
their
prey
and
that
they
may
rob
the
fatherless

and
what
will
ye
do
in
the
day
of
visitation
and
in
the
desolation
which
shall
come
from
far
to
whom
will
ye
flee
for
help
and
where
will
ye
leave
your
glory

without
me
they
shall
bow
down
under
the
prisoners
and
they
shall
fall
under
the
slain
for
all
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away
but
his
hand
is
stretched
out
still

o
assyrian
the
rod
of
mine
anger
and
the
staff
in
their
hand
is
their
indignation

i
will
send
him
against
a
hypocritical
nation
and
against
the
people
of
my
wrath
will
i
give
him
a
charge
to
take
the
spoil
and
to
take
the
prey
and
to
tread
them
down
like
the
mire
of
the
streets

howbeit
he
meaneth
not
so
neither
doth
his
heart
think
so
but
in
his
heart
it
is
to
destroy
and
cut
off
nations
not
a
few

for
he
saith
are
not
my
princes
altogether
kings

is
not
calno
as
carchemish
is
not
hamath
as
arpad
is
not
samaria
as
damascus

as
my
hand
hath
founded
the
kingdoms
of
the
idols
and
whose
graven
images
did
excel
them
of
jerusalem
and
of
samaria

shall
i
not
as
i
have
done
unto
samaria
and
her
idols
so
do
to
jerusalem
and
to
her
idols

wherefore
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
the
lord
hath
performed
his
whole
work
upon
mount
zion
and
upon
jerusalem
i
will
punish
the
fruit
of
the
stout
heart
of
the
king
of
assyria
and
the
glory
of
his
high
looks

for
he
saith
by
the
strength
of
my
hand
and
by
my
wisdom
i
have
done
these
things
for
i
am
prudent
and
i
have
moved
the
borders
of
the
people
and
have
robbed
their
treasures
and
i
have
put
down
the
inhabitants
like
a
valiant
man

and
my
hand
hath
found
as
a
nest
the
riches
of
the
people
and
as
one
gathereth
eggs
that
are
left
have
i
gathered
all
the
earth
and
there
was
none
that
moved
the
wing
or
opened
the
mouth
or
peeped

shall
the
ax
boast
itself
against
him
that
heweth
therewith
shall
the
saw
magnify
itself
against
him
that
shaketh
it
as
if
the
rod
should
shake
itself
against
them
that
lift
it
up
or
as
if
the
staff
should
lift
up
itself
as
if
it
were
no
wood

therefore
shall
the
lord
the
lord
of
hosts
send
among
his
fat
ones
leanness
and
under
his
glory
he
shall
kindle
a
burning
like
the
burning
of
a
fire

and
the
light
of
israel
shall
be
for
a
fire
and
his
holy
one
for
a
flame
and
shall
burn
and
shall
devour
his
thorns
and
his
briers
in
one
day

and
shall
consume
the
glory
of
his
forest
and
of
his
fruitful
field
both
soul
and
body
and
they
shall
be
as
when
a
standardbearer
fainteth

and
the
rest
of
the
trees
of
his
forest
shall
be
few
that
a
child
may
write
them

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
the
remnant
of
israel
and
such
as
are
escaped
of
the
house
of
jacob
shall
no
more
again
stay
upon
him
that
smote
them
but
shall
stay
upon
the
lord
the
holy
one
of
israel
in
truth

the
remnant
shall
return
yea
even
the
remnant
of
jacob
unto
the
mighty
god

for
though
thy
people
israel
be
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
yet
a
remnant
of
them
shall
return
the
consumption
decreed
shall
overflow
with
righteousness

for
the
lord
god
of
hosts
shall
make
a
consumption
even
determined
in
all
the
land

therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
o
my
people
that
dwellest
in
zion
be
not
afraid
of
the
assyrian
he
shall
smite
thee
with
a
rod
and
shall
lift
up
his
staff
against
thee
after
the
manner
of
egypt

for
yet
a
very
little
while
and
the
indignation
shall
cease
and
mine
anger
in
their
destruction

and
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
stir
up
a
scourge
for
him
according
to
the
slaughter
of
midian
at
the
rock
of
oreb
and
as
his
rod
was
upon
the
sea
so
shall
he
lift
it
up
after
the
manner
of
egypt

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
his

shall
be
taken
away
from

his

not
judge
after
the

of

neither
reprove
after

but
with
righteousness
shall
he
judge

reprove
with
equity
for
the
meek

and
he
shall
smite
the

with
the

of
his

with
the
breath
of
his

shall
he
slay
the

the

the

nephi
chapter


now
i
nephi
do
speak
somewhat
concerning
the
words
which
i
have
written
which
have
been
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
isaiah
for
behold
isaiah
spake
many
things
which
were
hard
for
many
of
my
people
to
understand
for
they
know
not
concerning
the
manner
of
prophesying
among
the
jews

for
i
nephi
have
not
taught
them
many
things
concerning
the
manner
of
the
jews
for
their
works
were
works
of
darkness
and
their
doings
were
doings
of
abominations

wherefore
i
write
unto
my
people
unto
all
those
that
shall
receive
hereafter
these
things
which
i
write
that
they
may
know
the
judgments
of
god
that
they
come
upon
all
nations
according
to
the
word
which
he
hath
spoken

wherefore
hearken
o
my
people
which
are
of
the
house
of
israel
and
give
ear
unto
my
words
for
because
the
words
of
isaiah
are
not
plain
unto
you
nevertheless
they
are
plain
unto
all
those
that
are
filled
with
the
spirit
of
prophecy
but
i
give
unto
you
a
prophecy
according
to
the
spirit
which
is
in
me
wherefore
i
shall
prophesy
according
to
the
plainness
which
hath
been
with
me
from
the
time
that
i
came
out
from
jerusalem
with
my
father
for
behold
my
soul
delighteth
in
plainness
unto
my
people
that
they
may
learn

yea
and
my
soul
delighteth
in
the
words
of
isaiah
for
i
came
out
from
jerusalem
and
mine
eyes
hath
beheld
the
things
of
the
jews
and
i
know
that
the
jews
do
understand
the
things
of
the
prophets
and
there
is
none
other
people
that
understand
the
things
which
were
spoken
unto
the
jews
like
unto
them
save
it
be
that
they
are
taught
after
the
manner
of
the
things
of
the
jews

but
behold
i
nephi
have
not
taught
my
children
after
the
manner
of
the
jews
but
behold
i
of
myself
have
dwelt
at
jerusalem
wherefore
i
know
concerning
the
regions
round
about
and
i
have
made
mention
unto
my
children
concerning
the
judgments
of
god
which
hath
come
to
pass
among
the
jews
unto
my
children
according
to
all
that
which
isaiah
hath
spoken
and
i
do
not
write
them

but
behold
i
proceed
with
mine
own
prophecy
according
to
my
plainness
in
the
which
i
know
that
no
man
can
err
nevertheless
in
the
days
that
the
prophecies
of
isaiah
shall
be
fulfilled
men
shall
know
of
a
surety
at
the
times
when
they
shall
come
to
pass

wherefore
they
are
of
worth
unto
the
children
of
men
and
he
that
supposeth
that
they
are
not
unto
them
will
i
speak
particularly
and
confine
the
words
unto
mine
own
people
for
i
know
that
they
shall
be
of
great
worth
unto
them
in
the
last
days
for
in
that
day
shall
they
understand
them
wherefore
for
their
good
have
i
written
them

and
as
one
generation
hath
been
destroyed
among
the
jews
because
of
iniquity
even
so
have
they
been
destroyed
from
generation
to
generation
according
to
their
iniquities
and
never
hath
any
of
them
been
destroyed
save
it
were
foretold
them
by
the
prophets
of
the
lord

wherefore
it
hath
been
told
them
concerning
the
destruction
which
should
come
upon
them
immediately
after
my
father
left
jerusalem
nevertheless
they
hardened
their
hearts
and
according
to
my
prophecy
they
have
been
destroyed
save
it
be
those
which
are
carried
away
captive
into
babylon

and
now
this
i
speak
because
of
the
spirit
which
is
in
me
and
notwithstanding
they
have
been
carried
away
they
shall
return
again
and
possess
the
land
of
jerusalem
wherefore
they
shall
be
restored
again
to
the
land
of
their
inheritance

but
behold
they
shall
have
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
and
when
the
day
cometh
that
the
only
begotten
of
the
father
yea
even
the
father
of
heaven
and
of
earth
shall
manifest
himself
unto
them
in
the
flesh
behold
they
will
reject
him
because
of
their
iniquities
and
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
the
stiffness
of
their
necks

behold
they
will
crucify
him
and
after
he
is
laid
in
a
sepulchre
for
the
space
of
three
days
he
shall
rise
from
the
dead
with
healing
in
his
wings
and
all
those
who
shall
believe
on
his
name
shall
be
saved
in
the
kingdom
of
god
wherefore
my
soul
delighteth
to
prophesy
concerning
him
for
i
have
seen
his
day
and
my
heart
doth
magnify
his
holy
name

and
behold
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
after
the
messiah
hath
risen
from
the
dead
and
hath
manifested
himself
unto
his
people
unto
as
many
as
will
believe
on
his
name
behold
jerusalem
shall
be
destroyed
again
for
wo
unto
them
that
fight
against
god
and
the
people
of
his
church

wherefore
the
jews
shall
be
scattered
among
all
nations
yea
and
also
babylon
shall
be
destroyed
wherefore
the
jews
shall
be
scattered
by
other
nations

and
after
they
have
been
scattered
and
the
lord
god
hath
scourged
them
by
other
nations
for
the
space
of
many
generations
yea
even
down
from
generation
to
generation
until
they
shall
be
persuaded
to
believe
in
christ
the
son
of
god
and
the
atonement
which
is
infinite
for
all
mankindand
when
that
day
shall
come
that
they
shall
believe
in
christ
and
worship
the
father
in
his
name
with
pure
hearts
and
clean
hands
and
look
not
forward
any
more
for
another
messiah
then
at
that
time
the
day
will
come
that
it
must
needs
be
expedient
that
they
should
believe
these
things

and
the
lord
will
set
his
hand
again
the
second
time
to
restore
his
people
from
their
lost
and
fallen
state
wherefore
he
will
proceed
to
do
a
marvelous
work
and
a
wonder
among
the
children
of
men

wherefore
he
shall
bring
forth
his
words
unto
them
which
words
shall
judge
them
at
the
last
day
for
they
shall
be
given
them
for
the
purpose
of
convincing
them
of
the
true
messiah
who
was
rejected
by
them
and
unto
the
convincing
of
them
that
they
need
not
look
forward
any
more
for
a
messiah
to
come
for
there
should
not
any
come
save
it
should
be
a
false
messiah
which
should
deceive
the
people
for
there
is
save
one
messiah
spoken
of
by
the
prophets
and
that
messiah
is
he
who
should
be
rejected
of
the
jews

for
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophets
the
messiah
cometh
in
six
hundred
years
from
the
time
that
my
father
left
jerusalem
and
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophets
and
also
the
word
of
the
angel
of
god
his
name
shall
be
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god

and
now
my
brethren
i
have
spoken
plainly
that
ye
cannot
err
and
as
the
lord
god
liveth
that
brought
israel
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
gave
unto
moses
power
that
he
should
heal
the
nations
after
they
had
been
bitten
by
the
poisonous
serpents
if
they
would
cast
their
eyes
unto
the
serpent
which
he
did
raise
up
before
them
and
also
gave
him
power
that
he
should
smite
the
rock
and
the
water
should
come
forth
yea
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
as
these
things
are
true
and
as
the
lord
god
liveth
there
is
none
other
name
given
under
heaven
save
it
be
this
jesus
christ
of
which
i
have
spoken
whereby
man
can
be
saved

wherefore
for
this
cause
hath
the
lord
god
promised
unto
me
that
these
things
which
i
write
shall
be
kept
and
preserved
and
handed
down
unto
my
seed
from
generation
to
generation
that
the
promise
may
be
fulfilled
unto
joseph
that
his
seed
should
never
perish
as
long
as
the
earth
should
stand

wherefore
these
things
shall
go
from
generation
to
generation
as
long
as
the
earth
shall
stand
and
they
shall
go
according
to
the
will
and
pleasure
of
god
and
the
nations
who
shall
possess
them
shall
be
judged
of
them
according
to
the
words
which
are
written

for
we
labor
diligently
to
write
to
persuade
our
children
and
also
our
brethren
to
believe
in
christ
and
to
be
reconciled
to
god
for
we
know
that
it
is
by
grace
that
we
are
saved
after
all
we
can
do

and
notwithstanding
we
believe
in
christ
we
keep
the
law
of
moses
and
look
forward
with
steadfastness
unto
christ
until
the
law
shall
be
fulfilled

for
for
this
end
was
the
law
given
wherefore
the
law
hath
become
dead
unto
us
and
we
are
made
alive
in
christ
because
of
our
faith
yet
we
keep
the
law
because
of
the
commandments

and
we
talk
of
christ
we
rejoice
in
christ
we
preach
of
christ
we
prophesy
of
christ
and
we
write
according
to
our
prophecies
that
our
children
may
know
to
what
source
they
may
look
for
a
remission
of
their
sins

wherefore
we
speak
concerning
the
law
that
our
children
may
know
the
deadness
of
the
law
and
they
by
knowing
the
deadness
of
the
law
may
look
forward
unto
that
life
which
is
in
christ
and
know
for
what
end
the
law
was
given
and
after
the
law
is
fulfilled
in
christ
that
they
need
not
harden
their
hearts
against
him
when
the
law
ought
to
be
done
away

and
now
behold
my
people
ye
are
a
stiffnecked
people
wherefore
i
have
spoken
plainly
unto
you
that
ye
cannot
misunderstand
and
the
words
which
i
have
spoken
shall
stand
as
a
testimony
against
you
for
they
are
sufficient
to
teach
any
man
the
right
way
for
the
right
way
is
to
believe
in
christ
and
deny
him
not
for
by
denying
him
ye
also
deny
the
prophets
and
the
law

and
now
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
the
right
way
is
to
believe
in
christ
and
deny
him
not
and
christ
is
the
holy
one
of
israel
wherefore
ye
must
bow
down
before
him
and
worship
him
with
all
your
might
mind
and
strength
and
your
whole
soul
and
if
ye
do
this
ye
shall
in
nowise
be
cast
out

and
inasmuch
as
it
shall
be
expedient
ye
must
keep
the
performances
and
ordinances
of
god
until
the
law
shall
be
fulfilled
which
was
given
unto
moses

nephi
chapter


and
after
christ
shall
have
risen
from
the
dead
he
shall
show
himself
unto
you
my
children
and
my
beloved
brethren
and
the
words
which
he
shall
speak
unto
you
shall
be
the
law
which
ye
shall
do

for
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
i
have
beheld
that
many
generations
shall
pass
away
and
there
shall
be
great
wars
and
contentions
among
my
people

and
after
the
messiah
shall
come
there
shall
be
signs
given
unto
my
people
of
his
birth
and
also
of
his
death
and
resurrection
and
great
and
terrible
shall
that
day
be
unto
the
wicked
for
they
shall
perish
and
they
perish
because
they
cast
out
the
prophets
and
the
saints
and
stone
them
and
slay
them
wherefore
the
cry
of
the
blood
of
the
saints
shall
ascend
up
to
god
from
the
ground
against
them

wherefore
all
those
who
are
proud
and
that
do
wickedly
the
day
that
cometh
shall
burn
them
up
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
for
they
shall
be
as
stubble

and
they
that
kill
the
prophets
and
the
saints
the
depths
of
the
earth
shall
swallow
them
up
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
and
mountains
shall
cover
them
and
whirlwinds
shall
carry
them
away
and
buildings
shall
fall
upon
them
and
crush
them
to
pieces
and
grind
them
to
powder

and
they
shall
be
visited
with
thunderings
and
lightnings
and
earthquakes
and
all
manner
of
destructions
for
the
fire
of
the
anger
of
the
lord
shall
be
kindled
against
them
and
they
shall
be
as
stubble
and
the
day
that
cometh
shall
consume
them
saith
the
lord
of
hosts

o
the
pain
and
the
anguish
of
my
soul
for
the
loss
of
the
slain
of
my
people
for
i
nephi
have
seen
it
and
it
well
nigh
consumeth
me
before
the
presence
of
the
lord
but
i
must
cry
unto
my
god
thy
ways
are
just

but
behold
the
righteous
that
hearken
unto
the
words
of
the
prophets
and
destroy
them
not
but
look
forward
unto
christ
with
steadfastness
for
the
signs
which
are
given
notwithstanding
all
persecutionbehold
they
are
they
which
shall
not
perish

but
the
son
of
righteousness
shall
appear
unto
them
and
he
shall
heal
them
and
they
shall
have
peace
with
him
until
three
generations
shall
have
passed
away
and
many
of
the
fourth
generation
shall
have
passed
away
in
righteousness

and
when
these
things
have
passed
away
a
speedy
destruction
cometh
unto
my
people
for
notwithstanding
the
pains
of
my
soul
i
have
seen
it
wherefore
i
know
that
it
shall
come
to
pass
and
they
sell
themselves
for
naught
for
for
the
reward
of
their
pride
and
their
foolishness
they
shall
reap
destruction
for
because
they
yield
unto
the
devil
and
choose
works
of
darkness
rather
than
light
therefore
they
must
go
down
to
hell

for
the
spirit
of
the
lord
will
not
always
strive
with
man
and
when
the
spirit
ceaseth
to
strive
with
man
then
cometh
speedy
destruction
and
this
grieveth
my
soul

and
as
i
spake
concerning
the
convincing
of
the
jews
that
jesus
is
the
very
christ
it
must
needs
be
that
the
gentiles
be
convinced
also
that
jesus
is
the
christ
the
eternal
god

and
that
he
manifesteth
himself
unto
all
those
who
believe
in
him
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
yea
unto
every
nation
kindred
tongue
and
people
working
mighty
miracles
signs
and
wonders
among
the
children
of
men
according
to
their
faith

but
behold
i
prophesy
unto
you
concerning
the
last
days
concerning
the
days
when
the
lord
god
shall
bring
these
things
forth
unto
the
children
of
men

after
my
seed
and
the
seed
of
my
brethren
shall
have
dwindled
in
unbelief
and
shall
have
been
smitten
by
the
gentiles
yea
after
the
lord
god
shall
have
camped
against
them
round
about
and
shall
have
laid
siege
against
them
with
a
mount
and
raised
forts
against
them
and
after
they
shall
have
been
brought
down
low
in
the
dust
even
that
they
are
not
yet
the
words
of
the
righteous
shall
be
written
and
the
prayers
of
the
faithful
shall
be
heard
and
all
those
who
have
dwindled
in
unbelief
shall
not
be
forgotten

for
those
who
shall
be
destroyed
shall
speak
unto
them
out
of
the
ground
and
their
speech
shall
be
low
out
of
the
dust
and
their
voice
shall
be
as
one
that
hath
a
familiar
spirit
for
the
lord
god
will
give
unto
him
power
that
he
may
whisper
concerning
them
even
as
it
were
out
of
the
ground
and
their
speech
shall
whisper
out
of
the
dust

for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
they
shall
write
the
things
which
shall
be
done
among
them
and
they
shall
be
written
and
sealed
up
in
a
book
and
those
who
have
dwindled
in
unbelief
shall
not
have
them
for
they
seek
to
destroy
the
things
of
god

wherefore
as
those
who
have
been
destroyed
have
been
destroyed
speedily
and
the
multitude
of
their
terrible
ones
shall
be
as
chaff
that
passeth
awayyea
thus
saith
the
lord
god
it
shall
be
at
an
instant
suddenly

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
those
who
have
dwindled
in
unbelief
shall
be
smitten
by
the
hand
of
the
gentiles

and
the
gentiles
are
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
eyes
and
have
stumbled
because
of
the
greatness
of
their
stumbling
block
that
they
have
built
up
many
churches
nevertheless
they
put
down
the
power
and
miracles
of
god
and
preach
up
unto
themselves
their
own
wisdom
and
their
own
learning
that
they
may
get
gain
and
grind
upon
the
face
of
the
poor

and
there
are
many
churches
built
up
which
cause
envyings
and
strifes
and
malice

and
there
are
also
secret
combinations
even
as
in
times
of
old
according
to
the
combinations
of
the
devil
for
he
is
the
founder
of
all
these
things
yea
the
founder
of
murder
and
works
of
darkness
yea
and
he
leadeth
them
by
the
neck
with
a
flaxen
cord
until
he
bindeth
them
with
his
strong
cords
forever

for
behold
my
beloved
brethren
i
say
unto
you
that
the
lord
god
worketh
not
in
darkness

he
doeth
not
anything
save
it
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
world
for
he
loveth
the
world
even
that
he
layeth
down
his
own
life
that
he
may
draw
all
men
unto
him
wherefore
he
commandeth
none
that
they
shall
not
partake
of
his
salvation

behold
doth
he
cry
unto
any
saying
depart
from
me
behold
i
say
unto
you
nay
but
he
saith
come
unto
me
all
ye
ends
of
the
earth
buy
milk
and
honey
without
money
and
without
price

behold
hath
he
commanded
any
that
they
should
depart
out
of
the
synagogues
or
out
of
the
houses
of
worship
behold
i
say
unto
you
nay

hath
he
commanded
any
that
they
should
not
partake
of
his
salvation
behold
i
say
unto
you
nay
but
he
hath
given
it
free
for
all
men
and
he
hath
commanded
his
people
that
they
should
persuade
all
men
to
repentance

behold
hath
the
lord
commanded
any
that
they
should
not
partake
of
his
goodness
behold
i
say
unto
you
nay
but
all
men
are
privileged
the
one
like
unto
the
other
and
none
are
forbidden

he
commandeth
that
there
shall
be
no
priestcrafts
for
behold
priestcrafts
are
that
men
preach
and
set
themselves
up
for
a
light
unto
the
world
that
they
may
get
gain
and
praise
of
the
world
but
they
seek
not
the
welfare
of
zion

behold
the
lord
hath
forbidden
this
thing
wherefore
the
lord
god
hath
given
a
commandment
that
all
men
should
have
charity
which
charity
is
love
and
except
they
should
have
charity
they
were
nothing
wherefore
if
they
should
have
charity
they
would
not
suffer
the
laborer
in
zion
to
perish

but
the
laborer
in
zion
shall
labor
for
zion
for
if
they
labor
for
money
they
shall
perish

and
again
the
lord
god
hath
commanded
that
men
should
not
murder
that
they
should
not
lie
that
they
should
not
steal
that
they
should
not
take
the
name
of
the
lord
their
god
in
vain
that
they
should
not
envy
that
they
should
not
have
malice
that
they
should
not
contend
one
with
another
that
they
should
not
commit
whoredoms
and
that
they
should
do
none
of
these
things
for
whoso
doeth
them
shall
perish

for
none
of
these
iniquities
come
of
the
lord
for
he
doeth
that
which
is
good
among
the
children
of
men
and
he
doeth
nothing
save
it
be
plain
unto
the
children
of
men
and
he
inviteth
them
all
to
come
unto
him
and
partake
of
his
goodness
and
he
denieth
none
that
come
unto
him
black
and
white
bond
and
free
male
and
female
and
he
remembereth
the
heathen
and
all
are
alike
unto
god
both
jew
and

but
behold
in

they

and
when

all

as
unto

even

all
ye
that

iniquity
stay

cry
out

cry
yea
ye
shall
be
drunken

not

ye
shall
stagger
but
not

for
behold
the
lord
hath
poured
out
upon
you
the
spirit
of
deep
sleep
for
behold
ye
have
closed
your
eyes
and
ye
have
rejected
the
prophets
and
your
rulers
and
the
seers
hath
he
covered
because
of
your
iniquity

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
lord
god
shall
bring
forth
unto
you
the
words
of
a
book
and
they
shall
be
the
words
of
them
which
have
slumbered

and
behold
the
book
shall
be
sealed
and
in
the
book
shall
be
a
revelation
from
god
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
to
the
ending
thereof

wherefore
because
of
the
things
which
are
sealed
up
the
things
which
are
sealed
shall
not
be
delivered
in
the
day
of
the
wickedness
and
abominations
of
the
people
wherefore
the
book
shall
be
kept
from
them

but
the
book
shall
be
delivered
unto
a
man
and
he
shall
deliver
the
words
of
the
book
which
are
the
words
of
those
who
have
slumbered
in
the
dust
and
he
shall
deliver
these
words
unto
another

but
the
words
which
are
sealed
he
shall
not
deliver
neither
shall
he
deliver
the
book
for
the
book
shall
be
sealed
by
the
power
of
god
and
the
revelation
which
was
sealed
shall
be
kept
in
the
book
until
the
own
due
time
of
the
lord
that
they
may
come
forth
for
behold
they
reveal
all
things
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
unto
the
end
thereof

and
the
day
cometh
that
the
words
of
the
book
which
were
sealed
shall
be
read
upon
the
house
tops
and
they
shall
be
read
by
the
power
of
christ
and
all
things
shall
be
revealed
unto
the
children
of
men
which
ever
have
been
among
the
children
of
men
and
which
ever
will
be
even
unto
the
end
of
the
earth

wherefore
at
that
day
when
the
book
shall
be
delivered
unto
the
man
of
whom
i
have
spoken
the
book
shall
be
hid
from
the
eyes
of
the
world
that
the
eyes
of
none
shall
behold
it
save
it
be
that
three
witnesses
shall
behold
it
by
the
power
of
god
besides
him
to
whom
the
book
shall
be
delivered
and
they
shall
testify
to
the
truth
of
the
book
and
the
things
therein

and
there
is
none
other
which
shall
view
it
save
it
be
a
few
according
to
the
will
of
god
to
bear
testimony
of
his
word
unto
the
children
of
men
for
the
lord
god
hath
said
that
the
words
of
the
faithful
should
speak
as
if
it
were
from
the
dead

wherefore
the
lord
god
will
proceed
to
bring
forth
the
words
of
the
book
and
in
the
mouth
of
as
many
witnesses
as
seemeth
him
good
will
he
establish
his
word
and
wo
be
unto
him
that
rejecteth
the
word
of
god

but
behold
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
lord
god
shall
say
unto
him
to
whom
he
shall
deliver
the
book
take
these
words
which
are
not
sealed
and
deliver
them
to
another
that
he
may
show
them
unto
the
learned
saying
read
this
i
pray
thee
and
the
learned
shall
say
bring
hither
the
book
and
i
will
read
them

and
now
because
of
the
glory
of
the
world
and
to
get
gain
will
they
say
this
and
not
for
the
glory
of
god

and
the
man
shall
say
i
cannot
bring
the
book
for
it
is
sealed

then
shall
the
learned
say
i
cannot
read
it

wherefore
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
lord
god
will
deliver
again
the
book
and
the
words
thereof
to
him
that
is
not
learned
and
the
man
that
is
not
learned
shall
say
i
am
not
learned

then
shall
the
lord
god
say
unto
him
the
learned
shall
not
read
them
for
they
have
rejected
them
and
i
am
able
to
do
mine
own
work
wherefore
thou
shalt
read
the
words
which
i
shall
give
unto
thee

touch
not
the
things
which
are
sealed
for
i
will
bring
them
forth
in
mine
own
due
time
for
i
will
show
unto
the
children
of
men
that
i
am
able
to
do
mine
own
work

wherefore
when
thou
hast
read
the
words
which
i
have
commanded
thee
and
obtained
the
witnesses
which
i
have
promised
unto
thee
then
shalt
thou
seal
up
the
book
again
and
hide
it
up
unto
me
that
i
may
preserve
the
words
which
thou
hast
not
read
until
i
shall
see
fit
in
mine
own
wisdom
to
reveal
all
things
unto
the
children
of
men

for
behold
i
am
god
and
i
am
a
god
of
miracles
and
i
will
show
unto
the
world
that
i
am
the
same
yesterday
today
and
forever
and
i
work
not
among
the
children
of
men
save
it
be
according
to
their
faith

and
again
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
lord
shall
say
unto
him
that
shall
read
the
words
that
shall
be
delivered
him

forasmuch
as
this
people
draw
near
unto
me
with
their
mouth
and
with
their
lips
do
honor
me
but
have
removed
their
hearts
far
from
me
and
their
fear
towards
me
is
taught
by
the
precepts
of
men

therefore
i
will
proceed
to
do
a
marvelous
work
among
this
people
yea
a
marvelous
work
and
a
wonder
for
the
wisdom
of
their
wise
and
learned
shall
perish
and
the
understanding
of
their
prudent
shall
be
hid

and
wo
unto
them
that
seek
deep
to
hide
their
counsel
from
the
lord
and
their
works
are
in
the
dark
and
they
say
who
seeth
us
and
who
knoweth
us
and
they
also
say
surely
your
turning
of
things
upside
down
shall
be
esteemed
as
the
potters
clay
but
behold
i
will
show
unto
them
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
that
i
know
all
their
works
for
shall
the
work
say
of
him
that
made
it
he
made
me
not
or
shall
the
thing
framed
say
of
him
that
framed
it
he
had
no
understanding

but
behold
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
i
will
show
unto
the
children
of
men
that
it
is
yet
a
very
little
while
and
lebanon
shall
be
turned
into
a
fruitful
field
and
the
fruitful
field
shall
be
esteemed
as
a
forest

and
in
that
day
shall
the
deaf
hear
the
words
of
the
book
and
the
eyes
of
the
blind
shall
see
out
of
obscurity
and
out
of
darkness

and
the
meek
also
shall
increase
and
their
joy
shall
be
in
the
lord
and
the
poor
among
men
shall
rejoice
in
the
holy
one
of
israel

for
assuredly
as
the
lord
liveth
they
shall
see
that
the
terrible
one
is
brought
to
naught
and
the
scorner
is
consumed
and
all
that
watch
for
iniquity
are
cut
off

and
they
that
make
a
man
an
offender
for
a
word
and
lay
a
snare
for
him
that
reproveth
in
the
gate
and
turn
aside
the
just
for
a
thing
of
naught

therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
who
redeemed
abraham
concerning
the
house
of
jacob
jacob
shall
not
now
be
ashamed
neither
shall
his
face
now
wax
pale

but
when
he
seeth
his
children
the
work
of
my
hands
in
the
midst
of
him
they
shall
sanctify
my
name
and
sanctify
the
holy
one
of
jacob
and
shall
fear
the
god
of
israel

they
also
that
erred
in
spirit
shall
come
to
understanding
and
they
that
murmured
shall
learn
doctrine

nephi
chapter


and
now
behold
my
brethren
i
have
spoken
unto
you
according
as
the
spirit
hath
constrained
me
wherefore
i
know
that
they
must
surely
come
to
pass

and
the
things
which
shall
be
written
out
of
the
book
shall
be
of
great
worth
unto
the
children
of
men
and
especially
unto
our
seed
which
is
a
remnant
of
the
house
of
israel

for
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
the
churches
which
are
built
up
and
not
unto
the
lord
when
the
one
shall
say
unto
the
other
behold
i
i
am
the
lords
and
the
others
shall
say
i
i
am
the
lords
and
thus
shall
every
one
say
that
hath
built
up
churches
and
not
unto
the
lord

and
they
shall
contend
one
with
another
and
their
priests
shall
contend
one
with
another
and
they
shall
teach
with
their
learning
and
deny
the
holy
ghost
which
giveth
utterance

and
they
deny
the
power
of
god
the
holy
one
of
israel
and
they
say
unto
the
people
hearken
unto
us
and
hear
ye
our
precept
for
behold
there
is
no
god
today
for
the
lord
and
the
redeemer
hath
done
his
work
and
he
hath
given
his
power
unto
men

behold
hearken
ye
unto
my
precept
if
they
shall
say
there
is
a
miracle
wrought
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
believe
it
not
for
this
day
he
is
not
a
god
of
miracles
he
hath
done
his
work

yea
and
there
shall
be
many
which
shall
say
eat
drink
and
be
merry
for
tomorrow
we
die
and
it
shall
be
well
with
us

and
there
shall
also
be
many
which
shall
say
eat
drink
and
be
merry
nevertheless
fear
godhe
will
justify
in
committing
a
little
sin
yea
lie
a
little
take
the
advantage
of
one
because
of
his
words
dig
a
pit
for
thy
neighbor
there
is
no
harm
in
this
and
do
all
these
things
for
tomorrow
we
die
and
if
it
so
be
that
we
are
guilty
god
will
beat
us
with
a
few
stripes
and
at
last
we
shall
be
saved
in
the
kingdom
of
god

yea
and
there
shall
be
many
which
shall
teach
after
this
manner
false
and
vain
and
foolish
doctrines
and
shall
be
puffed
up
in
their
hearts
and
shall
seek
deep
to
hide
their
counsels
from
the
lord
and
their
works
shall
be
in
the
dark

and
the
blood
of
the
saints
shall
cry
from
the
ground
against
them

yea
they
have
all
gone
out
of
the
way
they
have
become
corrupted

because
of
pride
and
because
of
false
teachers
and
false
doctrine
their
churches
have
become
corrupted
and
their
churches
are
lifted
up
because
of
pride
they
are
puffed
up

they
rob
the
poor
because
of
their
fine
sanctuaries
they
rob
the
poor
because
of
their
fine
clothing
and
they
persecute
the
meek
and
the
poor
in
heart
because
in
their
pride
they
are
puffed
up

they
wear
stiff
necks
and
high
heads
yea
and
because
of
pride
and
wickedness
and
abominations
and
whoredoms
they
have
all
gone
astray
save
it
be
a
few
who
are
the
humble
followers
of
christ
nevertheless
they
are
led
that
in
many
instances
they
do
err
because
they
are
taught
by
the
precepts
of
men

o
the
wise
and
the
learned
and
the
rich
that
are
puffed
up
in
the
pride
of
their
hearts
and
all
those
who
preach
false
doctrines
and
all
those
who
commit
whoredoms
and
pervert
the
right
way
of
the
lord
wo
wo
wo
be
unto
them
saith
the
lord
god
almighty
for
they
shall
be
thrust
down
to
hell

wo
unto
them
that
turn
aside
the
just
for
a
thing
of
naught
and
revile
against
that
which
is
good
and
say
that
is
of
no
worth
for
the
day
shall
come
that
the
lord
god
will
speedily
visit
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
and
in
that
day
that
they
are
fully
ripe
in
iniquity
they
shall
perish

but
behold
if
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
shall
repent
of
their
wickedness
and
abominations
they
shall
not
be
destroyed
saith
the
lord
of
hosts

but
behold
that
great
and
abominable
church
the
whore
of
all
the
earth
must
tumble
to
the
earth
and
great
must
be
the
fall
thereof

for
the
kingdom
of
the
devil
must
shake
and
they
which
belong
to
it
must
needs
be
stirred
up
unto
repentance
or
the
devil
will
grasp
them
with
his
everlasting
chains
and
they
be
stirred
up
to
anger
and
perish

for
behold
at
that
day
shall
he
rage
in
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
and
stir
them
up
to
anger
against
that
which
is
good

and
others
will
he
pacify
and
lull
them
away
into
carnal
security
that
they
will
say
all
is
well
in
zion
yea
zion
prospereth
all
is
welland
thus
the
devil
cheateth
their
souls
and
leadeth
them
away
carefully
down
to
hell

and
behold
others
he
flattereth
away
and
telleth
them
there
is
no
hell
and
he
saith
unto
them
i
am
no
devil
for
there
is
noneand
thus
he
whispereth
in
their
ears
until
he
grasps
them
with
his
awful
chains
from
whence
there
is
no
deliverance

yea
they
are
grasped
with
death
and
hell
and
death
and
hell
and
the
devil
and
all
that
have
been
seized
therewith
must
stand
before
the
throne
of
god
and
be
judged
according
to
their
works
from
whence
they
must
go
into
the
place
prepared
for
them
even
a
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
which
is
endless
torment

therefore
wo
be
unto
him
that
is
at
ease
in
zion

wo
be
unto
him
that
crieth
all
is
well

yea
wo
be
unto
him
that
hearkeneth
unto
the
precepts
of
men
and
denieth
the
power
of
god
and
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost

yea
wo
be
unto
him
that
saith
we
have
received
and
we
need
no
more

and
in
fine
wo
unto
all
those
who
tremble
and
are
angry
because
of
the
truth
of
god
for
behold
he
that
is
built
upon
the
rock
receiveth
it
with
gladness
and
he
that
is
built
upon
a
sandy
foundation
trembleth
lest
he
shall
fall

wo
be
unto
him
that
shall
say
we
have
received
the
word
of
god
and
we
need
no
more
of
the
word
of
god
for
we
have
enough

for
behold
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
will
give
unto
the
children
of
men
line
upon
line
precept
upon
precept
here
a
little
and
there
a
little
and
blessed
are
those
who
hearken
unto
my
precepts
and
lend
an
ear
unto
my
counsel
for
they
shall
learn
wisdom
for
unto
him
that
receiveth
i
will
give
more
and
from
them
that
shall
say
we
have
enough
from
them
shall
be
taken
away
even
that
which
they
have

cursed
is
he
that
putteth
his
trust
in
man
or
maketh
flesh
his
arm
or
shall
hearken
unto
the
precepts
of
men
save
their
precepts
shall
be
given
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost

wo
be
unto
the
gentiles
saith
the
lord
god
of
hosts
for
notwithstanding
i
shall
lengthen
out
mine
arm
unto
them
from
day
to
day
they
will
deny
me
nevertheless
i
will
be
merciful
unto
them
saith
the
lord
god
if
they
will
repent
and
come
unto
me
for
mine
arm
is
lengthened
out
all
the
day
long
saith
the
lord

nephi
chapter


but
behold
there
shall
be
manyat
that
day
when
i
shall
proceed
to
do
a
marvelous
work
among
them
that
i
may
remember
my
covenants
which
i
have
made
unto
the
children
of
men
that
i
may
set
my
hand
again
the
second
time
to
recover
my
people
which
are
of
the
house
of
israel

and
also
that
i
may
remember
the
promises
which
i
have
made
unto
thee
nephi
and
also
unto
thy
father
that
i
would
remember
your
seed
and
that
the
words
of
your
seed
should
proceed
forth
out
of
my
mouth
unto
your
seed
and
my
words
shall
hiss
forth
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
for
a
standard
unto
my
people
which
are
of
the
house
of
israel

and
because
my
words
shall
hiss
forthmany
of
the
gentiles
shall
say
a
bible
a
bible
we
have
got
a
bible
and
there
cannot
be
any
more
bible

but
thus
saith
the
lord
god
o
fools
they
shall
have
a
bible
and
it
shall
proceed
forth
from
the
jews
mine
ancient
covenant
people
and
what
thank
they
the
jews
for
the
bible
which
they
receive
from
them
yea
what
do
the
gentiles
mean
do
they
remember
the
travails
and
the
labors
and
the
pains
of
the
jews
and
their
diligence
unto
me
in
bringing
forth
salvation
unto
the
gentiles

o
ye
gentiles
have
ye
remembered
the
jews
mine
ancient
covenant
people
nay
but
ye
have
cursed
them
and
have
hated
them
and
have
not
sought
to
recover
them
but
behold
i
will
return
all
these
things
upon
your
own
heads
for
i
the
lord
have
not
forgotten
my
people

thou
fool
that
shall
say
a
bible
we
have
got
a
bible
and
we
need
no
more
bible
have
ye
obtained
a
bible
save
it
were
by
the
jews

know
ye
not
that
there
are
more
nations
than
one
know
ye
not
that
i
the
lord
your
god
have
created
all
men
and
that
i
remember
those
who
are
upon
the
isles
of
the
sea
and
that
i
rule
in
the
heavens
above
and
in
the
earth
beneath
and
i
bring
forth
my
word
unto
the
children
of
men
yea
even
upon
all
the
nations
of
the
earth

wherefore
murmur
ye
because
that
ye
shall
receive
more
of
my
word
know
ye
not
that
the
testimony
of
two
nations
is
a
witness
unto
you
that
i
am
god
that
i
remember
one
nation
like
unto
another
wherefore
i
speak
the
same
words
unto
one
nation
like
unto
another
and
when
the
two
nations
shall
run
together
the
testimony
of
the
two
nations
shall
run
together
also

and
i
do
this
that
i
may
prove
unto
many
that
i
am
the
same
yesterday
today
and
forever
and
that
i
speak
forth
my
words
according
to
mine
own
pleasure
and
because
that
i
have
spoken
one
word
ye
need
not
suppose
that
i
cannot
speak
another
for
my
work
is
not
yet
finished
neither
shall
it
be
until
the
end
of
man
neither
from
that
time
henceforth
and
forever

wherefore
because
that
ye
have
a
bible
ye
need
not
suppose
that
it
contains
all
my
words
neither
need
ye
suppose
that
i
have
not
caused
more
to
be
written

for
i
command
all
men
both
in
the
east
and
in
the
west
and
in
the
north
and
in
the
south
and
in
the
islands
of
the
sea
that
they
shall
write
the
words
which
i
speak
unto
them
for
out
of
the
books
which
shall
be
written
i
will
judge
the
world
every
man
according
to
their
works
according
to
that
which
is
written

for
behold
i
shall
speak
unto
the
jews
and
they
shall
write
it
and
i
shall
also
speak
unto
the
nephites
and
they
shall
write
it
and
i
shall
also
speak
unto
the
other
tribes
of
the
house
of
israel
which
i
have
led
away
and
they
shall
write
it
and
i
shall
also
speak
unto
all
nations
of
the
earth
and
they
shall
write
it

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
jews
shall
have
the
words
of
the
nephites
and
the
nephites
shall
have
the
words
of
the
jews
and
the
nephites
and
the
jews
shall
have
the
words
of
the
lost
tribes
of
israel
and
the
lost
tribes
of
israel
shall
have
the
words
of
the
nephites
and
the
jews

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
my
people
which
are
of
the
house
of
israel
shall
be
gathered
home
unto
the
lands
of
their
possessions
and
my
word
also
shall
be
gathered
in
one
and
i
will
show
unto
them
that
fight
against
my
word
and
against
my
people
who
are
of
the
house
of
israel
that
i
am
god
and
that
i
covenanted
with
abraham
that
i
would
remember
his
seed
forever

nephi
chapter


and
now
behold
my
beloved
brethren
i
would
speak
unto
you
for
i
nephi
would
not
suffer
that
ye
should
suppose
that
ye
are
more
righteous
than
the
gentiles
shall
be
for
behold
except
ye
shall
keep
the
commandments
of
god
ye
shall
all
likewise
perish
and
because
of
the
words
which
have
been
spoken
ye
need
not
suppose
that
the
gentiles
are
utterly
destroyed

for
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
as
many
of
the
gentiles
as
will
repent
are
the
covenant
people
of
the
lord
and
as
many
of
the
jews
as
will
not
repent
shall
be
cast
off
for
the
lord
covenanteth
with
none
save
it
be
with
them
that
repent
and
believe
in
his
son
who
is
the
holy
one
of
israel

and
now
i
would
prophesy
somewhat
more
concerning
the
jews
and
the
gentiles
for
after
the
book
of
which
i
have
spoken
shall
come
forth
and
be
written
unto
the
gentiles
and
sealed
up
again
unto
the
lord
there
shall
be
many
which
shall
believe
the
words
which
are
written
and
they
shall
carry
them
forth
unto
the
remnant
of
our
seed

and
then
shall
the
remnant
of
our
seed
know
concerning
us
how
that
we
came
out
from
jerusalem
and
that
they
are
descendants
of
the
jews

and
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
shall
be
declared
among
them
wherefore
they
shall
be
restored
unto
the
knowledge
of
their
fathers
and
also
to
the
knowledge
of
jesus
christ
which
was
had
among
their
fathers

and
then
shall
they
rejoice
for
they
shall
know
that
it
is
a
blessing
unto
them
from
the
hand
of
god
and
their
scales
of
darkness
shall
begin
to
fall
from
their
eyes
and
many
generations
shall
not
pass
away
among
them
save
they
shall
be
a
pure
and
delightsome
people

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
jews
which
are
scattered
also
shall
begin
to
believe
in
christ
and
they
shall
begin
to
gather
in
upon
the
face
of
the
land
and
as
many
as
shall
believe
in
christ
shall
also
become
a
delightsome
people

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
lord
god
shall
commence
his
work
among
all
nations
kindreds
tongues
and
people
to
bring
about
the
restoration
of
his
people
upon
the
earth

and
with
righteousness
shall
the
lord
god
judge
the
poor
and
reprove
with
equity
for
the
meek
of
the
earth
and
he
shall
smite
the
earth
with
the
rod
of
his
mouth
and
with
the
breath
of
his
lips
shall
he
slay
the
wicked

for
the
time
speedily
cometh
that
the
lord
god
shall
cause
a
great
division
among
the
people
and
the
wicked
will
he
destroy
and
he
will
spare
his
people
yea
even
if
it
so
be
that
he
must
destroy
the
wicked
by
fire

and
righteousness
shall
be
the
girdle
of
his
loins
and
faithfulness
the
girdle
of
his
reins

and
then
shall
the
wolf
dwell
with
the
lamb
and
the
leopard
shall
lie
down
with
the
kid
and
the
calf
and
the
young
lion
and
the
fatling
together
and
a
little
child
shall
lead
them

and
the
cow
and
the
bear
shall
feed
their
young
ones
shall
lie
down
together
and
the
lion
shall
eat
straw
like
the
ox

and
the
sucking
child
shall
play
on
the
hole
of
the
asp
and
the
weaned
child
shall
put
his
hand
on
the
cockatrices
den

they
shall
not
hurt
nor
destroy
in
all
my
holy
mountain
for
the
earth
shall
be
full
of
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
as
the
waters
cover
the
sea

wherefore
the
things
of
all
nations
shall
be
made
known
yea
all
things
shall
be
made
known
unto
the
children
of
men

there
is
nothing
which
is
secret
save
it
shall
be
revealed
there
is
no
work
of
darkness
save
it
shall
be
made
manifest
in
the
light
and
there
is
nothing
which
is
sealed
upon
the
earth
save
it
shall
be
loosed

wherefore
all
things
which
have
been
revealed
unto
the
children
of
men
shall
at
that
day
be
revealed
and
satan
shall
have
power
over
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
no
more
for
a
long
time
and
now
my
beloved
brethren
i
make
an
end
of
my
sayings

nephi
chapter


and
now
i
nephi
make
an
end
of
my
prophesying
unto
you
my
beloved
brethren
and
i
cannot
write
but
a
few
things
which
i
know
must
surely
come
to
pass
neither
can
i
write
but
a
few
of
the
words
of
my
brother
jacob

wherefore
the
things
which
i
have
written
sufficeth
me
save
it
be
a
few
words
which
i
must
speak
concerning
the
doctrine
of
christ
wherefore
i
shall
speak
unto
you
plainly
according
to
the
plainness
of
my
prophesying

for
my
soul
delighteth
in
plainness
for
after
this
manner
doth
the
lord
god
work
among
the
children
of
men
for
the
lord
god
giveth
light
unto
the
understanding
for
he
speaketh
unto
men
according
to
their
language
unto
their
understanding

wherefore
i
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
i
have
spoken
unto
you
concerning
that
prophet
which
the
lord
showed
unto
me
that
should
baptize
the
lamb
of
god
which
should
take
away
the
sins
of
the
world

and
now
if
the
lamb
of
god
he
being
holy
should
have
need
to
be
baptized
by
water
to
fulfil
all
righteousness
o
then
how
much
more
need
have
we
being
unholy
to
be
baptized
yea
even
by
water

and
now
i
would
ask
of
you
my
beloved
brethren
wherein
the
lamb
of
god
did
fulfil
all
righteousness
in
being
baptized
by
water

know
ye
not
that
he
was
holy
but
notwithstanding
he
being
holy
he
showeth
unto
the
children
of
men
that
according
to
the
flesh
he
humbleth
himself
before
the
father
and
witnesseth
unto
the
father
that
he
would
be
obedient
unto
him
in
keeping
his
commandments

wherefore
after
he
was
baptized
with
water
the
holy
ghost
descended
upon
him
in
the
form
of
a
dove

and
again
it
showeth
unto
the
children
of
men
the
straightness
of
the
path
and
the
narrowness
of
the
gate
by
which
they
should
enter
he
having
set
the
example
before
them

and
he
said
unto
the
children
of
men
follow
thou
me
wherefore
my
beloved
brethren
can
we
follow
jesus
save
we
shall
be
willing
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
father

and
the
father
said
repent
ye
repent
ye
and
be
baptized
in
the
name
of
my
beloved
son

and
also
the
voice
of
the
son
came
unto
me
saying
he
that
is
baptized
in
my
name
to
him
will
the
father
give
the
holy
ghost
like
unto
me
wherefore
follow
me
and
do
the
things
which
ye
have
seen
me
do

wherefore
my
beloved
brethren
i
know
that
if
ye
shall
follow
the
son
with
full
purpose
of
heart
acting
no
hypocrisy
and
no
deception
before
god
but
with
real
intent
repenting
of
your
sins
witnessing
unto
the
father
that
ye
are
willing
to
take
upon
you
the
name
of
christ
by
baptismyea
by
following
your
lord
and
your
savior
down
into
the
water
according
to
his
word
behold
then
shall
ye
receive
the
holy
ghost
yea
then
cometh
the
baptism
of
fire
and
of
the
holy
ghost
and
then
can
ye
speak
with
the
tongue
of
angels
and
shout
praises
unto
the
holy
one
of
israel

but
behold
my
beloved
brethren
thus
came
the
voice
of
the
son
unto
me
saying
after
ye
have
repented
of
your
sins
and
witnessed
unto
the
father
that
ye
are
willing
to
keep
my
commandments
by
the
baptism
of
water
and
have
received
the
baptism
of
fire
and
of
the
holy
ghost
and
can
speak
with
a
new
tongue
yea
even
with
the
tongue
of
angels
and
after
this
should
deny
me
it
would
have
been
better
for
you
that
ye
had
not
known
me

and
i
heard
a
voice
from
the
father
saying
yea
the
words
of
my
beloved
are
true
and
faithful
he
that
endureth
to
the
end
the
same
shall
be
saved

and
now
my
beloved
brethren
i
know
by
this
that
unless
a
man
shall
endure
to
the
end
in
following
the
example
of
the
son
of
the
living
god
he
cannot
be
saved

wherefore
do
the
things
which
i
have
told
you
i
have
seen
that
your
lord
and
your
redeemer
should
do
for
for
this
cause
have
they
been
shown
unto
me
that
ye
might
know
the
gate
by
which
ye
should
enter
for
the
gate
by
which
ye
should
enter
is
repentance
and
baptism
by
water
and
then
cometh
a
remission
of
your
sins
by
fire
and
by
the
holy
ghost

and
then
are
ye
in
this
strait
and
narrow
path
which
leads
to
eternal
life
yea
ye
have
entered
in
by
the
gate
ye
have
done
according
to
the
commandments
of
the
father
and
the
son
and
ye
have
received
the
holy
ghost
which
witnesses
of
the
father
and
the
son
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
promise
which
he
hath
made
that
if
ye
entered
in
by
the
way
ye
should
receive

and
now
my
beloved
brethren
after
ye
have
gotten
into
this
strait
and
narrow
path
i
would
ask
if
all
is
done
behold
i
say
unto
you
nay
for
ye
have
not
come
thus
far
save
it
were
by
the
word
of
christ
with
unshaken
faith
in
him
relying
wholly
upon
the
merits
of
him
who
is
mighty
to
save

wherefore
ye
must
press
forward
with
a
steadfastness
in
christ
having
a
perfect
brightness
of
hope
and
a
love
of
god
and
of
all
men
wherefore
if
ye
shall
press
forward
feasting
upon
the
word
of
christ
and
endure
to
the
end
behold
thus
saith
the
father
ye
shall
have
eternal
life

and
now
behold
my
beloved
brethren
this
is
the
way
and
there
is
none
other
way
nor
name
given
under
heaven
whereby
man
can
be
saved
in
the
kingdom
of
god
and
now
behold
this
is
the
doctrine
of
christ
and
the
only
and
true
doctrine
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
which
is
one
god
without
end
amen

nephi
chapter


and
now
behold
my
beloved
brethren
i
suppose
that
ye
ponder
somewhat
in
your
hearts
concerning
that
which
ye
should
do
after
ye
have
entered
in
by
the
way
but
behold
why
do
ye
ponder
these
things
in
your
hearts

do
ye
not
remember
that
i
said
unto
you
that
after
ye
had
received
the
holy
ghost
ye
could
speak
with
the
tongue
of
angels
and
now
how
could
ye
speak
with
the
tongue
of
angels
save
it
were
by
the
holy
ghost

angels
speak
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
wherefore
they
speak
the
words
of
christ
wherefore
i
said
unto
you
feast
upon
the
words
of
christ
for
behold
the
words
of
christ
will
tell
you
all
things
what
ye
should
do

wherefore
now
after
i
have
spoken
these
words
if
ye
cannot
understand
them
it
will
be
because
ye
ask
not
neither
do
ye
knock
wherefore
ye
are
not
brought
into
the
light
but
must
perish
in
the
dark

for
behold
again
i
say
unto
you
that
if
ye
will
enter
in
by
the
way
and
receive
the
holy
ghost
it
will
show
unto
you
all
things
what
ye
should
do

behold
this
is
the
doctrine
of
christ
and
there
will
be
no
more
doctrine
given
until
after
he
shall
manifest
himself
unto
you
in
the
flesh
and
when
he
shall
manifest
himself
unto
you
in
the
flesh
the
things
which
he
shall
say
unto
you
shall
ye
observe
to
do

and
now
i
nephi
cannot
say
more
the
spirit
stoppeth
mine
utterance
and
i
am
left
to
mourn
because
of
the
unbelief
and
the
wickedness
and
the
ignorance
and
the
stiffneckedness
of
men
for
they
will
not
search
knowledge
nor
understand
great
knowledge
when
it
is
given
unto
them
in
plainness
even
as
plain
as
word
can
be

and
now
my
beloved
brethren
i
perceive
that
ye
ponder
still
in
your
hearts
and
it
grieveth
me
that
i
must
speak
concerning
this
thing
for
if
ye
would
hearken
unto
the
spirit
which
teacheth
a
man
to
pray
ye
would
know
that
ye
must
pray
for
the
evil
spirit
teacheth
not
a
man
to
pray
but
teacheth
him
that
he
must
not
pray

but
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
ye
must
pray
always
and
not
faint
that
ye
must
not
perform
any
thing
unto
the
lord
save
in
the
first
place
ye
shall
pray
unto
the
father
in
the
name
of
christ
that
he
will
consecrate
thy
performance
unto
thee
that
thy
performance
may
be
for
the
welfare
of
thy
soul

nephi
chapter


and
now
i
nephi
cannot
write
all
the
things
which
were
taught
among
my
people
neither
am
i
mighty
in
writing
like
unto
speaking
for
when
a
man
speaketh
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
carrieth
it
unto
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men

but
behold
there
are
many
that
harden
their
hearts
against
the
holy
spirit
that
it
hath
no
place
in
them
wherefore
they
cast
many
things
away
which
are
written
and
esteem
them
as
things
of
naught

but
i
nephi
have
written
what
i
have
written
and
i
esteem
it
as
of
great
worth
and
especially
unto
my
people
for
i
pray
continually
for
them
by
day
and
mine
eyes
water
my
pillow
by
night
because
of
them
and
i
cry
unto
my
god
in
faith
and
i
know
that
he
will
hear
my
cry

and
i
know
that
the
lord
god
will
consecrate
my
prayers
for
the
gain
of
my
people
and
the
words
which
i
have
written
in
weakness
will
be
made
strong
unto
them
for
it
persuadeth
them
to
do
good
it
maketh
known
unto
them
of
their
fathers
and
it
speaketh
of
jesus
and
persuadeth
them
to
believe
in
him
and
to
endure
to
the
end
which
is
life
eternal

and
it
speaketh
harshly
against
sin
according
to
the
plainness
of
the
truth
wherefore
no
man
will
be
angry
at
the
words
which
i
have
written
save
he
shall
be
of
the
spirit
of
the
devil

i
glory
in
plainness
i
glory
in
truth
i
glory
in
my
jesus
for
he
hath
redeemed
my
soul
from
hell

i
have
charity
for
my
people
and
great
faith
in
christ
that
i
shall
meet
many
souls
spotless
at
his
judgmentseat

i
have
charity
for
the
jewi
say
jew
because
i
mean
them
from
whence
i
came

i
also
have
charity
for
the
gentiles
but
behold
for
none
of
these
can
i
hope
except
they
shall
be
reconciled
unto
christ
and
enter
into
the
narrow
gate
and
walk
in
the
strait
path
which
leads
to
life
and
continue
in
the
path
until
the
end
of
the
day
of
probation

and
now
my
beloved
brethren
and
also
jew
and
all
ye
ends
of
the
earth
hearken
unto
these
words
and
believe
in
christ
and
if
ye
believe
not
in
these
words
believe
in
christ
and
if
ye
shall
believe
in
christ
ye
will
believe
in
these
words
for
they
are
the
words
of
christ
and
he
hath
given
them
unto
me
and
they
teach
all
men
that
they
should
do
good

and
if
they
are
not
the
words
of
christ
judge
yefor
christ
will
show
unto
you
with
power
and
great
glory
that
they
are
his
words
at
the
last
day
and
you
and
i
shall
stand
face
to
face
before
his
bar
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
have
been
commanded
of
him
to
write
these
things
notwithstanding
my
weakness

and
i
pray
the
father
in
the
name
of
christ
that
many
of
us
if
not
all
may
be
saved
in
his
kingdom
at
that
great
and
last
day

and
now
my
beloved
brethren
all
those
who
are
of
the
house
of
israel
and
all
ye
ends
of
the
earth
i
speak
unto
you
as
the
voice
of
one
crying
from
the
dust
farewell
until
that
great
day
shall
come

and
you
that
will
not
partake
of
the
goodness
of
god
and
respect
the
words
of
the
jews
and
also
my
words
and
the
words
which
shall
proceed
forth
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
lamb
of
god
behold
i
bid
you
an
everlasting
farewell
for
these
words
shall
condemn
you
at
the
last
day

for
what
i
seal
on
earth
shall
be
brought
against
you
at
the
judgment
bar
for
thus
hath
the
lord
commanded
me
and
i
must
obey
amen
the
book
of
jacob
the
brother
of
nephi
the
words
of
his
preaching
unto
his
brethren
he
confoundeth
a
man
who
seeketh
to
overthrow
the
doctrine
of
christ
a
few
words
concerning
the
history
of
the
people
of
nephi
jacob
chapter


for
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
fifty
and
five
years
had
passed
away
from
the
time
that
lehi
left
jerusalem
wherefore
nephi
gave
me
jacob
a
commandment
concerning
the
small
plates
upon
which
these
things
are
engraven

and
he
gave
me
jacob
a
commandment
that
i
should
write
upon
these
plates
a
few
of
the
things
which
i
consider
to
be
most
precious
that
i
should
not
touch
save
it
were
lightly
concerning
the
history
of
this
people
which
are
called
the
people
of
nephi

for
he
said
that
the
history
of
his
people
should
be
engraven
upon
his
other
plates
and
that
i
should
preserve
these
plates
and
hand
them
down
unto
my
seed
from
generation
to
generation

and
if
there
were
preaching
which
was
sacred
or
revelation
which
was
great
or
prophesying
that
i
should
engraven
the
heads
of
them
upon
these
plates
and
touch
upon
them
as
much
as
it
were
possible
for
christs
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
our
people

for
because
of
faith
and
great
anxiety
it
truly
had
been
made
manifest
unto
us
concerning
our
people
what
things
should
happen
unto
them

and
we
also
had
many
revelations
and
the
spirit
of
much
prophecy
wherefore
we
knew
of
christ
and
his
kingdom
which
should
come

wherefore
we
labored
diligently
among
our
people
that
we
might
persuade
them
to
come
unto
christ
and
partake
of
the
goodness
of
god
that
they
might
enter
into
his
rest
lest
by
any
means
he
should
swear
in
his
wrath
they
should
not
enter
in
as
in
the
provocation
in
the
days
of
temptation
while
the
children
of
israel
were
in
the
wilderness

wherefore
we
would
to
god
that
we
could
persuade
all
men
not
to
rebel
against
god
to
provoke
him
to
anger
but
that
all
men
would
believe
in
christ
and
view
his
death
and
suffer
his
cross
and
bear
the
shame
of
the
world
wherefore
i
jacob
take
it
upon
me
to
fulfil
the
commandment
of
my
brother
nephi

now
nephi
began
to
be
old
and
he
saw
that
he
must
soon
die
wherefore
he
anointed
a
man
to
be
a
king
and
a
ruler
over
his
people
now
according
to
the
reigns
of
the
kings

the
people
having
loved
nephi
exceedingly
he
having
been
a
great
protector
for
them
having
wielded
the
sword
of
laban
in
their
defence
and
having
labored
in
all
his
days
for
their
welfare

wherefore
the
people
were
desirous
to
retain
in
remembrance
his
name
and
whoso
should
reign
in
his
stead
were
called
by
the
people
second
nephi
third
nephi
and
so
forth
according
to
the
reigns
of
the
kings
and
thus
they
were
called
by
the
people
let
them
be
of
whatever
name
they
would

and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephi
died

now
the
people
which
were
not
lamanites
were
nephites
nevertheless
they
were
called
nephites
jacobites
josephites
zoramites
lamanites
lemuelites
and
ishmaelites

but
i
jacob
shall
not
hereafter
distinguish
them
by
these
names
but
i
shall
call
them
lamanites
that
seek
to
destroy
the
people
of
nephi
and
those
who
are
friendly
to
nephi
i
shall
call
nephites
or
the
people
of
nephi
according
to
the
reigns
of
the
kings

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
nephi
under
the
reign
of
the
second
king
began
to
grow
hard
in
their
hearts
and
indulge
themselves
somewhat
in
wicked
practices
such
as
like
unto
david
of
old
desiring
many
wives
and
concubines
and
also
solomon
his
son

yea
and
they
also
began
to
search
much
gold
and
silver
and
began
to
be
lifted
up
somewhat
in
pride

wherefore
i
jacob
gave
unto
them
these
words
as
i
taught
them
in
the
temple
having
first
obtained
mine
errand
from
the
lord

for
i
jacob
and
my
brother
joseph
had
been
consecrated
priests
and
teachers
of
this
people
by
the
hand
of
nephi

and
we
did
magnify
our
office
unto
the
lord
taking
upon
us
the
responsibility
answering
the
sins
of
the
people
upon
our
own
heads
if
we
did
not
teach
them
the
word
of
god
with
all
diligence
wherefore
by
laboring
with
our
might
their
blood
might
not
come
upon
our
garments
otherwise
their
blood
would
come
upon
our
garments
and
we
would
not
be
found
spotless
at
the
last
day
jacob
chapter


the
words
which
jacob
the
brother
of
nephi
spake
unto
the
people
of
nephi
after
the
death
of
nephi

now
my
beloved
brethren
i
jacob
according
to
the
responsibility
which
i
am
under
to
god
to
magnify
mine
office
with
soberness
and
that
i
might
rid
my
garments
of
your
sins
i
come
up
into
the
temple
this
day
that
i
might
declare
unto
you
the
word
of
god

and
ye
yourselves
know
that
i
have
hitherto
been
diligent
in
the
office
of
my
calling
but
i
this
day
am
weighed
down
with
much
more
desire
and
anxiety
for
the
welfare
of
your
souls
than
i
have
hitherto
been

for
behold
as
yet
ye
have
been
obedient
unto
the
word
of
the
lord
which
i
have
given
unto
you

but
behold
hearken
ye
unto
me
and
know
that
by
the
help
of
the
allpowerful
creator
of
heaven
and
earth
i
can
tell
you
concerning
your
thoughts
how
that
ye
are
beginning
to
labor
in
sin
which
sin
appeareth
very
abominable
unto
me
yea
and
abominable
unto
god

yea
it
grieveth
my
soul
and
causeth
me
to
shrink
with
shame
before
the
presence
of
my
maker
that
i
must
testify
unto
you
concerning
the
wickedness
of
your
hearts

and
also
it
grieveth
me
that
i
must
use
so
much
boldness
of
speech
concerning
you
before
your
wives
and
your
children
many
of
whose
feelings
are
exceedingly
tender
and
chaste
and
delicate
before
god
which
thing
is
pleasing
unto
god

and
it
supposeth
me
that
they
have
come
up
hither
to
hear
the
pleasing
word
of
god
yea
the
word
which
healeth
the
wounded
soul

wherefore
it
burdeneth
my
soul
that
i
should
be
constrained
because
of
the
strict
commandment
which
i
have
received
from
god
to
admonish
you
according
to
your
crimes
to
enlarge
the
wounds
of
those
who
are
already
wounded
instead
of
consoling
and
healing
their
wounds
and
those
who
have
not
been
wounded
instead
of
feasting
upon
the
pleasing
word
of
god
have
daggers
placed
to
pierce
their
souls
and
wound
their
delicate
minds

but
notwithstanding
the
greatness
of
the
task
i
must
do
according
to
the
strict
commands
of
god
and
tell
you
concerning
your
wickedness
and
abominations
in
the
presence
of
the
pure
in
heart
and
the
broken
heart
and
under
the
glance
of
the
piercing
eye
of
the
almighty
god

wherefore
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
according
to
the
plainness
of
the
word
of
god
for
behold
as
i
inquired
of
the
lord
thus
came
the
word
unto
me
saying
jacob
get
thou
up
into
the
temple
on
the
morrow
and
declare
the
word
which
i
shall
give
thee
unto
this
people

and
now
behold
my
brethren
this
is
the
word
which
i
declare
unto
you
that
many
of
you
have
begun
to
search
for
gold
and
for
silver
and
for
all
manner
of
precious
ores
in
the
which
this
land
which
is
a
land
of
promise
unto
you
and
to
your
seed
doth
abound
most
plentifully

and
the
hand
of
providence
hath
smiled
upon
you
most
pleasingly
that
you
have
obtained
many
riches
and
because
some
of
you
have
obtained
more
abundantly
than
that
of
your
brethren
ye
are
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
your
hearts
and
wear
stiff
necks
and
high
heads
because
of
the
costliness
of
your
apparel
and
persecute
your
brethren
because
ye
suppose
that
ye
are
better
than
they

and
now
my
brethren
do
ye
suppose
that
god
justifieth
you
in
this
thing
behold
i
say
unto
you
nay
but
he
condemneth
you
and
if
ye
persist
in
these
things
his
judgments
must
speedily
come
unto
you

o
that
he
would
show
you
that
he
can
pierce
you
and
with
one
glance
of
his
eye
he
can
smite
you
to
the
dust

o
that
he
would
rid
you
from
this
iniquity
and
abomination
and
o
that
ye
would
listen
unto
the
word
of
his
commands
and
let
not
this
pride
of
your
hearts
destroy
your
souls

think
of
your
brethren
like
unto
yourselves
and
be
familiar
with
all
and
free
with
your
substance
that
they
may
be
rich
like
unto
you

but
before
ye
seek
for
riches
seek
ye
for
the
kingdom
of
god

and
after
ye
have
obtained
a
hope
in
christ
ye
shall
obtain
riches
if
ye
seek
them
and
ye
will
seek
them
for
the
intent
to
do
goodto
clothe
the
naked
and
to
feed
the
hungry
and
to
liberate
the
captive
and
administer
relief
to
the
sick
and
the
afflicted

and
now
my
brethren
i
have
spoken
unto
you
concerning
pride
and
those
of
you
which
have
afflicted
your
neighbor
and
persecuted
him
because
ye
were
proud
in
your
hearts
of
the
things
which
god
hath
given
you
what
say
ye
of
it

do
ye
not
suppose
that
such
things
are
abominable
unto
him
who
created
all
flesh
and
the
one
being
is
as
precious
in
his
sight
as
the
other
and
all
flesh
is
of
the
dust
and
for
the
selfsame
end
hath
he
created
them
that
they
should
keep
his
commandments
and
glorify
him
forever

and
now
i
make
an
end
of
speaking
unto
you
concerning
this
pride
and
were
it
not
that
i
must
speak
unto
you
concerning
a
grosser
crime
my
heart
would
rejoice
exceedingly
because
of
you

but
the
word
of
god
burdens
me
because
of
your
grosser
crimes
for
behold
thus
saith
the
lord
this
people
begin
to
wax
in
iniquity
they
understand
not
the
scriptures
for
they
seek
to
excuse
themselves
in
committing
whoredoms
because
of
the
things
which
were
written
concerning
david
and
solomon
his
son

behold
david
and
solomon
truly
had
many
wives
and
concubines
which
thing
was
abominable
before
me
saith
the
lord

wherefore
thus
saith
the
lord
i
have
led
this
people
forth
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
by
the
power
of
mine
arm
that
i
might
raise
up
unto
me
a
righteous
branch
from
the
fruit
of
the
loins
of
joseph

wherefore
i
the
lord
god
will
not
suffer
that
this
people
shall
do
like
unto
them
of
old

wherefore
my
brethren
hear
me
and
hearken
to
the
word
of
the
lord
for
there
shall
not
any
man
among
you
have
save
it
be
one
wife
and
concubines
he
shall
have
none

for
i
the
lord
god
delight
in
the
chastity
of
women
and
whoredoms
are
an
abomination
before
me
thus
saith
the
lord
of
hosts

wherefore
this
people
shall
keep
my
commandments
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
or
cursed
be
the
land
for
their
sakes

for
if
i
will
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
raise
up
seed
unto
me
i
will
command
my
people
otherwise
they
shall
hearken
unto
these
things

for
behold
i
the
lord
have
seen
the
sorrow
and
heard
the
mourning
of
the
daughters
of
my
people
in
the
land
of
jerusalem
yea
and
in
all
the
lands
of
my
people
because
of
the
wickedness
and
abominations
of
their
husbands

and
i
will
not
suffer
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
that
the
cries
of
the
fair
daughters
of
this
people
which
i
have
led
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
shall
come
up
unto
me
against
the
men
of
my
people
saith
the
lord
of
hosts

for
they
shall
not
lead
away
captive
the
daughters
of
my
people
because
of
their
tenderness
save
i
shall
visit
them
with
a
sore
curse
even
unto
destruction
for
they
shall
not
commit
whoredoms
like
unto
them
of
old
saith
the
lord
of
hosts

and
now
behold
my
brethren
ye
know
that
these
commandments
were
given
to
our
father
lehi
wherefore
ye
have
known
them
before
and
ye
have
come
unto
great
condemnation
for
ye
have
done
these
things
which
ye
ought
not
to
have
done

behold
ye
have
done
greater
iniquities
than
the
lamanites
our
brethren
ye
have
broken
the
hearts
of
your
tender
wives
and
lost
the
confidence
of
your
children
because
of
your
bad
examples
before
them
and
the
sobbings
of
their
hearts
ascend
up
to
god
against
you
and
because
of
the
strictness
of
the
word
of
god
which
cometh
down
against
you
many
hearts
died
pierced
with
deep
wounds
jacob
chapter


but
behold
i
jacob
would
speak
unto
you
that
are
pure
in
heart
look
unto
god
with
firmness
of
mind
and
pray
unto
him
with
exceeding
faith
and
he
will
console
you
in
your
afflictions
and
he
will
plead
your
cause
and
send
down
justice
upon
those
who
seek
your
destruction

o
all
ye
that
are
pure
in
heart
lift
up
your
heads
and
receive
the
pleasing
word
of
god
and
feast
upon
his
love
for
ye
may
if
your
minds
are
firm
forever

but
wo
wo
unto
you
that
are
not
pure
in
heart
that
are
filthy
this
day
before
god
for
except
ye
repent
the
land
is
cursed
for
your
sakes
and
the
lamanites
which
are
not
filthy
like
unto
you
nevertheless
they
are
cursed
with
a
sore
cursing
shall
scourge
you
even
unto
destruction

and
the
time
speedily
cometh
that
except
ye
repent
they
shall
possess
the
land
of
your
inheritance
and
the
lord
god
will
lead
away
the
righteous
out
from
among
you

behold
the
lamanites
your
brethren
whom
ye
hate
because
of
their
filthiness
and
the
cursing
which
hath
come
upon
their
skins
are
more
righteous
than
you
for
they
have
not
forgotten
the
commandment
of
the
lord
which
was
given
unto
our
fatherthat
they
should
have
save
it
were
one
wife
and
concubines
they
should
have
none
and
there
should
not
be
whoredoms
committed
among
them

and
now
this
commandment
they
observe
to
keep
wherefore
because
of
this
observance
in
keeping
this
commandment
the
lord
god
will
not
destroy
them
but
will
be
merciful
unto
them
and
one
day
they
shall
become
a
blessed
people

behold
their
husbands
love
their
wives
and
their
wives
love
their
husbands
and
their
husbands
and
their
wives
love
their
children
and
their
unbelief
and
their
hatred
towards
you
is
because
of
the
iniquity
of
their
fathers
wherefore
how
much
better
are
you
than
they
in
the
sight
of
your
great
creator

o
my
brethren
i
fear
that
unless
ye
shall
repent
of
your
sins
that
their
skins
will
be
whiter
than
yours
when
ye
shall
be
brought
with
them
before
the
throne
of
god

wherefore
a
commandment
i
give
unto
you
which
is
the
word
of
god
that
ye
revile
no
more
against
them
because
of
the
darkness
of
their
skins
neither
shall
ye
revile
against
them
because
of
their
filthiness
but
ye
shall
remember
your
own
filthiness
and
remember
that
their
filthiness
came
because
of
their
fathers

wherefore
ye
shall
remember
your
children
how
that
ye
have
grieved
their
hearts
because
of
the
example
that
ye
have
set
before
them
and
also
remember
that
ye
may
because
of
your
filthiness
bring
your
children
unto
destruction
and
their
sins
be
heaped
upon
your
heads
at
the
last
day

o
my
brethren
hearken
unto
my
words
arouse
the
faculties
of
your
souls
shake
yourselves
that
ye
may
awake
from
the
slumber
of
death
and
loose
yourselves
from
the
pains
of
hell
that
ye
may
not
become
angels
to
the
devil
to
be
cast
into
that
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
which
is
the
second
death

and
now
i
jacob
spake
many
more
things
unto
the
people
of
nephi
warning
them
against
fornication
and
lasciviousness
and
every
kind
of
sin
telling
them
the
awful
consequences
of
them

and
a
hundredth
part
of
the
proceedings
of
this
people
which
now
began
to
be
numerous
cannot
be
written
upon
these
plates
but
many
of
their
proceedings
are
written
upon
the
larger
plates
and
their
wars
and
their
contentions
and
the
reigns
of
their
kings

these
plates
are
called
the
plates
of
jacob
and
they
were
made
by
the
hand
of
nephi
and
i
make
an
end
of
speaking
these
words
jacob
chapter


now
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
i
jacob
having
ministered
much
unto
my
people
in
word
and
i
cannot
write
but
a
little
of
my
words
because
of
the
difficulty
of
engraving
our
words
upon
plates
and
we
know
that
the
things
which
we
write
upon
plates
must
remain

but
whatsoever
things
we
write
upon
anything
save
it
be
upon
plates
must
perish
and
vanish
away
but
we
can
write
a
few
words
upon
plates
which
will
give
our
children
and
also
our
beloved
brethren
a
small
degree
of
knowledge
concerning
us
or
concerning
their
fathers

now
in
this
thing
we
do
rejoice
and
we
labor
diligently
to
engraven
these
words
upon
plates
hoping
that
our
beloved
brethren
and
our
children
will
receive
them
with
thankful
hearts
and
look
upon
them
that
they
may
learn
with
joy
and
not
with
sorrow
neither
with
contempt
concerning
their
first
parents

for
for
this
intent
have
we
written
these
things
that
they
may
know
that
we
knew
of
christ
and
we
had
a
hope
of
his
glory
many
hundred
years
before
his
coming
and
not
only
we
ourselves
had
a
hope
of
his
glory
but
also
all
the
holy
prophets
which
were
before
us

behold
they
believed
in
christ
and
worshiped
the
father
in
his
name
and
also
we
worship
the
father
in
his
name
and
for
this
intent
we
keep
the
law
of
moses
it
pointing
our
souls
to
him
and
for
this
cause
it
is
sanctified
unto
us
for
righteousness
even
as
it
was
accounted
unto
abraham
in
the
wilderness
to
be
obedient
unto
the
commands
of
god
in
offering
up
his
son
isaac
which
is
a
similitude
of
god
and
his
only
begotten
son

wherefore
we
search
the
prophets
and
we
have
many
revelations
and
the
spirit
of
prophecy
and
having
all
these
witnesses
we
obtain
a
hope
and
our
faith
becometh
unshaken
insomuch
that
we
truly
can
command
in
the
name
of
jesus
and
the
very
trees
obey
us
or
the
mountains
or
the
waves
of
the
sea

nevertheless
the
lord
god
showeth
us
our
weakness
that
we
may
know
that
it
is
by
his
grace
and
his
great
condescensions
unto
the
children
of
men
that
we
have
power
to
do
these
things

behold
great
and
marvelous
are
the
works
of
the
lord
how
unsearchable
are
the
depths
of
the
mysteries
of
him
and
it
is
impossible
that
man
should
find
out
all
his
ways
and
no
man
knoweth
of
his
ways
save
it
be
revealed
unto
him
wherefore
brethren
despise
not
the
revelations
of
god

for
behold
by
the
power
of
his
word
man
came
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
which
earth
was
created
by
the
power
of
his
word
wherefore
if
god
being
able
to
speak
and
the
world
was
and
to
speak
and
man
was
created
o
then
why
not
able
to
command
the
earth
or
the
workmanship
of
his
hands
upon
the
face
of
it
according
to
his
will
and
pleasure

wherefore
brethren
seek
not
to
counsel
the
lord
but
to
take
counsel
from
his
hand
for
behold
ye
yourselves
know
that
he
counseleth
in
wisdom
and
in
justice
and
in
great
mercy
over
all
his
works

wherefore
beloved
brethren
be
reconciled
unto
him
through
the
atonement
of
christ
his
only
begotten
son
and
ye
may
obtain
a
resurrection
according
to
the
power
of
the
resurrection
which
is
in
christ
and
be
presented
as
the
firstfruits
of
christ
unto
god
having
faith
and
obtained
a
good
hope
of
glory
in
him
before
he
manifesteth
himself
in
the
flesh

and
now
beloved
marvel
not
that
i
tell
you
these
things
for
why
not
speak
of
the
atonement
of
christ
and
attain
to
a
perfect
knowledge
of
him
as
to
attain
to
the
knowledge
of
a
resurrection
and
the
world
to
come

behold
my
brethren
he
that
prophesieth
let
him
prophesy
to
the
understanding
of
men
for
the
spirit
speaketh
the
truth
and
lieth
not
wherefore
it
speaketh
of
things
as
they
really
are
and
of
things
as
they
really
will
be
wherefore
these
things
are
manifested
unto
us
plainly
for
the
salvation
of
our
souls
but
behold
we
are
not
witnesses
alone
in
these
things
for
god
also
spake
them
unto
prophets
of
old

but
behold
the
jews
were
a
stiffnecked
people
and
they
despised
the
words
of
plainness
and
killed
the
prophets
and
sought
for
things
that
they
could
not
understand
wherefore
because
of
their
blindness
which
blindness
came
by
looking
beyond
the
mark
they
must
needs
fall
for
god
hath
taken
away
his
plainness
from
them
and
delivered
unto
them
many
things
which
they
cannot
understand
because
they
desired
it
and
because
they
desired
it
god
hath
done
it
that
they
may
stumble

and
now
i
jacob
am
led
on
by
the
spirit
unto
prophesying
for
i
perceive
by
the
workings
of
the
spirit
which
is
in
me
that
by
the
stumbling
of
the
jews
they
will
reject
the
stone
upon
which
they
might
build
and
have
safe
foundation

but
behold
according
to
the
scriptures
this
stone
shall
become
the
great
and
the
last
and
the
only
sure
foundation
upon
which
the
jews
can
build

and
now
my
beloved
how
is
it
possible
that
these
after
having
rejected
the
sure
foundation
can
ever
build
upon
it
that
it
may
become
the
head
of
their
corner

behold
my
beloved
brethren
i
will
unfold
this
mystery
unto
you
if
i
do
not
by
any
means
get
shaken
from
my
firmness
in
the
spirit
and
stumble
because
of
my
over
anxiety
for
you

chapter


behold
my
brethren
do
ye
not
remember
to
have
read
the
words
of
the
prophet
zenos
which
he
spake
unto
the
house
of
israel
saying

hearken
o
ye
house
of
israel
and
hear
the
words
of
me
a
prophet
of
the
lord

for
behold
thus
saith
the
lord
i
will
liken
thee
o
house
of
israel
like
unto
a
tame
olivetree
which
a
man
took
and
nourished
in
his
vineyard
and
it
grew
and
waxed
old
and
began
to
decay

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
master
of
the
vineyard
went
forth
and
he
saw
that
his
olivetree
began
to
decay
and
he
said
i
will
prune
it
and
dig
about
it
and
nourish
it
that
perhaps
it
may
shoot
forth
young
and
tender
branches
and
it
perish
not

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
pruned
it
and
digged
about
it
and
nourished
it
according
to
his
word

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
many
days
it
began
to
put
forth
somewhat
a
little
young
and
tender
branches
but
behold
the
main
top
thereof
began
to
perish

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
master
of
the
vineyard
saw
it
and
he
said
unto
his
servant
it
grieveth
me
that
i
should
lose
this
tree
wherefore
go
and
pluck
the
branches
from
a
wild
olivetree
and
bring
them
hither
unto
me
and
we
will
pluck
off
those
main
branches
which
are
beginning
to
wither
away
and
we
will
cast
them
into
the
fire
that
they
may
be
burned

and
behold
saith
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
i
take
away
many
of
these
young
and
tender
branches
and
i
will
graft
them
whithersoever
i
will
and
it
mattereth
not
that
if
it
so
be
that
the
root
of
this
tree
will
perish
i
may
preserve
the
fruit
thereof
unto
myself
wherefore
i
will
take
these
young
and
tender
branches
and
i
will
graft
them
whithersoever
i
will

take
thou
the
branches
of
the
wild
olivetree
and
graft
them
in
in
the
stead
thereof
and
these
which
i
have
plucked
off
i
will
cast
into
the
fire
and
burn
them
that
they
may
not
cumber
the
ground
of
my
vineyard

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
servant
of
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
did
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
and
grafted
in
the
branches
of
the
wild
olivetree

and
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
caused
that
it
should
be
digged
about
and
pruned
and
nourished
saying
unto
his
servant
it
grieveth
me
that
i
should
lose
this
tree
wherefore
that
perhaps
i
might
preserve
the
roots
thereof
that
they
perish
not
that
i
might
preserve
them
unto
myself
i
have
done
this
thing

wherefore
go
thy
way
watch
the
tree
and
nourish
it
according
to
my
words

and
these
will
i
place
in
the
nethermost
part
of
my
vineyard
whithersoever
i
will
it
mattereth
not
unto
thee
and
i
do
it
that
i
may
preserve
unto
myself
the
natural
branches
of
the
tree
and
also
that
i
may
lay
up
fruit
thereof
against
the
season
unto
myself
for
it
grieveth
me
that
i
should
lose
this
tree
and
the
fruit
thereof

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
went
his
way
and
hid
the
natural
branches
of
the
tame
olivetree
in
the
nethermost
parts
of
the
vineyard
some
in
one
and
some
in
another
according
to
his
will
and
pleasure

and
it
came
to
pass
that
a
long
time
passed
away
and
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
said
unto
his
servant
come
let
us
go
down
into
the
vineyard
that
we
may
labor
in
the
vineyard

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
and
also
the
servant
went
down
into
the
vineyard
to
labor
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
servant
said
unto
his
master
behold
look
here
behold
the
tree

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
looked
and
beheld
the
tree
in
the
which
the
wild
olive
branches
had
been
grafted
and
it
had
sprung
forth
and
begun
to
bear
fruit
and
he
beheld
that
it
was
good
and
the
fruit
thereof
was
like
unto
the
natural
fruit

and
he
said
unto
the
servant
behold
the
branches
of
the
wild
tree
have
taken
hold
of
the
moisture
of
the
root
thereof
that
the
root
thereof
hath
brought
forth
much
strength
and
because
of
the
much
strength
of
the
root
thereof
the
wild
branches
have
brought
forth
tame
fruit
now
if
we
had
not
grafted
in
these
branches
the
tree
thereof
would
have
perished
and
now
behold
i
shall
lay
up
much
fruit
which
the
tree
thereof
hath
brought
forth
and
the
fruit
thereof
i
shall
lay
up
against
the
season
unto
mine
own
self

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
said
unto
the
servant
come
let
us
go
to
the
nethermost
part
of
the
vineyard
and
behold
if
the
natural
branches
of
the
tree
have
not
brought
forth
much
fruit
also
that
i
may
lay
up
of
the
fruit
thereof
against
the
season
unto
mine
own
self

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
forth
whither
the
master
had
hid
the
natural
branches
of
the
tree
and
he
said
unto
the
servant
behold
these
and
he
beheld
the
first
that
it
had
brought
forth
much
fruit
and
he
beheld
also
that
it
was
good
and
he
said
unto
the
servant
take
of
the
fruit
thereof
and
lay
it
up
against
the
season
that
i
may
preserve
it
unto
mine
own
self
for
behold
said
he
this
long
time
have
i
nourished
it
and
it
hath
brought
forth
much
fruit

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
servant
said
unto
his
master
how
comest
thou
hither
to
plant
this
tree
or
this
branch
of
the
tree
for
behold
it
was
the
poorest
spot
in
all
the
land
of
thy
vineyard

and
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
said
unto
him
counsel
me
not
i
knew
that
it
was
a
poor
spot
of
ground
wherefore
i
said
unto
thee
i
have
nourished
it
this
long
time
and
thou
beholdest
that
it
hath
brought
forth
much
fruit

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
said
unto
his
servant
look
hither
behold
i
have
planted
another
branch
of
the
tree
also
and
thou
knowest
that
this
spot
of
ground
was
poorer
than
the
first
but
behold
the
tree
i
have
nourished
it
this
long
time
and
it
hath
brought
forth
much
fruit
therefore
gather
it
and
lay
it
up
against
the
season
that
i
may
preserve
it
unto
mine
own
self

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
said
again
unto
his
servant
look
hither
and
behold
another
branch
also
which
i
have
planted
behold
that
i
have
nourished
it
also
and
it
hath
brought
forth
fruit

and
he
said
unto
the
servant
look
hither
and
behold
the
last
behold
this
have
i
planted
in
a
good
spot
of
ground
and
i
have
nourished
it
this
long
time
and
only
a
part
of
the
tree
hath
brought
forth
tame
fruit
and
the
other
part
of
the
tree
hath
brought
forth
wild
fruit
behold
i
have
nourished
this
tree
like
unto
the
others

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
said
unto
the
servant
pluck
off
the
branches
that
have
not
brought
forth
good
fruit
and
cast
them
into
the
fire

but
behold
the
servant
said
unto
him
let
us
prune
it
and
dig
about
it
and
nourish
it
a
little
longer
that
perhaps
it
may
bring
forth
good
fruit
unto
thee
that
thou
canst
lay
it
up
against
the
season

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
and
the
servant
of
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
did
nourish
all
the
fruit
of
the
vineyard

and
it
came
to
pass
that
a
long
time
had
passed
away
and
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
said
unto
his
servant
come
let
us
go
down
into
the
vineyard
that
we
may
labor
again
in
the
vineyard
for
behold
the
time
draweth
near
and
the
end
soon
cometh
wherefore
i
must
lay
up
fruit
against
the
season
unto
mine
own
self

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
and
the
servant
went
down
into
the
vineyard
and
they
came
to
the
tree
whose
natural
branches
had
been
broken
off
and
the
wild
branches
had
been
grafted
in
and
behold
all
sorts
of
fruit
did
cumber
the
tree

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
did
taste
of
the
fruit
every
sort
according
to
its
number
and
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
said
behold
this
long
time
have
we
nourished
this
tree
and
i
have
laid
up
unto
myself
against
the
season
much
fruit

but
behold
this
time
it
hath
brought
forth
much
fruit
and
there
is
none
of
it
which
is
good
and
behold
there
are
all
kinds
of
bad
fruit
and
it
profiteth
me
nothing
notwithstanding
all
our
labor
and
now
it
grieveth
me
that
i
should
lose
this
tree

and
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
said
unto
the
servant
what
shall
we
do
unto
the
tree
that
i
may
preserve
again
good
fruit
thereof
unto
mine
own
self

and
the
servant
said
unto
his
master
behold
because
thou
didst
graft
in
the
branches
of
the
wild
olivetree
they
have
nourished
the
roots
that
they
are
alive
and
they
have
not
perished
wherefore
thou
beholdest
that
they
are
yet
good

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
said
unto
his
servant
the
tree
profiteth
me
nothing
and
the
roots
thereof
profit
me
nothing
so
long
as
it
shall
bring
forth
evil
fruit

nevertheless
i
know
that
the
roots
are
good
and
for
mine
own
purpose
i
have
preserved
them
and
because
of
their
much
strength
they
have
hitherto
brought
forth
from
the
wild
branches
good
fruit

but
behold
the
wild
branches
have
grown
and
have
overrun
the
roots
thereof
and
because
that
the
wild
branches
have
overcome
the
roots
thereof
it
hath
brought
forth
much
evil
fruit
and
because
that
it
hath
brought
forth
so
much
evil
fruit
thou
beholdest
that
it
beginneth
to
perish
and
it
will
soon
become
ripened
that
it
may
be
cast
into
the
fire
except
we
should
do
something
for
it
to
preserve
it

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
said
unto
his
servant
let
us
go
down
into
the
nethermost
parts
of
the
vineyard
and
behold
if
the
natural
branches
have
also
brought
forth
evil
fruit

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
down
into
the
nethermost
parts
of
the
vineyard
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
beheld
that
the
fruit
of
the
natural
branches
had
become
corrupt
also
yea
the
first
and
the
second
and
also
the
last
and
they
had
all
become
corrupt

and
the
wild
fruit
of
the
last
had
overcome
that
part
of
the
tree
which
brought
forth
good
fruit
even
that
the
branch
had
withered
away
and
died

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
wept
and
said
unto
the
servant
what
could
i
have
done
more
for
my
vineyard

behold
i
knew
that
all
the
fruit
of
the
vineyard
save
it
were
these
had
become
corrupted
and
now
these
which
have
once
brought
forth
good
fruit
have
also
become
corrupted
and
now
all
the
trees
of
my
vineyard
are
good
for
nothing
save
it
be
to
be
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire

and
behold
this
last
whose
branch
hath
withered
away
i
did
plant
in
a
good
spot
of
ground
yea
even
that
which
was
choice
unto
me
above
all
other
parts
of
the
land
of
my
vineyard

and
thou
beheldest
that
i
also
cut
down
that
which
cumbered
this
spot
of
ground
that
i
might
plant
this
tree
in
the
stead
thereof

and
thou
beheldest
that
a
part
thereof
brought
forth
good
fruit
and
a
part
thereof
brought
forth
wild
fruit
and
because
i
plucked
not
the
branches
thereof
and
cast
them
into
the
fire
behold
they
have
overcome
the
good
branch
that
it
hath
withered
away

and
now
behold
notwithstanding
all
the
care
which
we
have
taken
of
my
vineyard
the
trees
thereof
have
become
corrupted
that
they
bring
forth
no
good
fruit
and
these
i
had
hoped
to
preserve
to
have
laid
up
fruit
thereof
against
the
season
unto
mine
own
self
but
behold
they
have
become
like
unto
the
wild
olivetree
and
they
are
of
no
worth
but
to
be
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
and
it
grieveth
me
that
i
should
lose
them

but
what
could
i
have
done
more
in
my
vineyard
have
i
slackened
mine
hand
that
i
have
not
nourished
it
nay
i
have
nourished
it
and
i
have
digged
about
it
and
i
have
pruned
it
and
i
have
dunged
it
and
i
have
stretched
forth
mine
hand
almost
all
the
day
long
and
the
end
draweth
nigh
and
it
grieveth
me
that
i
should
hew
down
all
the
trees
of
my
vineyard
and
cast
them
into
the
fire
that
they
should
be
burned
who
is
it
that
has
corrupted
my
vineyard

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
servant
said
unto
his
master
is
it
not
the
loftiness
of
thy
vineyardhave
not
the
branches
thereof
overcome
the
roots
which
are
good
and
because
the
branches
have
overcome
the
roots
thereof
behold
they
grew
faster
than
the
strength
of
the
roots
taking
strength
unto
themselves
behold
i
say
is
not
this
the
cause
that
the
trees
of
thy
vineyard
have
become
corrupted

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
said
unto
the
servant
let
us
go
to
and
hew
down
the
trees
of
the
vineyard
and
cast
them
into
the
fire
that
they
shall
not
cumber
the
ground
of
my
vineyard
for
i
have
done
all
what
could
i
have
done
more
for
my
vineyard

but
behold
the
servant
said
unto
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
spare
it
a
little
longer

and
the
lord
said
yea
i
will
spare
it
a
little
longer
for
it
grieveth
me
that
i
should
lose
the
trees
of
my
vineyard

wherefore
let
us
take
of
the
branches
of
these
which
i
have
planted
in
the
nethermost
parts
of
my
vineyard
and
let
us
graft
them
into
the
tree
from
whence
they
came
and
let
us
pluck
from
the
tree
those
branches
whose
fruit
is
most
bitter
and
graft
in
the
natural
branches
of
the
tree
in
the
stead
thereof

and
this
will
i
do
that
the
tree
may
not
perish
that
perhaps
i
may
preserve
unto
myself
the
roots
thereof
for
mine
own
purpose

and
behold
the
roots
of
the
natural
branches
of
the
tree
which
i
planted
whithersoever
i
would
are
yet
alive
wherefore
that
i
may
preserve
them
also
for
mine
own
purpose
i
will
take
of
the
branches
of
this
tree
and
i
will
graft
them
in
unto
them
yea
i
will
graft
in
unto
them
the
branches
of
their
mother
tree
that
i
may
preserve
the
roots
also
unto
mine
own
self
that
when
they
shall
be
sufficiently
strong
perhaps
they
may
bring
forth
good
fruit
unto
me
and
i
may
yet
have
glory
in
the
fruit
of
my
vineyard

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
took
from
the
natural
tree
which
had
become
wild
and
grafted
in
unto
the
natural
trees
which
also
had
become
wild

and
they
also
took
of
the
natural
trees
which
had
become
wild
and
grafted
into
their
mother
tree

and
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
said
unto
the
servant
pluck
not
the
wild
branches
from
the
trees
save
it
be
those
which
are
most
bitter
and
in
them
ye
shall
graft
according
to
that
which
i
have
said

and
we
will
nourish
again
the
trees
of
the
vineyard
and
we
will
trim
up
the
branches
thereof
and
we
will
pluck
from
the
trees
those
branches
which
are
ripened
that
must
perish
and
cast
them
into
the
fire

and
this
i
do
that
perhaps
the
roots
thereof
may
take
strength
because
of
their
goodness
and
because
of
the
change
of
the
branches
that
the
good
may
overcome
the
evil

and
because
that
i
have
preserved
the
natural
branches
and
the
roots
thereof
and
that
i
have
grafted
in
the
natural
branches
again
into
their
mother
tree
and
have
preserved
the
roots
of
their
mother
tree
that
perhaps
the
trees
of
my
vineyard
may
bring
forth
again
good
fruit
and
that
i
may
have
joy
again
in
the
fruit
of
my
vineyard
and
perhaps
that
i
may
rejoice
exceedingly
that
i
have
preserved
the
roots
and
the
branches
of
the
first
fruit

wherefore
go
to
and
call
servants
that
we
may
labor
diligently
with
our
might
in
the
vineyard
that
we
may
prepare
the
way
that
i
may
bring
forth
again
the
natural
fruit
which
natural
fruit
is
good
and
the
most
precious
above
all
other
fruit

wherefore
let
us
go
to
and
labor
with
our
might
this
last
time
for
behold
the
end
draweth
nigh
and
this
is
for
the
last
time
that
i
shall
prune
my
vineyard

graft
in
the
branches
begin
at
the
last
that
they
may
be
first
and
that
the
first
may
be
last
and
dig
about
the
trees
both
old
and
young
the
first
and
the
last
and
the
last
and
the
first
that
all
may
be
nourished
once
again
for
the
last
time

wherefore
dig
about
them
and
prune
them
and
dung
them
once
more
for
the
last
time
for
the
end
draweth
nigh
and
if
it
be
so
that
these
last
grafts
shall
grow
and
bring
forth
the
natural
fruit
then
shall
ye
prepare
the
way
for
them
that
they
may
grow

and
as
they
begin
to
grow
ye
shall
clear
away
the
branches
which
bring
forth
bitter
fruit
according
to
the
strength
of
the
good
and
the
size
thereof
and
ye
shall
not
clear
away
the
bad
thereof
all
at
once
lest
the
roots
thereof
should
be
too
strong
for
the
graft
and
the
graft
thereof
shall
perish
and
i
lose
the
trees
of
my
vineyard

for
it
grieveth
me
that
i
should
lose
the
trees
of
my
vineyard
wherefore
ye
shall
clear
away
the
bad
according
as
the
good
shall
grow
that
the
root
and
the
top
may
be
equal
in
strength
until
the
good
shall
overcome
the
bad
and
the
bad
be
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
that
they
cumber
not
the
ground
of
my
vineyard
and
thus
will
i
sweep
away
the
bad
out
of
my
vineyard

and
the
branches
of
the
natural
tree
will
i
graft
in
again
into
the
natural
tree

and
the
branches
of
the
natural
tree
will
i
graft
into
the
natural
branches
of
the
tree
and
thus
will
i
bring
them
together
again
that
they
shall
bring
forth
the
natural
fruit
and
they
shall
be
one

and
the
bad
shall
be
cast
away
yea
even
out
of
all
the
land
of
my
vineyard
for
behold
only
this
once
will
i
prune
my
vineyard

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
sent
his
servant
and
the
servant
went
and
did
as
the
lord
had
commanded
him
and
brought
other
servants
and
they
were
few

and
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
said
unto
them
go
to
and
labor
in
the
vineyard
with
your
might
for
behold
this
is
the
last
time
that
i
shall
nourish
my
vineyard
for
the
end
is
nigh
at
hand
and
the
season
speedily
cometh
and
if
ye
labor
with
your
might
with
me
ye
shall
have
joy
in
the
fruit
which
i
shall
lay
up
unto
myself
against
the
time
which
will
soon
come

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
servants
did
go
and
labor
with
their
mights
and
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
labored
also
with
them
and
they
did
obey
the
commandments
of
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
in
all
things

and
there
began
to
be
the
natural
fruit
again
in
the
vineyard
and
the
natural
branches
began
to
grow
and
thrive
exceedingly
and
the
wild
branches
began
to
be
plucked
off
and
to
be
cast
away
and
they
did
keep
the
root
and
the
top
thereof
equal
according
to
the
strength
thereof

and
thus
they
labored
with
all
diligence
according
to
the
commandments
of
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
even
until
the
bad
had
been
cast
away
out
of
the
vineyard
and
the
lord
had
preserved
unto
himself
that
the
trees
had
become
again
the
natural
fruit
and
they
became
like
unto
one
body
and
the
fruits
were
equal
and
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
had
preserved
unto
himself
the
natural
fruit
which
was
most
precious
unto
him
from
the
beginning

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
saw
that
his
fruit
was
good
and
that
his
vineyard
was
no
more
corrupt
he
called
up
his
servants
and
said
unto
them
behold
for
this
last
time
have
we
nourished
my
vineyard
and
thou
beholdest
that
i
have
done
according
to
my
will
and
i
have
preserved
the
natural
fruit
that
it
is
good
even
like
as
it
was
in
the
beginning
and
blessed
art
thou
for
because
ye
have
been
diligent
in
laboring
with
me
in
my
vineyard
and
have
kept
my
commandments
and
have
brought
unto
me
again
the
natural
fruit
that
my
vineyard
is
no
more
corrupted
and
the
bad
is
cast
away
behold
ye
shall
have
joy
with
me
because
of
the
fruit
of
my
vineyard

for
behold
for
a
long
time
will
i
lay
up
of
the
fruit
of
my
vineyard
unto
mine
own
self
against
the
season
which
speedily
cometh
and
for
the
last
time
have
i
nourished
my
vineyard
and
pruned
it
and
dug
about
it
and
dunged
it
wherefore
i
will
lay
up
unto
mine
own
self
of
the
fruit
for
a
long
time
according
to
that
which
i
have
spoken

and
when
the
time
cometh
that
evil
fruit
shall
again
come
into
my
vineyard
then
will
i
cause
the
good
and
the
bad
to
be
gathered
and
the
good
will
i
preserve
unto
myself
and
the
bad
will
i
cast
away
into
its
own
place
and
then
cometh
the
season
and
the
end
and
my
vineyard
will
i
cause
to
be
burned
with
fire
jacob
chapter


and
now
behold
my
brethren
as
i
said
unto
you
that
i
would
prophesy
behold
this
is
my
prophecythat
the
things
which
this
prophet
zenos
spake
concerning
the
house
of
israel
in
the
which
he
likened
them
unto
a
tame
olivetree
must
surely
come
to
pass

and
the
day
that
he
shall
set
his
hand
again
the
second
time
to
recover
his
people
is
the
day
yea
even
the
last
time
that
the
servants
of
the
lord
shall
go
forth
in
his
power
to
nourish
and
prune
his
vineyard
and
after
that
the
end
soon
cometh

and
how
blessed
are
they
who
have
labored
diligently
in
his
vineyard
and
how
cursed
are
they
who
shall
be
cast
out
into
their
own
place
and
the
world
shall
be
burned
with
fire

and
how
merciful
is
our
god
unto
us
for
he
remembereth
the
house
of
israel
both
roots
and
branches
and
he
stretches
forth
his
hands
unto
them
all
the
day
long
and
they
are
a
stiffnecked
and
a
gainsaying
people
but
as
many
as
will
not
harden
their
hearts
shall
be
saved
in
the
kingdom
of
god

wherefore
my
beloved
brethren
i
beseech
of
you
in
words
of
soberness
that
ye
would
repent
and
come
with
full
purpose
of
heart
and
cleave
unto
god
as
he
cleaveth
unto
you
and
while
his
arm
of
mercy
is
extended
towards
you
in
the
light
of
the
day
harden
not
your
hearts

yea
today
if
ye
will
hear
his
voice
harden
not
your
hearts
for
why
will
ye
die

for
behold
after
ye
have
been
nourished
by
the
good
word
of
god
all
the
day
long
will
ye
bring
forth
evil
fruit
that
ye
must
be
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire

behold
will
ye
reject
these
words
will
ye
reject
the
words
of
the
prophets
and
will
ye
reject
all
the
words
which
have
been
spoken
concerning
christ
after
so
many
have
spoken
concerning
him
and
deny
the
good
word
of
christ
and
the
power
of
god
and
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
and
quench
the
holy
spirit
and
make
a
mock
of
the
great
plan
of
redemption
which
hath
been
laid
for
you

know
ye
not
that
if
ye
will
do
these
things
that
the
power
of
the
redemption
and
the
resurrection
which
is
in
christ
will
bring
you
to
stand
with
shame
and
awful
guilt
before
the
bar
of
god

and
according
to
the
power
of
justice
for
justice
cannot
be
denied
ye
must
go
away
into
that
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
whose
flames
are
unquenchable
and
whose
smoke
ascendeth
up
forever
and
ever
which
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
is
endless
torment

o
then
my
beloved
brethren
repent
ye
and
enter
in
at
the
strait
gate
and
continue
in
the
way
which
is
narrow
until
ye
shall
obtain
eternal
life

o
be
wise
what
can
i
say
more

finally
i
bid
you
farewell
until
i
shall
meet
you
before
the
pleasing
bar
of
god
which
bar
striketh
the
wicked
with
awful
dread
and
fear
amen
jacob
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
after
some
years
had
passed
away
there
came
a
man
among
the
people
of
nephi
whose
name
was
sherem

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
began
to
preach
among
the
people
and
to
declare
unto
them
that
there
should
be
no
christ
and
he
preached
many
things
which
were
flattering
unto
the
people
and
this
he
did
that
he
might
overthrow
the
doctrine
of
christ

and
he
labored
diligently
that
he
might
lead
away
the
hearts
of
the
people
insomuch
that
he
did
lead
away
many
hearts
and
he
knowing
that
i
jacob
had
faith
in
christ
who
should
come
he
sought
much
opportunity
that
he
might
come
unto
me

and
he
was
learned
that
he
had
a
perfect
knowledge
of
the
language
of
the
people
wherefore
he
could
use
much
flattery
and
much
power
of
speech
according
to
the
power
of
the
devil

and
he
had
hope
to
shake
me
from
the
faith
notwithstanding
the
many
revelations
and
the
many
things
which
i
had
seen
concerning
these
things
for
i
truly
had
seen
angels
and
they
had
ministered
unto
me
and
also
i
had
heard
the
voice
of
the
lord
speaking
unto
me
in
very
word
from
time
to
time
wherefore
i
could
not
be
shaken

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
came
unto
me
and
on
this
wise
did
he
speak
unto
me
saying
brother
jacob
i
have
sought
much
opportunity
that
i
might
speak
unto
you
for
i
have
heard
and
also
know
that
thou
goest
about
much
preaching
that
which
ye
call
the
gospel
or
the
doctrine
of
christ

and
ye
have
led
away
much
of
this
people
that
they
pervert
the
right
way
of
god
and
keep
not
the
law
of
moses
which
is
the
right
way
and
convert
the
law
of
moses
into
the
worship
of
a
being
which
ye
say
shall
come
many
hundred
years
hence
and
now
behold
i
sherem
declare
unto
you
that
this
is
blasphemy
for
no
man
knoweth
of
such
things
for
he
cannot
tell
of
things
to
come
and
after
this
manner
did
sherem
contend
against
me

but
behold
the
lord
god
poured
in
his
spirit
into
my
soul
insomuch
that
i
did
confound
him
in
all
his
words

and
i
said
unto
him
deniest
thou
the
christ
who
shall
come
and
he
said
if
there
should
be
a
christ
i
would
not
deny
him
but
i
know
that
there
is
no
christ
neither
has
been
nor
ever
will
be

and
i
said
unto
him
believest
thou
the
scriptures
and
he
said
yea

and
i
said
unto
him
then
ye
do
not
understand
them
for
they
truly
testify
of
christ
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
none
of
the
prophets
have
written
nor
prophesied
save
they
have
spoken
concerning
this
christ

and
this
is
not
allit
has
been
made
manifest
unto
me
for
i
have
heard
and
seen
and
it
also
has
been
made
manifest
unto
me
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
wherefore
i
know
if
there
should
be
no
atonement
made
all
mankind
must
be
lost

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
unto
me
show
me
a
sign
by
this
power
of
the
holy
ghost
in
the
which
ye
know
so
much

and
i
said
unto
him
what
am
i
that
i
should
tempt
god
to
show
unto
thee
a
sign
in
the
thing
which
thou
knowest
to
be
true
yet
thou
wilt
deny
it
because
thou
art
of
the
devil
nevertheless
not
my
will
be
done
but
if
god
shall
smite
thee
let
that
be
a
sign
unto
thee
that
he
has
power
both
in
heaven
and
in
earth
and
also
that
christ
shall
come
and
thy
will
o
lord
be
done
and
not
mine

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
i
jacob
had
spoken
these
words
the
power
of
the
lord
came
upon
him
insomuch
that
he
fell
to
the
earth
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
was
nourished
for
the
space
of
many
days

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
unto
the
people
gather
together
on
the
morrow
for
i
shall
die
wherefore
i
desire
to
speak
unto
the
people
before
i
shall
die

and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
the
multitude
were
gathered
together
and
he
spake
plainly
unto
them
and
denied
the
things
which
he
had
taught
them
and
confessed
the
christ
and
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
and
the
ministering
of
angels

and
he
spake
plainly
unto
them
that
he
had
been
deceived
by
the
power
of
the
devil
and
he
spake
of
hell
and
of
eternity
and
of
eternal
punishment

and
he
said
i
fear
lest
i
have
committed
the
unpardonable
sin
for
i
have
lied
unto
god
for
i
denied
the
christ
and
said
that
i
believed
the
scriptures
and
they
truly
testify
of
him
and
because
i
have
thus
lied
unto
god
i
greatly
fear
lest
my
case
shall
be
awful
but
i
confess
unto
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
said
these
words
he
could
say
no
more
and
he
gave
up
the
ghost

and
when
the
multitude
had
witnessed
that
he
spake
these
things
as
he
was
about
to
give
up
the
ghost
they
were
astonished
exceedingly
insomuch
that
the
power
of
god
came
down
upon
them
and
they
were
overcome
that
they
fell
to
the
earth

now
this
thing
was
pleasing
unto
me
jacob
for
i
had
requested
it
of
my
father
who
was
in
heaven
for
he
had
heard
my
cry
and
answered
my
prayer

and
it
came
to
pass
that
peace
and
the
love
of
god
was
restored
again
among
the
people
and
they
searched
the
scriptures
and
hearkened
no
more
to
the
words
of
this
wicked
man

and
it
came
to
pass
that
many
means
were
devised
to
reclaim
and
restore
the
lamanites
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
but
it
all
was
vain
for
they
delighted
in
wars
and
bloodshed
and
they
had
an
eternal
hatred
against
us
their
brethren
and
they
sought
by
the
power
of
their
arms
to
destroy
us
continually

wherefore
the
people
of
nephi
did
fortify
against
them
with
their
arms
and
with
all
their
might
trusting
in
the
god
and
rock
of
their
salvation
wherefore
they
became
as
yet
conquerors
of
their
enemies

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
jacob
began
to
be
old
and
the
record
of
this
people
being
kept
on
the
other
plates
of
nephi
wherefore
i
conclude
this
record
declaring
that
i
have
written
according
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
by
saying
that
the
time
passed
away
with
us
and
also
our
lives
passed
away
like
as
it
were
unto
us
a
dream
we
being
a
lonesome
and
a
solemn
people
wanderers
cast
out
from
jerusalem
born
in
tribulation
in
a
wilderness
and
hated
of
our
brethren
which
caused
wars
and
contentions
wherefore
we
did
mourn
out
our
days

and
i
jacob
saw
that
i
must
soon
go
down
to
my
grave
wherefore
i
said
unto
my
son
enos
take
these
plates
and
i
told
him
the
things
which
my
brother
nephi
had
commanded
me
and
he
promised
obedience
unto
the
commands
and
i
make
an
end
of
my
writing
upon
these
plates
which
writing
has
been
small
and
to
the
reader
i
bid
farewell
hoping
that
many
of
my
brethren
may
read
my
words
brethren
adieu
the
book
of
enos

behold
it
came
to
pass
that
i
enos
knowing
my
father
that
he
was
a
just
manfor
he
taught
me
in
his
language
and
also
in
the
nurture
and
admonition
of
the
lordand
blessed
be
the
name
of
my
god
for
it

and
i
will
tell
you
of
the
wrestle
which
i
had
before
god
before
i
received
a
remission
of
my
sins

behold
i
went
to
hunt
beasts
in
the
forests
and
the
words
which
i
had
often
heard
my
father
speak
concerning
eternal
life
and
the
joy
of
the
saints
sunk
deep
into
my
heart

and
my
soul
hungered
and
i
kneeled
down
before
my
maker
and
i
cried
unto
him
in
mighty
prayer
and
supplication
for
mine
own
soul
and
all
the
day
long
did
i
cry
unto
him
yea
and
when
the
night
came
i
did
still
raise
my
voice
high
that
it
reached
the
heavens

and
there
came
a
voice
unto
me
saying
enos
thy
sins
are
forgiven
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
blessed

and
i
enos
knew
that
god
could
not
lie
wherefore
my
guilt
was
swept
away

and
i
said
lord
how
is
it
done

and
he
said
unto
me
because
of
thy
faith
in
christ
whom
thou
hast
never
before
heard
nor
seen
and
many
years
pass
away
before
he
shall
manifest
himself
in
the
flesh
wherefore
go
to
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
whole

now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
i
had
heard
these
words
i
began
to
feel
a
desire
for
the
welfare
of
my
brethren
the
nephites
wherefore
i
did
pour
out
my
whole
soul
unto
god
for
them

and
while
i
was
thus
struggling
in
the
spirit
behold
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
into
my
mind
again
saying
i
will
visit
thy
brethren
according
to
their
diligence
in
keeping
my
commandments
i
have
given
unto
them
this
land
and
it
is
a
holy
land
and
i
curse
it
not
save
it
be
for
the
cause
of
iniquity
wherefore
i
will
visit
thy
brethren
according
as
i
have
said
and
their
transgressions
will
i
bring
down
with
sorrow
upon
their
own
heads

and
after
i
enos
had
heard
these
words
my
faith
began
to
be
unshaken
in
the
lord
and
i
prayed
unto
him
with
many
long
strugglings
for
my
brethren
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
i
had
prayed
and
labored
with
all
diligence
the
lord
said
unto
me
i
will
grant
unto
thee
according
to
thy
desires
because
of
thy
faith

and
now
behold
this
was
the
desire
which
i
desired
of
himthat
if
it
should
so
be
that
my
people
the
nephites
should
fall
into
transgression
and
by
any
means
be
destroyed
and
the
lamanites
should
not
be
destroyed
that
the
lord
god
would
preserve
a
record
of
my
people
the
nephites
even
if
it
so
be
by
the
power
of
his
holy
arm
that
it
might
be
brought
forth
at
some
future
day
unto
the
lamanites
that
perhaps
they
might
be
brought
unto
salvation

for
at
the
present
our
strugglings
were
vain
in
restoring
them
to
the
true
faith
and
they
swore
in
their
wrath
that
if
it
were
possible
they
would
destroy
our
records
and
us
and
also
all
the
traditions
of
our
fathers

wherefore
i
knowing
that
the
lord
god
was
able
to
preserve
our
records
i
cried
unto
him
continually
for
he
had
said
unto
me
whatsoever
thing
ye
shall
ask
in
faith
believing
that
ye
shall
receive
in
the
name
of
christ
ye
shall
receive
it

and
i
had
faith
and
i
did
cry
unto
god
that
he
would
preserve
the
records
and
he
covenanted
with
me
that
he
would
bring
them
forth
unto
the
lamanites
in
his
own
due
time

and
i
enos
knew
it
would
be
according
to
the
covenant
which
he
had
made
wherefore
my
soul
did
rest

and
the
lord
said
unto
me
thy
fathers
have
also
required
of
me
this
thing
and
it
shall
be
done
unto
them
according
to
their
faith
for
their
faith
was
like
unto
thine

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
i
enos
went
about
among
the
people
of
nephi
prophesying
of
things
to
come
and
testifying
of
the
things
which
i
had
heard
and
seen

and
i
bear
record
that
the
people
of
nephi
did
seek
diligently
to
restore
the
lamanites
unto
the
true
faith
in
god
but
our
labors
were
vain
their
hatred
was
fixed
and
they
were
led
by
their
evil
nature
that
they
became
wild
and
ferocious
and
a
bloodthirsty
people
full
of
idolatry
and
filthiness
feeding
upon
beasts
of
prey
dwelling
in
tents
and
wandering
about
in
the
wilderness
with
a
short
skin
girdle
about
their
loins
and
their
heads
shaven
and
their
skill
was
in
the
bow
and
in
the
cimeter
and
the
ax
and
many
of
them
did
eat
nothing
save
it
was
raw
meat
and
they
were
continually
seeking
to
destroy
us

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
nephi
did
till
the
land
and
raise
all
manner
of
grain
and
of
fruit
and
flocks
of
herds
and
flocks
of
all
manner
of
cattle
of
every
kind
and
goats
and
wild
goats
and
also
many
horses

and
there
were
exceedingly
many
prophets
among
us
and
the
people
were
a
stiffnecked
people
hard
to
understand

and
there
was
nothing
save
it
was
exceeding
harshness
preaching
and
prophesying
of
wars
and
contentions
and
destructions
and
continually
reminding
them
of
death
and
the
duration
of
eternity
and
the
judgments
and
the
power
of
god
and
all
these
thingsstirring
them
up
continually
to
keep
them
in
the
fear
of
the
lord
i
say
there
was
nothing
short
of
these
things
and
exceedingly
great
plainness
of
speech
would
keep
them
from
going
down
speedily
to
destruction
and
after
this
manner
do
i
write
concerning
them

and
i
saw
wars
between
the
nephites
and
lamanites
in
the
course
of
my
days

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
began
to
be
old
and
an
hundred
and
seventy
and
nine
years
had
passed
away
from
the
time
that
our
father
lehi
left
jerusalem

and
i
saw
that
i
must
soon
go
down
to
my
grave
having
been
wrought
upon
by
the
power
of
god
that
i
must
preach
and
prophesy
unto
this
people
and
declare
the
word
according
to
the
truth
which
is
in
christ
and
i
have
declared
it
in
all
my
days
and
have
rejoiced
in
it
above
that
of
the
world

and
i
soon
go
to
the
place
of
my
rest
which
is
with
my
redeemer
for
i
know
that
in
him
i
shall
rest
and
i
rejoice
in
the
day
when
my
mortal
shall
put
on
immortality
and
shall
stand
before
him
then
shall
i
see
his
face
with
pleasure
and
he
will
say
unto
me
come
unto
me
ye
blessed
there
is
a
place
prepared
for
you
in
the
mansions
of
my
father
amen
the
book
of
jarom

now
behold
i
jarom
write
a
few
words
according
to
the
commandment
of
my
father
enos
that
our
genealogy
may
be
kept

and
as
these
plates
are
small
and
as
these
things
are
written
for
the
intent
of
the
benefit
of
our
brethren
the
lamanites
wherefore
it
must
needs
be
that
i
write
a
little
but
i
shall
not
write
the
things
of
my
prophesying
nor
of
my
revelations
for
what
could
i
write
more
than
my
fathers
have
written
for
have
not
they
revealed
the
plan
of
salvation
i
say
unto
you
yea
and
this
sufficeth
me

behold
it
is
expedient
that
much
should
be
done
among
this
people
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
the
deafness
of
their
ears
and
the
blindness
of
their
minds
and
the
stiffness
of
their
necks
nevertheless
god
is
exceedingly
merciful
unto
them
and
has
not
as
yet
swept
them
off
from
the
face
of
the
land

and
there
are
many
among
us
who
have
many
revelations
for
they
are
not
all
stiffnecked
and
as
many
as
are
not
stiffnecked
and
have
faith
have
communion
with
the
holy
spirit
which
maketh
manifest
unto
the
children
of
men
according
to
their
faith

and
now
behold
two
hundred
years
had
passed
away
and
the
people
of
nephi
had
waxed
strong
in
the
land
they
observed
to
keep
the
law
of
moses
and
the
sabbath
day
holy
unto
the
lord
and
they
profaned
not
neither
did
they
blaspheme
and
the
laws
of
the
land
were
exceedingly
strict

and
they
were
scattered
upon
much
of
the
face
of
the
land
and
the
lamanites
also
and
they
were
exceedingly
more
numerous
than
were
they
of
the
nephites
and
they
loved
murder
and
would
drink
the
blood
of
beasts

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
came
many
times
against
us
the
nephites
to
battle
but
our
kings
and
our
leaders
were
mighty
men
in
the
faith
of
the
lord
and
they
taught
the
people
the
ways
of
the
lord
wherefore
we
withstood
the
lamanites
and
swept
them
away
out
of
our
lands
and
began
to
fortify
our
cities
or
whatsoever
place
of
our
inheritance

and
we
multiplied
exceedingly
and
spread
upon
the
face
of
the
land
and
became
exceedingly
rich
in
gold
and
in
silver
and
in
precious
things
and
in
fine
workmanship
of
wood
in
buildings
and
in
machinery
and
also
in
iron
and
copper
and
brass
and
steel
making
all
manner
of
tools
of
every
kind
to
till
the
ground
and
weapons
of
waryea
the
sharp
pointed
arrow
and
the
quiver
and
the
dart
and
the
javelin
and
all
preparations
for
war

and
thus
being
prepared
to
meet
the
lamanites
they
did
not
prosper
against
us
but
the
word
of
the
lord
was
verified
which
he
spake
unto
our
fathers
saying
that
inasmuch
as
ye
will
keep
my
commandments
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
prophets
of
the
lord
did
threaten
the
people
of
nephi
according
to
the
word
of
god
that
if
they
did
not
keep
the
commandments
but
should
fall
into
transgression
they
should
be
destroyed
from
off
the
face
of
the
land

wherefore
the
prophets
and
the
priests
and
the
teachers
did
labor
diligently
exhorting
with
all
longsuffering
the
people
to
diligence
teaching
the
law
of
moses
and
the
intent
for
which
it
was
given
persuading
them
to
look
forward
unto
the
messiah
and
believe
in
him
to
come
as
though
he
already
was
and
after
this
manner
did
they
teach
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
by
so
doing
they
kept
them
from
being
destroyed
upon
the
face
of
the
land
for
they
did
prick
their
hearts
with
the
word
continually
stirring
them
up
unto
repentance

and
it
came
to
pass
that
two
hundred
and
thirty
and
eight
years
had
passed
awayafter
the
manner
of
wars
and
contentions
and
dissensions
for
the
space
of
much
of
the
time

and
i
jarom
do
not
write
more
for
the
plates
are
small
but
behold
my
brethren
ye
can
go
to
the
other
plates
of
nephi
for
behold
upon
them
the
records
of
our
wars
are
engraven
according
to
the
writings
of
the
kings
or
those
which
they
caused
to
be
written

and
i
deliver
these
plates
into
the
hands
of
my
son
omni
that
they
may
be
kept
according
to
the
commandments
of
my
fathers
the
book
of
omni

behold
it
came
to
pass
that
i
omni
being
commanded
by
my
father
jarom
that
i
should
write
somewhat
upon
these
plates
to
preserve
our
genealogy

wherefore
in
my
days
i
would
that
ye
should
know
that
i
fought
much
with
the
sword
to
preserve
my
people
the
nephites
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
their
enemies
the
lamanites
but
behold
i
of
myself
am
a
wicked
man
and
i
have
not
kept
the
statutes
and
the
commandments
of
the
lord
as
i
ought
to
have
done

and
it
came
to
pass
that
two
hundred
and
seventy
and
six
years
had
passed
away
and
we
had
many
seasons
of
peace
and
we
had
many
seasons
of
serious
war
and
bloodshed
yea
and
in
fine
two
hundred
and
eighty
and
two
years
had
passed
away
and
i
had
kept
these
plates
according
to
the
commandments
of
my
fathers
and
i
conferred
them
upon
my
son
amaron
and
i
make
an
end

and
now
i
amaron
write
the
things
whatsoever
i
write
which
are
few
in
the
book
of
my
father

behold
it
came
to
pass
that
three
hundred
and
twenty
years
had
passed
away
and
the
more
wicked
part
of
the
nephites
were
destroyed

for
the
lord
would
not
suffer
after
he
had
led
them
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
kept
and
preserved
them
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
their
enemies
yea
he
would
not
suffer
that
the
words
should
not
be
verified
which
he
spake
unto
our
fathers
saying
that
inasmuch
as
ye
will
not
keep
my
commandments
ye
shall
not
prosper
in
the
land

wherefore
the
lord
did
visit
them
in
great
judgment
nevertheless
he
did
spare
the
righteous
that
they
should
not
perish
but
did
deliver
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
did
deliver
the
plates
unto
my
brother
chemish

now
i
chemish
write
what
few
things
i
write
in
the
same
book
with
my
brother
for
behold
i
saw
the
last
which
he
wrote
that
he
wrote
it
with
his
own
hand
and
he
wrote
it
in
the
day
that
he
delivered
them
unto
me
and
after
this
manner
we
keep
the
records
for
it
is
according
to
the
commandments
of
our
fathers
and
i
make
an
end

behold
i
abinadom
am
the
son
of
chemish
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
i
saw
much
war
and
contention
between
my
people
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites
and
i
with
my
own
sword
have
taken
the
lives
of
many
of
the
lamanites
in
the
defence
of
my
brethren

and
behold
the
record
of
this
people
is
engraven
upon
plates
which
is
had
by
the
kings
according
to
the
generations
and
i
know
of
no
revelation
save
that
which
has
been
written
neither
prophecy
wherefore
that
which
is
sufficient
is
written
and
i
make
an
end

behold
i
am
amaleki
the
son
of
abinadom
behold
i
will
speak
unto
you
somewhat
concerning
mosiah
who
was
made
king
over
the
land
of
zarahemla
for
behold
he
being
warned
of
the
lord
that
he
should
flee
out
of
the
land
of
nephi
and
as
many
as
would
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
lord
should
also
depart
out
of
the
land
with
him
into
the
wilderness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
according
as
the
lord
had
commanded
him
and
they
departed
out
of
the
land
into
the
wilderness
as
many
as
would
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
lord
and
they
were
led
by
many
preachings
and
prophesyings
and
they
were
admonished
continually
by
the
word
of
god
and
they
were
led
by
the
power
of
his
arm
through
the
wilderness
until
they
came
down
into
the
land
which
is
called
the
land
of
zarahemla

and
they
discovered
a
people
who
were
called
the
people
of
zarahemla
now
there
was
great
rejoicing
among
the
people
of
zarahemla
and
also
zarahemla
did
rejoice
exceedingly
because
the
lord
had
sent
the
people
of
mosiah
with
the
plates
of
brass
which
contained
the
record
of
the
jews

behold
it
came
to
pass
that
mosiah
discovered
that
the
people
of
zarahemla
came
out
from
jerusalem
at
the
time
that
zedekiah
king
of
judah
was
carried
away
captive
into
babylon

and
they
journeyed
in
the
wilderness
and
were
brought
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
across
the
great
waters
into
the
land
where
mosiah
discovered
them
and
they
had
dwelt
there
from
that
time
forth

and
at
the
time
that
mosiah
discovered
them
they
had
become
exceedingly
numerous
nevertheless
they
had
had
many
wars
and
serious
contentions
and
had
fallen
by
the
sword
from
time
to
time
and
their
language
had
become
corrupted
and
they
had
brought
no
records
with
them
and
they
denied
the
being
of
their
creator
and
mosiah
nor
the
people
of
mosiah
could
understand
them

but
it
came
to
pass
that
mosiah
caused
that
they
should
be
taught
in
his
language
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
they
were
taught
in
the
language
of
mosiah
zarahemla
gave
a
genealogy
of
his
fathers
according
to
his
memory
and
they
are
written
but
not
in
these
plates

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
zarahemla
and
of
mosiah
did
unite
together
and
mosiah
was
appointed
to
be
their
king

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
mosiah
there
was
a
large
stone
brought
unto
him
with
engravings
on
it
and
he
did
interpret
the
engravings
by
the
gift
and
power
of
god

and
they
gave
an
account
of
one
coriantumr
and
the
slain
of
his
people
and
coriantumr
was
discovered
by
the
people
of
zarahemla
and
he
dwelt
with
them
for
the
space
of
nine
moons

it
also
spake
a
few
words
concerning
his
fathers
and
his
first
parents
came
out
from
the
tower
at
the
time
the
lord
confounded
the
language
of
the
people
and
the
severity
of
the
lord
fell
upon
them
according
to
his
judgments
which
are
just
and
their
bones
lay
scattered
in
the
land
northward

behold
i
amaleki
was
born
in
the
days
of
mosiah
and
i
have
lived
to
see
his
death
and
benjamin
his
son
reigneth
in
his
stead

and
behold
i
have
seen
in
the
days
of
king
benjamin
a
serious
war
and
much
bloodshed
between
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites
but
behold
the
nephites
did
obtain
much
advantage
over
them
yea
insomuch
that
king
benjamin
did
drive
them
out
of
the
land
of
zarahemla

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
began
to
be
old
and
having
no
seed
and
knowing
king
benjamin
to
be
a
just
man
before
the
lord
wherefore
i
shall
deliver
up
these
plates
unto
him
exhorting
all
men
to
come
unto
god
the
holy
one
of
israel
and
believe
in
prophesying
and
in
revelations
and
in
the
ministering
of
angels
and
in
the
gift
of
speaking
with
tongues
and
in
the
gift
of
interpreting
languages
and
in
all
things
which
are
good
for
there
is
nothing
which
is
good
save
it
comes
from
the
lord
and
that
which
is
evil
cometh
from
the
devil

and
now
my
beloved
brethren
i
would
that
ye
should
come
unto
christ
who
is
the
holy
one
of
israel
and
partake
of
his
salvation
and
the
power
of
his
redemption
yea
come
unto
him
and
offer
your
whole
souls
as
an
offering
unto
him
and
continue
in
fasting
and
praying
and
endure
to
the
end
and
as
the
lord
liveth
ye
will
be
saved

and
now
i
would
speak
somewhat
concerning
a
certain
number
who
went
up
into
the
wilderness
to
return
to
the
land
of
nephi
for
there
was
a
large
number
who
were
desirous
to
possess
the
land
of
their
inheritance

wherefore
they
went
up
into
the
wilderness
and
their
leader
being
a
strong
and
mighty
man
and
a
stiffnecked
man
wherefore
he
caused
a
contention
among
them
and
they
were
all
slain
save
fifty
in
the
wilderness
and
they
returned
again
to
the
land
of
zarahemla

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
also
took
others
to
a
considerable
number
and
took
their
journey
again
into
the
wilderness

and
i
amaleki
had
a
brother
who
also
went
with
them
and
i
have
not
since
known
concerning
them
and
i
am
about
to
lie
down
in
my
grave
and
these
plates
are
full
and
i
make
an
end
of
my
speaking
the
words
of
mormon

and
now
i
mormon
being
about
to
deliver
up
the
record
which
i
have
been
making
into
the
hands
of
my
son
moroni
behold
i
have
witnessed
almost
all
the
destruction
of
my
people
the
nephites

and
it
is
many
hundred
years
after
the
coming
of
christ
that
i
deliver
these
records
into
the
hands
of
my
son
and
it
supposeth
me
that
he
will
witness
the
entire
destruction
of
my
people
but
may
god
grant
that
he
may
survive
them
that
he
may
write
somewhat
concerning
them
and
somewhat
concerning
christ
that
perhaps
some
day
it
may
profit
them

and
now
i
speak
somewhat
concerning
that
which
i
have
written
for
after
i
had
made
an
abridgment
from
the
plates
of
nephi
down
to
the
reign
of
this
king
benjamin
of
whom
amaleki
spake
i
searched
among
the
records
which
had
been
delivered
into
my
hands
and
i
found
these
plates
which
contained
this
small
account
of
the
prophets
from
jacob
down
to
the
reign
of
this
king
benjamin
and
also
many
of
the
words
of
nephi

and
the
things
which
are
upon
these
plates
pleasing
me
because
of
the
prophecies
of
the
coming
of
christ
and
my
fathers
knowing
that
many
of
them
have
been
fulfilled
yea
and
i
also
know
that
as
many
things
as
have
been
prophesied
concerning
us
down
to
this
day
have
been
fulfilled
and
as
many
as
go
beyond
this
day
must
surely
come
to
pass

wherefore
i
chose
these
things
to
finish
my
record
upon
them
which
remainder
of
my
record
i
shall
take
from
the
plates
of
nephi
and
i
cannot
write
the
hundredth
part
of
the
things
of
my
people

but
behold
i
shall
take
these
plates
which
contain
these
prophesyings
and
revelations
and
put
them
with
the
remainder
of
my
record
for
they
are
choice
unto
me
and
i
know
they
will
be
choice
unto
my
brethren

and
i
do
this
for
a
wise
purpose
for
thus
it
whispereth
me
according
to
the
workings
of
the
spirit
of
the
lord
which
is
in
me
and
now
i
do
not
know
all
things
but
the
lord
knoweth
all
things
which
are
to
come
wherefore
he
worketh
in
me
to
do
according
to
his
will

and
my
prayer
to
god
is
concerning
my
brethren
that
they
may
once
again
come
to
the
knowledge
of
god
yea
the
redemption
of
christ
that
they
may
once
again
be
a
delightsome
people

and
now
i
mormon
proceed
to
finish
out
my
record
which
i
take
from
the
plates
of
nephi
and
i
make
it
according
to
the
knowledge
and
the
understanding
which
god
has
given
me

wherefore
it
came
to
pass
that
after
amaleki
had
delivered
up
these
plates
into
the
hands
of
king
benjamin
he
took
them
and
put
them
with
the
other
plates
which
contained
records
which
had
been
handed
down
by
the
kings
from
generation
to
generation
until
the
days
of
king
benjamin

and
they
were
handed
down
from
king
benjamin
from
generation
to
generation
until
they
have
fallen
into
my
hands
and
i
mormon
pray
to
god
that
they
may
be
preserved
from
this
time
henceforth
and
i
know
that
they
will
be
preserved
for
there
are
great
things
written
upon
them
out
of
which
my
people
and
their
brethren
shall
be
judged
at
the
great
and
last
day
according
to
the
word
of
god
which
is
written

and
now
concerning
this
king
benjaminhe
had
somewhat
of
contentions
among
his
own
people

and
it
came
to
pass
also
that
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
came
down
out
of
the
land
of
nephi
to
battle
against
his
people
but
behold
king
benjamin
gathered
together
his
armies
and
he
did
stand
against
them
and
he
did
fight
with
the
strength
of
his
own
arm
with
the
sword
of
laban

and
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
they
did
contend
against
their
enemies
until
they
had
slain
many
thousands
of
the
lamanites
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
contend
against
the
lamanites
until
they
had
driven
them
out
of
all
the
lands
of
their
inheritance

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
there
had
been
false
christs
and
their
mouths
had
been
shut
and
they
punished
according
to
their
crimes

and
after
there
had
been
false
prophets
and
false
preachers
and
teachers
among
the
people
and
all
these
having
been
punished
according
to
their
crimes
and
after
there
having
been
much
contention
and
many
dissensions
away
unto
the
lamanites
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
king
benjamin
with
the
assistance
of
the
holy
prophets
who
were
among
his
people

for
behold
king
benjamin
was
a
holy
man
and
he
did
reign
over
his
people
in
righteousness
and
there
were
many
holy
men
in
the
land
and
they
did
speak
the
word
of
god
with
power
and
with
authority
and
they
did
use
much
sharpness
because
of
the
stiffneckedness
of
the
people

wherefore
with
the
help
of
these
king
benjamin
by
laboring
with
all
the
might
of
his
body
and
the
faculty
of
his
whole
soul
and
also
the
prophets
did
once
more
establish
peace
in
the
land
the
book
of
mosiah
mosiah
chapter


and
now
there
was
no
more
contention
in
all
the
land
of
zarahemla
among
all
the
people
who
belonged
to
king
benjamin
so
that
king
benjamin
had
continual
peace
all
the
remainder
of
his
days

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
had
three
sons
and
he
called
their
names
mosiah
and
helorum
and
helaman
and
he
caused
that
they
should
be
taught
in
all
the
language
of
his
fathers
that
thereby
they
might
become
men
of
understanding
and
that
they
might
know
concerning
the
prophecies
which
had
been
spoken
by
the
mouths
of
their
fathers
which
were
delivered
them
by
the
hand
of
the
lord

and
he
also
taught
them
concerning
the
records
which
were
engraven
on
the
plates
of
brass
saying
my
sons
i
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
were
it
not
for
these
plates
which
contain
these
records
and
these
commandments
we
must
have
suffered
in
ignorance
even
at
this
present
time
not
knowing
the
mysteries
of
god

for
it
were
not
possible
that
our
father
lehi
could
have
remembered
all
these
things
to
have
taught
them
to
his
children
except
it
were
for
the
help
of
these
plates
for
he
having
been
taught
in
the
language
of
the
egyptians
therefore
he
could
read
these
engravings
and
teach
them
to
his
children
that
thereby
they
could
teach
them
to
their
children
and
so
fulfilling
the
commandments
of
god
even
down
to
this
present
time

i
say
unto
you
my
sons
were
it
not
for
these
things
which
have
been
kept
and
preserved
by
the
hand
of
god
that
we
might
read
and
understand
of
his
mysteries
and
have
his
commandments
always
before
our
eyes
that
even
our
fathers
would
have
dwindled
in
unbelief
and
we
should
have
been
like
unto
our
brethren
the
lamanites
who
know
nothing
concerning
these
things
or
even
do
not
believe
them
when
they
are
taught
them
because
of
the
traditions
of
their
fathers
which
are
not
correct

o
my
sons
i
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
these
sayings
are
true
and
also
that
these
records
are
true
and
behold
also
the
plates
of
nephi
which
contain
the
records
and
the
sayings
of
our
fathers
from
the
time
they
left
jerusalem
until
now
and
they
are
true
and
we
can
know
of
their
surety
because
we
have
them
before
our
eyes

and
now
my
sons
i
would
that
ye
should
remember
to
search
them
diligently
that
ye
may
profit
thereby
and
i
would
that
ye
should
keep
the
commandments
of
god
that
ye
may
prosper
in
the
land
according
to
the
promises
which
the
lord
made
unto
our
fathers

and
many
more
things
did
king
benjamin
teach
his
sons
which
are
not
written
in
this
book

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
king
benjamin
had
made
an
end
of
teaching
his
sons
that
he
waxed
old
and
he
saw
that
he
must
very
soon
go
the
way
of
all
the
earth
therefore
he
thought
it
expedient
that
he
should
confer
the
kingdom
upon
one
of
his
sons

therefore
he
had
mosiah
brought
before
him
and
these
are
the
words
which
he
spake
unto
him
saying
my
son
i
would
that
ye
should
make
a
proclamation
throughout
all
this
land
among
all
this
people
or
the
people
of
zarahemla
and
the
people
of
mosiah
who
dwell
in
the
land
that
thereby
they
may
be
gathered
together
for
on
the
morrow
i
shall
proclaim
unto
this
my
people
out
of
mine
own
mouth
that
thou
art
a
king
and
a
ruler
over
this
people
whom
the
lord
our
god
hath
given
us

and
moreover
i
shall
give
this
people
a
name
that
thereby
they
may
be
distinguished
above
all
the
people
which
the
lord
god
hath
brought
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
this
i
do
because
they
have
been
a
diligent
people
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
the
lord

and
i
give
unto
them
a
name
that
never
shall
be
blotted
out
except
it
be
through
transgression

yea
and
moreover
i
say
unto
you
that
if
this
highly
favored
people
of
the
lord
should
fall
into
transgression
and
become
a
wicked
and
an
adulterous
people
that
the
lord
will
deliver
them
up
that
thereby
they
become
weak
like
unto
their
brethren
and
he
will
no
more
preserve
them
by
his
matchless
and
marvelous
power
as
he
has
hitherto
preserved
our
fathers

for
i
say
unto
you
that
if
he
had
not
extended
his
arm
in
the
preservation
of
our
fathers
they
must
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
lamanites
and
become
victims
to
their
hatred

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
king
benjamin
had
made
an
end
of
these
sayings
to
his
son
that
he
gave
him
charge
concerning
all
the
affairs
of
the
kingdom

and
moreover
he
also
gave
him
charge
concerning
the
records
which
were
engraven
on
the
plates
of
brass
and
also
the
plates
of
nephi
and
also
the
sword
of
laban
and
the
ball
or
director
which
led
our
fathers
through
the
wilderness
which
was
prepared
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
that
thereby
they
might
be
led
every
one
according
to
the
heed
and
diligence
which
they
gave
unto
him

therefore
as
they
were
unfaithful
they
did
not
prosper
nor
progress
in
their
journey
but
were
driven
back
and
incurred
the
displeasure
of
god
upon
them
and
therefore
they
were
smitten
with
famine
and
sore
afflictions
to
stir
them
up
in
remembrance
of
their
duty

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
mosiah
went
and
did
as
his
father
had
commanded
him
and
proclaimed
unto
all
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
that
thereby
they
might
gather
themselves
together
to
go
up
to
the
temple
to
hear
the
words
which
his
father
should
speak
unto
them
mosiah
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
mosiah
had
done
as
his
father
had
commanded
him
and
had
made
a
proclamation
throughout
all
the
land
that
the
people
gathered
themselves
together
throughout
all
the
land
that
they
might
go
up
to
the
temple
to
hear
the
words
which
king
benjamin
should
speak
unto
them

and
there
were
a
great
number
even
so
many
that
they
did
not
number
them
for
they
had
multiplied
exceedingly
and
waxed
great
in
the
land

and
they
also
took
of
the
firstlings
of
their
flocks
that
they
might
offer
sacrifice
and
burnt
offerings
according
to
the
law
of
moses

and
also
that
they
might
give
thanks
to
the
lord
their
god
who
had
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
who
had
delivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
and
had
appointed
just
men
to
be
their
teachers
and
also
a
just
man
to
be
their
king
who
had
established
peace
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
who
had
taught
them
to
keep
the
commandments
of
god
that
they
might
rejoice
and
be
filled
with
love
towards
god
and
all
men

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
came
up
to
the
temple
they
pitched
their
tents
round
about
every
man
according
to
his
family
consisting
of
his
wife
and
his
sons
and
his
daughters
and
their
sons
and
their
daughters
from
the
eldest
down
to
the
youngest
every
family
being
separate
one
from
another

and
they
pitched
their
tents
round
about
the
temple
every
man
having
his
tent
with
the
door
thereof
towards
the
temple
that
thereby
they
might
remain
in
their
tents
and
hear
the
words
which
king
benjamin
should
speak
unto
them

for
the
multitude
being
so
great
that
king
benjamin
could
not
teach
them
all
within
the
walls
of
the
temple
therefore
he
caused
a
tower
to
be
erected
that
thereby
his
people
might
hear
the
words
which
he
should
speak
unto
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
began
to
speak
to
his
people
from
the
tower
and
they
could
not
all
hear
his
words
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
multitude
therefore
he
caused
that
the
words
which
he
spake
should
be
written
and
sent
forth
among
those
that
were
not
under
the
sound
of
his
voice
that
they
might
also
receive
his
words

and
these
are
the
words
which
he
spake
and
caused
to
be
written
saying
my
brethren
all
ye
that
have
assembled
yourselves
together
you
that
can
hear
my
words
which
i
shall
speak
unto
you
this
day
for
i
have
not
commanded
you
to
come
up
hither
to
trifle
with
the
words
which
i
shall
speak
but
that
you
should
hearken
unto
me
and
open
your
ears
that
ye
may
hear
and
your
hearts
that
ye
may
understand
and
your
minds
that
the
mysteries
of
god
may
be
unfolded
to
your
view

i
have
not
commanded
you
to
come
up
hither
that
ye
should
fear
me
or
that
ye
should
think
that
i
of
myself
am
more
than
a
mortal
man

but
i
am
like
as
yourselves
subject
to
all
manner
of
infirmities
in
body
and
mind
yet
i
have
been
chosen
by
this
people
and
consecrated
by
my
father
and
was
suffered
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
that
i
should
be
a
ruler
and
a
king
over
this
people
and
have
been
kept
and
preserved
by
his
matchless
power
to
serve
you
with
all
the
might
mind
and
strength
which
the
lord
hath
granted
unto
me

i
say
unto
you
that
as
i
have
been
suffered
to
spend
my
days
in
your
service
even
up
to
this
time
and
have
not
sought
gold
nor
silver
nor
any
manner
of
riches
of
you

neither
have
i
suffered
that
ye
should
be
confined
in
dungeons
nor
that
ye
should
make
slaves
one
of
another
nor
that
ye
should
murder
or
plunder
or
steal
or
commit
adultery
nor
even
have
i
suffered
that
ye
should
commit
any
manner
of
wickedness
and
have
taught
you
that
ye
should
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
in
all
things
which
he
hath
commanded
you

and
even
i
myself
have
labored
with
mine
own
hands
that
i
might
serve
you
and
that
ye
should
not
be
laden
with
taxes
and
that
there
should
nothing
come
upon
you
which
was
grievous
to
be
borneand
of
all
these
things
which
i
have
spoken
ye
yourselves
are
witnesses
this
day

yet
my
brethren
i
have
not
done
these
things
that
i
might
boast
neither
do
i
tell
these
things
that
thereby
i
might
accuse
you
but
i
tell
you
these
things
that
ye
may
know
that
i
can
answer
a
clear
conscience
before
god
this
day

behold
i
say
unto
you
that
because
i
said
unto
you
that
i
had
spent
my
days
in
your
service
i
do
not
desire
to
boast
for
i
have
only
been
in
the
service
of
god

and
behold
i
tell
you
these
things
that
ye
may
learn
wisdom
that
ye
may
learn
that
when
ye
are
in
the
service
of
your
fellow
beings
ye
are
only
in
the
service
of
your
god

behold
ye
have
called
me
your
king
and
if
i
whom
ye
call
your
king
do
labor
to
serve
you
then
ought
not
ye
to
labor
to
serve
one
another

and
behold
also
if
i
whom
ye
call
your
king
who
has
spent
his
days
in
your
service
and
yet
has
been
in
the
service
of
god
do
merit
any
thanks
from
you
o
how
you
ought
to
thank
your
heavenly
king

i
say
unto
you
my
brethren
that
if
you
should
render
all
the
thanks
and
praise
which
your
whole
soul
has
power
to
possess
to
that
god
who
has
created
you
and
has
kept
and
preserved
you
and
has
caused
that
ye
should
rejoice
and
has
granted
that
ye
should
live
in
peace
one
with
another

i
say
unto
you
that
if
ye
should
serve
him
who
has
created
you
from
the
beginning
and
is
preserving
you
from
day
to
day
by
lending
you
breath
that
ye
may
live
and
move
and
do
according
to
your
own
will
and
even
supporting
you
from
one
moment
to
anotheri
say
if
ye
should
serve
him
with
all
your
whole
souls
yet
ye
would
be
unprofitable
servants

and
behold
all
that
he
requires
of
you
is
to
keep
his
commandments
and
he
has
promised
you
that
if
ye
would
keep
his
commandments
ye
should
prosper
in
the
land
and
he
never
doth
vary
from
that
which
he
hath
said
therefore
if
ye
do
keep
his
commandments
he
doth
bless
you
and
prosper
you

and
now
in
the
first
place
he
hath
created
you
and
granted
unto
you
your
lives
for
which
ye
are
indebted
unto
him

and
secondly
he
doth
require
that
ye
should
do
as
he
hath
commanded
you
for
which
if
ye
do
he
doth
immediately
bless
you
and
therefore
he
hath
paid
you
and
ye
are
still
indebted
unto
him
and
are
and
will
be
forever
and
ever
therefore
of
what
have
ye
to
boast

and
now
i
ask
can
ye
say
aught
of
yourselves
i
answer
you
nay
ye
cannot
say
that
ye
are
even
as
much
as
the
dust
of
the
earth
yet
ye
were
created
of
the
dust
of
the
earth
but
behold
it
belongeth
to
him
who
created
you

and
i
even
i
whom
ye
call
your
king
am
no
better
than
ye
yourselves
are
for
i
am
also
of
the
dust
and
ye
behold
that
i
am
old
and
am
about
to
yield
up
this
mortal
frame
to
its
mother
earth

therefore
as
i
said
unto
you
that
i
had
served
you
walking
with
a
clear
conscience
before
god
even
so
i
at
this
time
have
caused
that
ye
should
assemble
yourselves
together
that
i
might
be
found
blameless
and
that
your
blood
should
not
come
upon
me
when
i
shall
stand
to
be
judged
of
god
of
the
things
whereof
he
hath
commanded
me
concerning
you

i
say
unto
you
that
i
have
caused
that
ye
should
assemble
yourselves
together
that
i
might
rid
my
garments
of
your
blood
at
this
period
of
time
when
i
am
about
to
go
down
to
my
grave
that
i
might
go
down
in
peace
and
my
immortal
spirit
may
join
the
choirs
above
in
singing
the
praises
of
a
just
god

and
moreover
i
say
unto
you
that
i
have
caused
that
ye
should
assemble
yourselves
together
that
i
might
declare
unto
you
that
i
can
no
longer
be
your
teacher
nor
your
king

for
even
at
this
time
my
whole
frame
doth
tremble
exceedingly
while
attempting
to
speak
unto
you
but
the
lord
god
doth
support
me
and
hath
suffered
me
that
i
should
speak
unto
you
and
hath
commanded
me
that
i
should
declare
unto
you
this
day
that
my
son
mosiah
is
a
king
and
a
ruler
over
you

and
now
my
brethren
i
would
that
ye
should
do
as
ye
have
hitherto
done
as
ye
have
kept
my
commandments
and
also
the
commandments
of
my
father
and
have
prospered
and
have
been
kept
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
your
enemies
even
so
if
ye
shall
keep
the
commandments
of
my
son
or
the
commandments
of
god
which
shall
be
delivered
unto
you
by
him
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
land
and
your
enemies
shall
have
no
power
over
you

but
o
my
people
beware
lest
there
shall
arise
contentions
among
you
and
ye
list
to
obey
the
evil
spirit
which
was
spoken
of
by
my
father
mosiah

for
behold
there
is
a
wo
pronounced
upon
him
who
listeth
to
obey
that
spirit
for
if
he
listeth
to
obey
him
and
remaineth
and
dieth
in
his
sins
the
same
drinketh
damnation
to
his
own
soul
for
he
receiveth
for
his
wages
an
everlasting
punishment
having
transgressed
the
law
of
god
contrary
to
his
own
knowledge

i
say
unto
you
that
there
are
not
any
among
you
except
it
be
your
little
children
that
have
not
been
taught
concerning
these
things
but
what
knoweth
that
ye
are
eternally
indebted
to
your
heavenly
father
to
render
to
him
all
that
you
have
and
are
and
also
have
been
taught
concerning
the
records
which
contain
the
prophecies
which
have
been
spoken
by
the
holy
prophets
even
down
to
the
time
our
father
lehi
left
jerusalem

and
also
all
that
has
been
spoken
by
our
fathers
until
now
and
behold
also
they
spake
that
which
was
commanded
them
of
the
lord
therefore
they
are
just
and
true

and
now
i
say
unto
you
my
brethren
that
after
ye
have
known
and
have
been
taught
all
these
things
if
ye
should
transgress
and
go
contrary
to
that
which
has
been
spoken
that
ye
do
withdraw
yourselves
from
the
spirit
of
the
lord
that
it
may
have
no
place
in
you
to
guide
you
in
wisdoms
paths
that
ye
may
be
blessed
prospered
and
preserved

i
say
unto
you
that
the
man
that
doeth
this
the
same
cometh
out
in
open
rebellion
against
god
therefore
he
listeth
to
obey
the
evil
spirit
and
becometh
an
enemy
to
all
righteousness
therefore
the
lord
has
no
place
in
him
for
he
dwelleth
not
in
unholy
temples

therefore
if
that
man
repenteth
not
and
remaineth
and
dieth
an
enemy
to
god
the
demands
of
divine
justice
do
awaken
his
immortal
soul
to
a
lively
sense
of
his
own
guilt
which
doth
cause
him
to
shrink
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
doth
fill
his
breast
with
guilt
and
pain
and
anguish
which
is
like
an
unquenchable
fire
whose
flame
ascendeth
up
forever
and
ever

and
now
i
say
unto
you
that
mercy
hath
no
claim
on
that
man
therefore
his
final
doom
is
to
endure
a
neverending
torment

o
all
ye
old
men
and
also
ye
young
men
and
you
little
children
who
can
understand
my
words
for
i
have
spoken
plainly
unto
you
that
ye
might
understand
i
pray
that
ye
should
awake
to
a
remembrance
of
the
awful
situation
of
those
that
have
fallen
into
transgression

and
moreover
i
would
desire
that
ye
should
consider
on
the
blessed
and
happy
state
of
those
that
keep
the
commandments
of
god
for
behold
they
are
blessed
in
all
things
both
temporal
and
spiritual
and
if
they
hold
out
faithful
to
the
end
they
are
received
into
heaven
that
thereby
they
may
dwell
with
god
in
a
state
of
neverending
happiness
o
remember
remember
that
these
things
are
true
for
the
lord
god
hath
spoken
it
mosiah
chapter


and
again
my
brethren
i
would
call
your
attention
for
i
have
somewhat
more
to
speak
unto
you
for
behold
i
have
things
to
tell
you
concerning
that
which
is
to
come

and
the
things
which
i
shall
tell
you
are
made
known
unto
me
by
an
angel
from
god
and
he
said
unto
me
awake
and
i
awoke
and
behold
he
stood
before
me

and
he
said
unto
me
awake
and
hear
the
words
which
i
shall
tell
thee
for
behold
i
am
come
to
declare
unto
you
the
glad
tidings
of
great
joy

for
the
lord
hath
heard
thy
prayers
and
hath
judged
of
thy
righteousness
and
hath
sent
me
to
declare
unto
thee
that
thou
mayest
rejoice
and
that
thou
mayest
declare
unto
thy
people
that
they
may
also
be
filled
with
joy

for
behold
the
time
cometh
and
is
not
far
distant
that
with
power
the
lord
omnipotent
who
reigneth
who
was
and
is
from
all
eternity
to
all
eternity
shall
come
down
from
heaven
among
the
children
of
men
and
shall
dwell
in
a
tabernacle
of
clay
and
shall
go
forth
amongst
men
working
mighty
miracles
such
as
healing
the
sick
raising
the
dead
causing
the
lame
to
walk
the
blind
to
receive
their
sight
and
the
deaf
to
hear
and
curing
all
manner
of
diseases

and
he
shall
cast
out
devils
or
the
evil
spirits
which
dwell
in
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men

and
lo
he
shall
suffer
temptations
and
pain
of
body
hunger
thirst
and
fatigue
even
more
than
man
can
suffer
except
it
be
unto
death
for
behold
blood
cometh
from
every
pore
so
great
shall
be
his
anguish
for
the
wickedness
and
the
abominations
of
his
people

and
he
shall
be
called
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
the
father
of
heaven
and
earth
the
creator
of
all
things
from
the
beginning
and
his
mother
shall
be
called
mary

and
lo
he
cometh
unto
his
own
that
salvation
might
come
unto
the
children
of
men
even
through
faith
on
his
name
and
even
after
all
this
they
shall
consider
him
a
man
and
say
that
he
hath
a
devil
and
shall
scourge
him
and
shall
crucify
him

and
he
shall
rise
the
third
day
from
the
dead
and
behold
he
standeth
to
judge
the
world
and
behold
all
these
things
are
done
that
a
righteous
judgment
might
come
upon
the
children
of
men

for
behold
and
also
his
blood
atoneth
for
the
sins
of
those
who
have
fallen
by
the
transgression
of
adam
who
have
died
not
knowing
the
will
of
god
concerning
them
or
who
have
ignorantly
sinned

but
wo
wo
unto
him
who
knoweth
that
he
rebelleth
against
god
for
salvation
cometh
to
none
such
except
it
be
through
repentance
and
faith
on
the
lord
jesus
christ

and
the
lord
god
hath
sent
his
holy
prophets
among
all
the
children
of
men
to
declare
these
things
to
every
kindred
nation
and
tongue
that
thereby
whosoever
should
believe
that
christ
should
come
the
same
might
receive
remission
of
their
sins
and
rejoice
with
exceedingly
great
joy
even
as
though
he
had
already
come
among
them

yet
the
lord
god
saw
that
his
people
were
a
stiffnecked
people
and
he
appointed
unto
them
a
law
even
the
law
of
moses

and
many
signs
and
wonders
and
types
and
shadows
showed
he
unto
them
concerning
his
coming
and
also
holy
prophets
spake
unto
them
concerning
his
coming
and
yet
they
hardened
their
hearts
and
understood
not
that
the
law
of
moses
availeth
nothing
except
it
were
through
the
atonement
of
his
blood

and
even
if
it
were
possible
that
little
children
could
sin
they
could
not
be
saved
but
i
say
unto
you
they
are
blessed
for
behold
as
in
adam
or
by
nature
they
fall
even
so
the
blood
of
christ
atoneth
for
their
sins

and
moreover
i
say
unto
you
that
there
shall
be
no
other
name
given
nor
any
other
way
nor
means
whereby
salvation
can
come
unto
the
children
of
men
only
in
and
through
the
name
of
christ
the
lord
omnipotent

for
behold
he
judgeth
and
his
judgment
is
just
and
the
infant
perisheth
not
that
dieth
in
his
infancy
but
men
drink
damnation
to
their
own
souls
except
they
humble
themselves
and
become
as
little
children
and
believe
that
salvation
was
and
is
and
is
to
come
in
and
through
the
atoning
blood
of
christ
the
lord
omnipotent

for
the
natural
man
is
an
enemy
to
god
and
has
been
from
the
fall
of
adam
and
will
be
forever
and
ever
unless
he
yields
to
the
enticings
of
the
holy
spirit
and
putteth
off
the
natural
man
and
becometh
a
saint
through
the
atonement
of
christ
the
lord
and
becometh
as
a
child
submissive
meek
humble
patient
full
of
love
willing
to
submit
to
all
things
which
the
lord
seeth
fit
to
inflict
upon
him
even
as
a
child
doth
submit
to
his
father

and
moreover
i
say
unto
you
that
the
time
shall
come
when
the
knowledge
of
the
savior
shall
spread
throughout
every
nation
kindred
tongue
and
people

and
behold
when
that
time
cometh
none
shall
be
found
blameless
before
god
except
it
be
little
children
only
through
repentance
and
faith
on
the
name
of
the
lord
god
omnipotent

and
even
at
this
time
when
thou
shalt
have
taught
thy
people
the
things
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
commanded
thee
even
then
are
they
found
no
more
blameless
in
the
sight
of
god
only
according
to
the
words
which
i
have
spoken
unto
thee

and
now
i
have
spoken
the
words
which
the
lord
god
hath
commanded
me

and
thus
saith
the
lord
they
shall
stand
as
a
bright
testimony
against
this
people
at
the
judgment
day
whereof
they
shall
be
judged
every
man
according
to
his
works
whether
they
be
good
or
whether
they
be
evil

and
if
they
be
evil
they
are
consigned
to
an
awful
view
of
their
own
guilt
and
abominations
which
doth
cause
them
to
shrink
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
into
a
state
of
misery
and
endless
torment
from
whence
they
can
no
more
return
therefore
they
have
drunk
damnation
to
their
own
souls

therefore
they
have
drunk
out
of
the
cup
of
the
wrath
of
god
which
justice
could
no
more
deny
unto
them
than
it
could
deny
that
adam
should
fall
because
of
his
partaking
of
the
forbidden
fruit
therefore
mercy
could
have
claim
on
them
no
more
forever

and
their
torment
is
as
a
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
whose
flames
are
unquenchable
and
whose
smoke
ascendeth
up
forever
and
ever
thus
hath
the
lord
commanded
me

mosiah
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
king
benjamin
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
the
words
which
had
been
delivered
unto
him
by
the
angel
of
the
lord
that
he
cast
his
eyes
round
about
on
the
multitude
and
behold
they
had
fallen
to
the
earth
for
the
fear
of
the
lord
had
come
upon
them

and
they
had
viewed
themselves
in
their
own
carnal
state
even
less
than
the
dust
of
the
earth
and
they
all
cried
aloud
with
one
voice
saying
o
have
mercy
and
apply
the
atoning
blood
of
christ
that
we
may
receive
forgiveness
of
our
sins
and
our
hearts
may
be
purified
for
we
believe
in
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
who
created
heaven
and
earth
and
all
things
who
shall
come
down
among
the
children
of
men

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
they
had
spoken
these
words
the
spirit
of
the
lord
came
upon
them
and
they
were
filled
with
joy
having
received
a
remission
of
their
sins
and
having
peace
of
conscience
because
of
the
exceeding
faith
which
they
had
in
jesus
christ
who
should
come
according
to
the
words
which
king
benjamin
had
spoken
unto
them

and
king
benjamin
again
opened
his
mouth
and
began
to
speak
unto
them
saying
my
friends
and
my
brethren
my
kindred
and
my
people
i
would
again
call
your
attention
that
ye
may
hear
and
understand
the
remainder
of
my
words
which
i
shall
speak
unto
you

for
behold
if
the
knowledge
of
the
goodness
of
god
at
this
time
has
awakened
you
to
a
sense
of
your
nothingness
and
your
worthless
and
fallen
state

i
say
unto
you
if
ye
have
come
to
a
knowledge
of
the
goodness
of
god
and
his
matchless
power
and
his
wisdom
and
his
patience
and
his
longsuffering
towards
the
children
of
men
and
also
the
atonement
which
has
been
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
that
thereby
salvation
might
come
to
him
that
should
put
his
trust
in
the
lord
and
should
be
diligent
in
keeping
his
commandments
and
continue
in
the
faith
even
unto
the
end
of
his
life
i
mean
the
life
of
the
mortal
body

i
say
that
this
is
the
man
who
receiveth
salvation
through
the
atonement
which
was
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
for
all
mankind
which
ever
were
since
the
fall
of
adam
or
who
are
or
who
ever
shall
be
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world

and
this
is
the
means
whereby
salvation
cometh
and
there
is
none
other
salvation
save
this
which
hath
been
spoken
of
neither
are
there
any
conditions
whereby
man
can
be
saved
except
the
conditions
which
i
have
told
you

believe
in
god
believe
that
he
is
and
that
he
created
all
things
both
in
heaven
and
in
earth
believe
that
he
has
all
wisdom
and
all
power
both
in
heaven
and
in
earth
believe
that
man
doth
not
comprehend
all
the
things
which
the
lord
can
comprehend

and
again
believe
that
ye
must
repent
of
your
sins
and
forsake
them
and
humble
yourselves
before
god
and
ask
in
sincerity
of
heart
that
he
would
forgive
you
and
now
if
you
believe
all
these
things
see
that
ye
do
them

and
again
i
say
unto
you
as
i
have
said
before
that
as
ye
have
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
glory
of
god
or
if
ye
have
known
of
his
goodness
and
have
tasted
of
his
love
and
have
received
a
remission
of
your
sins
which
causeth
such
exceedingly
great
joy
in
your
souls
even
so
i
would
that
ye
should
remember
and
always
retain
in
remembrance
the
greatness
of
god
and
your
own
nothingness
and
his
goodness
and
longsuffering
towards
you
unworthy
creatures
and
humble
yourselves
even
in
the
depths
of
humility
calling
on
the
name
of
the
lord
daily
and
standing
steadfastly
in
the
faith
of
that
which
is
to
come
which
was
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
the
angel

and
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
if
ye
do
this
ye
shall
always
rejoice
and
be
filled
with
the
love
of
god
and
always
retain
a
remission
of
your
sins
and
ye
shall
grow
in
the
knowledge
of
the
glory
of
him
that
created
you
or
in
the
knowledge
of
that
which
is
just
and
true

and
ye
will
not
have
a
mind
to
injure
one
another
but
to
live
peaceably
and
to
render
to
every
man
according
to
that
which
is
his
due

and
ye
will
not
suffer
your
children
that
they
go
hungry
or
naked
neither
will
ye
suffer
that
they
transgress
the
laws
of
god
and
fight
and
quarrel
one
with
another
and
serve
the
devil
who
is
the
master
of
sin
or
who
is
the
evil
spirit
which
hath
been
spoken
of
by
our
fathers
he
being
an
enemy
to
all
righteousness

but
ye
will
teach
them
to
walk
in
the
ways
of
truth
and
soberness
ye
will
teach
them
to
love
one
another
and
to
serve
one
another

and
also
ye
yourselves
will
succor
those
that
stand
in
need
of
your
succor
ye
will
administer
of
your
substance
unto
him
that
standeth
in
need
and
ye
will
not
suffer
that
the
beggar
putteth
up
his
petition
to
you
in
vain
and
turn
him
out
to
perish

perhaps
thou
shalt
say
the
man
has
brought
upon
himself
his
misery
therefore
i
will
stay
my
hand
and
will
not
give
unto
him
of
my
food
nor
impart
unto
him
of
my
substance
that
he
may
not
suffer
for
his
punishments
are
just

but
i
say
unto
you
o
man
whosoever
doeth
this
the
same
hath
great
cause
to
repent
and
except
he
repenteth
of
that
which
he
hath
done
he
perisheth
forever
and
hath
no
interest
in
the
kingdom
of
god

for
behold
are
we
not
all
beggars
do
we
not
all
depend
upon
the
same
being
even
god
for
all
the
substance
which
we
have
for
both
food
and
raiment
and
for
gold
and
for
silver
and
for
all
the
riches
which
we
have
of
every
kind

and
behold
even
at
this
time
ye
have
been
calling
on
his
name
and
begging
for
a
remission
of
your
sins
and
has
he
suffered
that
ye
have
begged
in
vain
nay
he
has
poured
out
his
spirit
upon
you
and
has
caused
that
your
hearts
should
be
filled
with
joy
and
has
caused
that
your
mouths
should
be
stopped
that
ye
could
not
find
utterance
so
exceedingly
great
was
your
joy

and
now
if
god
who
has
created
you
on
whom
you
are
dependent
for
your
lives
and
for
all
that
ye
have
and
are
doth
grant
unto
you
whatsoever
ye
ask
that
is
right
in
faith
believing
that
ye
shall
receive
o
then
how
ye
ought
to
impart
of
the
substance
that
ye
have
one
to
another

and
if
ye
judge
the
man
who
putteth
up
his
petition
to
you
for
your
substance
that
he
perish
not
and
condemn
him
how
much
more
just
will
be
your
condemnation
for
withholding
your
substance
which
doth
not
belong
to
you
but
to
god
to
whom
also
your
life
belongeth
and
yet
ye
put
up
no
petition
nor
repent
of
the
thing
which
thou
hast
done

i
say
unto
you
wo
be
unto
that
man
for
his
substance
shall
perish
with
him
and
now
i
say
these
things
unto
those
who
are
rich
as
pertaining
to
the
things
of
this
world

and
again
i
say
unto
the
poor
ye
who
have
not
and
yet
have
sufficient
that
ye
remain
from
day
to
day
i
mean
all
you
who
deny
the
beggar
because
ye
have
not
i
would
that
ye
say
in
your
hearts
that
i
give
not
because
i
have
not
but
if
i
had
i
would
give

and
now
if
ye
say
this
in
your
hearts
ye
remain
guiltless
otherwise
ye
are
condemned
and
your
condemnation
is
just
for
ye
covet
that
which
ye
have
not
received

and
now
for
the
sake
of
these
things
which
i
have
spoken
unto
youthat
is
for
the
sake
of
retaining
a
remission
of
your
sins
from
day
to
day
that
ye
may
walk
guiltless
before
godi
would
that
ye
should
impart
of
your
substance
to
the
poor
every
man
according
to
that
which
he
hath
such
as
feeding
the
hungry
clothing
the
naked
visiting
the
sick
and
administering
to
their
relief
both
spiritually
and
temporally
according
to
their
wants

and
see
that
all
these
things
are
done
in
wisdom
and
order
for
it
is
not
requisite
that
a
man
should
run
faster
than
he
has
strength
and
again
it
is
expedient
that
he
should
be
diligent
that
thereby
he
might
win
the
prize
therefore
all
things
must
be
done
in
order

and
i
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
whosoever
among
you
borroweth
of
his
neighbor
should
return
the
thing
that
he
borroweth
according
as
he
doth
agree
or
else
thou
shalt
commit
sin
and
perhaps
thou
shalt
cause
thy
neighbor
to
commit
sin
also

and
finally
i
cannot
tell
you
all
the
things
whereby
ye
may
commit
sin
for
there
are
divers
ways
and
means
even
so
many
that
i
cannot
number
them

but
this
much
i
can
tell
you
that
if
ye
do
not
watch
yourselves
and
your
thoughts
and
your
words
and
your
deeds
and
observe
the
commandments
of
god
and
continue
in
the
faith
of
what
ye
have
heard
concerning
the
coming
of
our
lord
even
unto
the
end
of
your
lives
ye
must
perish
and
now
o
man
remember
and
perish
not
mosiah
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
king
benjamin
had
thus
spoken
to
his
people
he
sent
among
them
desiring
to
know
of
his
people
if
they
believed
the
words
which
he
had
spoken
unto
them

and
they
all
cried
with
one
voice
saying
yea
we
believe
all
the
words
which
thou
hast
spoken
unto
us
and
also
we
know
of
their
surety
and
truth
because
of
the
spirit
of
the
lord
omnipotent
which
has
wrought
a
mighty
change
in
us
or
in
our
hearts
that
we
have
no
more
disposition
to
do
evil
but
to
do
good
continually

and
we
ourselves
also
through
the
infinite
goodness
of
god
and
the
manifestations
of
his
spirit
have
great
views
of
that
which
is
to
come
and
were
it
expedient
we
could
prophesy
of
all
things

and
it
is
the
faith
which
we
have
had
on
the
things
which
our
king
has
spoken
unto
us
that
has
brought
us
to
this
great
knowledge
whereby
we
do
rejoice
with
such
exceedingly
great
joy

and
we
are
willing
to
enter
into
a
covenant
with
our
god
to
do
his
will
and
to
be
obedient
to
his
commandments
in
all
things
that
he
shall
command
us
all
the
remainder
of
our
days
that
we
may
not
bring
upon
ourselves
a
neverending
torment
as
has
been
spoken
by
the
angel
that
we
may
not
drink
out
of
the
cup
of
the
wrath
of
god

and
now
these
are
the
words
which
king
benjamin
desired
of
them
and
therefore
he
said
unto
them
ye
have
spoken
the
words
that
i
desired
and
the
covenant
which
ye
have
made
is
a
righteous
covenant

and
now
because
of
the
covenant
which
ye
have
made
ye
shall
be
called
the
children
of
christ
his
sons
and
his
daughters
for
behold
this
day
he
hath
spiritually
begotten
you
for
ye
say
that
your
hearts
are
changed
through
faith
on
his
name
therefore
ye
are
born
of
him
and
have
become
his
sons
and
his
daughters

and
under
this
head
ye
are
made
free
and
there
is
no
other
head
whereby
ye
can
be
made
free
there
is
no
other
name
given
whereby
salvation
cometh
therefore
i
would
that
ye
should
take
upon
you
the
name
of
christ
all
you
that
have
entered
into
the
covenant
with
god
that
ye
should
be
obedient
unto
the
end
of
your
lives

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whosoever
doeth
this
shall
be
found
at
the
right
hand
of
god
for
he
shall
know
the
name
by
which
he
is
called
for
he
shall
be
called
by
the
name
of
christ

and
now
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whosoever
shall
not
take
upon
him
the
name
of
christ
must
be
called
by
some
other
name
therefore
he
findeth
himself
on
the
left
hand
of
god

and
i
would
that
ye
should
remember
also
that
this
is
the
name
that
i
said
i
should
give
unto
you
that
never
should
be
blotted
out
except
it
be
through
transgression
therefore
take
heed
that
ye
do
not
transgress
that
the
name
be
not
blotted
out
of
your
hearts

i
say
unto
you
i
would
that
ye
should
remember
to
retain
the
name
written
always
in
your
hearts
that
ye
are
not
found
on
the
left
hand
of
god
but
that
ye
hear
and
know
the
voice
by
which
ye
shall
be
called
and
also
the
name
by
which
he
shall
call
you

for
how
knoweth
a
man
the
master
whom
he
has
not
served
and
who
is
a
stranger
unto
him
and
is
far
from
the
thoughts
and
intents
of
his
heart

and
again
doth
a
man
take
an
ass
which
belongeth
to
his
neighbor
and
keep
him
i
say
unto
you
nay
he
will
not
even
suffer
that
he
shall
feed
among
his

drive

away
and
cast
him
out
i
say
unto
you
that
even
so
shall
it
be
among
you
if
ye
know
not
the
name
by
which
ye
are
called

therefore
i
would
that
ye
should
be
steadfast
and
immovable
always
abounding
in
good
works
that
christ
the
lord
god
omnipotent
may
seal
you
his
that
you
may
be
brought
to

that
ye
may
have

through
the
wisdom
and
power
and
justice
and

of
him
who
created
all
things
in

and
in
earth
who
is

mosiah
chapter


and
now
king
benjamin
thought
it
was
expedient
after
having
finished
speaking
to
the
people
that
he
should
take
the
names
of
all
those
who
had
entered
into
a
covenant
with
god
to
keep
his
commandments

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
not
one
soul
except
it
were
little
children
but
who
had
entered
into
the
covenant
and
had
taken
upon
them
the
name
of
christ

and
again
it
came
to
pass
that
when
king
benjamin
had
made
an
end
of
all
these
things
and
had
consecrated
his
son
mosiah
to
be
a
ruler
and
a
king
over
his
people
and
had
given
him
all
the
charges
concerning
the
kingdom
and
also
had
appointed
priests
to
teach
the
people
that
thereby
they
might
hear
and
know
the
commandments
of
god
and
to
stir
them
up
in
remembrance
of
the
oath
which
they
had
made
he
dismissed
the
multitude
and
they
returned
every
one
according
to
their
families
to
their
own
houses

and
mosiah
began
to
reign
in
his
fathers
stead
and
he
began
to
reign
in
the
thirtieth
year
of
his
age
making
in
the
whole
about
four
hundred
and
seventysix
years
from
the
time
that
lehi
left
jerusalem

and
king
benjamin
lived
three
years
and
he
died

and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
mosiah
did
walk
in
the
ways
of
the
lord
and
did
observe
his
judgments
and
his
statutes
and
did
keep
his
commandments
in
all
things
whatsoever
he
commanded
him

and
king
mosiah
did
cause
his
people
that
they
should
till
the
earth
and
he
also
himself
did
till
the
earth
that
thereby
he
might
not
become
burdensome
to
his
people
that
he
might
do
according
to
that
which
his
father
had
done
in
all
things
and
there
was
no
contention
among
all
his
people
for
the
space
of
three
years
mosiah
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
king
mosiah
had
had
continual
peace
for
the
space
of
three
years
he
was
desirous
to
know
concerning
the
people
who
went
up
to
dwell
in
the
land
of
lehinephi
or
in
the
city
of
lehinephi
for
his
people
had
heard
nothing
from
them
from
the
time
they
left
the
land
of
zarahemla
therefore
they
wearied
him
with
their
teasings

and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
mosiah
granted
that
sixteen
of
their
strong
men
might
go
up
to
the
land
of
lehinephi
to
inquire
concerning
their
brethren

and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
they
started
to
go
up
having
with
them
one
ammon
he
being
a
strong
and
mighty
man
and
a
descendant
of
zarahemla
and
he
was
also
their
leader

and
now
they
knew
not
the
course
they
should
travel
in
the
wilderness
to
go
up
to
the
land
of
lehinephi
therefore
they
wandered
many
days
in
the
wilderness
even
forty
days
did
they
wander

and
when
they
had
wandered
forty
days
they
came
to
a
hill
which
is
north
of
the
land
of
shilom
and
there
they
pitched
their
tents

and
ammon
took
three
of
his
brethren
and
their
names
were
amaleki
helem
and
hem
and
they
went
down
into
the
land
of
nephi

and
behold
they
met
the
king
of
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
of
nephi
and
in
the
land
of
shilom
and
they
were
surrounded
by
the
kings
guard
and
were
taken
and
were
bound
and
were
committed
to
prison

and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
had
been
in
prison
two
days
they
were
again
brought
before
the
king
and
their
bands
were
loosed
and
they
stood
before
the
king
and
were
permitted
or
rather
commanded
that
they
should
answer
the
questions
which
he
should
ask
them

and
he
said
unto
them
behold
i
am
limhi
the
son
of
noah
who
was
the
son
of
zeniff
who
came
up
out
of
the
land
of
zarahemla
to
inherit
this
land
which
was
the
land
of
their
fathers
who
was
made
a
king
by
the
voice
of
the
people

and
now
i
desire
to
know
the
cause
whereby
ye
were
so
bold
as
to
come
near
the
walls
of
the
city
when
i
myself
was
with
my
guards
without
the
gate

and
now
for
this
cause
have
i
suffered
that
ye
should
be
preserved
that
i
might
inquire
of
you
or
else
i
should
have
caused
that
my
guards
should
have
put
you
to
death
ye
are
permitted
to
speak

and
now
when
ammon
saw
that
he
was
permitted
to
speak
he
went
forth
and
bowed
himself
before
the
king
and
rising
again
he
said
o
king
i
am
very
thankful
before
god
this
day
that
i
am
yet
alive
and
am
permitted
to
speak
and
i
will
endeavor
to
speak
with
boldness

for
i
am
assured
that
if
ye
had
known
me
ye
would
not
have
suffered
that
i
should
have
worn
these
bands
for
i
am
ammon
and
am
a
descendant
of
zarahemla
and
have
come
up
out
of
the
land
of
zarahemla
to
inquire
concerning
our
brethren
whom
zeniff
brought
up
out
of
that
land

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
limhi
had
heard
the
words
of
ammon
he
was
exceedingly
glad
and
said
now
i
know
of
a
surety
that
my
brethren
who
were
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
are
yet
alive
and
now
i
will
rejoice
and
on
the
morrow
i
will
cause
that
my
people
shall
rejoice
also

for
behold
we
are
in
bondage
to
the
lamanites
and
are
taxed
with
a
tax
which
is
grievous
to
be
borne
and
now
behold
our
brethren
will
deliver
us
out
of
our
bondage
or
out
of
the
hands
of
the
lamanites
and
we
will
be
their
slaves
for
it
is
better
that
we
be
slaves
to
the
nephites
than
to
pay
tribute
to
the
king
of
the
lamanites

and
now
king
limhi
commanded
his
guards
that
they
should
no
more
bind
ammon
nor
his
brethren
but
caused
that
they
should
go
to
the
hill
which
was
north
of
shilom
and
bring
their
brethren
into
the
city
that
thereby
they
might
eat
and
drink
and
rest
themselves
from
the
labors
of
their
journey
for
they
had
suffered
many
things
they
had
suffered
hunger
thirst
and
fatigue

and
now
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
king
limhi
sent
a
proclamation
among
all
his
people
that
thereby
they
might
gather
themselves
together
to
the
temple
to
hear
the
words
which
he
should
speak
unto
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
gathered
themselves
together
that
he
spake
unto
them
in
this
wise
saying
o
ye
my
people
lift
up
your
heads
and
be
comforted
for
behold
the
time
is
at
hand
or
is
not
far
distant
when
we
shall
no
longer
be
in
subjection
to
our
enemies
notwithstanding
our
many
strugglings
which
have
been
in
vain
yet
i
trust
there
remaineth
an
effectual
struggle
to
be
made

therefore
lift
up
your
heads
and
rejoice
and
put
your
trust
in
god
in
that
god
who
was
the
god
of
abraham
and
isaac
and
jacob
and
also
that
god
who
brought
the
children
of
israel
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
caused
that
they
should
walk
through
the
red
sea
on
dry
ground
and
fed
them
with
manna
that
they
might
not
perish
in
the
wilderness
and
many
more
things
did
he
do
for
them

and
again
that
same
god
has
brought
our
fathers
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
has
kept
and
preserved
his
people
even
until
now
and
behold
it
is
because
of
our
iniquities
and
abominations
that
he
has
brought
us
into
bondage

and
ye
all
are
witnesses
this
day
that
zeniff
who
was
made
king
over
this
people
he
being
overzealous
to
inherit
the
land
of
his
fathers
therefore
being
deceived
by
the
cunning
and
craftiness
of
king
laman
who
having
entered
into
a
treaty
with
king
zeniff
and
having
yielded
up
into
his
hands
the
possessions
of
a
part
of
the
land
or
even
the
city
of
lehinephi
and
the
city
of
shilom
and
the
land
round
about

and
all
this
he
did
for
the
sole
purpose
of
bringing
this
people
into
subjection
or
into
bondage
and
behold
we
at
this
time
do
pay
tribute
to
the
king
of
the
lamanites
to
the
amount
of
one
half
of
our
corn
and
our
barley
and
even
all
our
grain
of
every
kind
and
one
half
of
the
increase
of
our
flocks
and
our
herds
and
even
one
half
of
all
we
have
or
possess
the
king
of
the
lamanites
doth
exact
of
us
or
our
lives

and
now
is
not
this
grievous
to
be
borne
and
is
not
this
our
affliction
great
now
behold
how
great
reason
we
have
to
mourn

yea
i
say
unto
you
great
are
the
reasons
which
we
have
to
mourn
for
behold
how
many
of
our
brethren
have
been
slain
and
their
blood
has
been
spilt
in
vain
and
all
because
of
iniquity

for
if
this
people
had
not
fallen
into
transgression
the
lord
would
not
have
suffered
that
this
great
evil
should
come
upon
them
but
behold
they
would
not
hearken
unto
his
words
but
there
arose
contentions
among
them
even
so
much
that
they
did
shed
blood
among
themselves

and
a
prophet
of
the
lord
have
they
slain
yea
a
chosen
man
of
god
who
told
them
of
their
wickedness
and
abominations
and
prophesied
of
many
things
which
are
to
come
yea
even
the
coming
of
christ

and
because
he
said
unto
them
that
christ
was
the
god
the
father
of
all
things
and
said
that
he
should
take
upon
him
the
image
of
man
and
it
should
be
the
image
after
which
man
was
created
in
the
beginning
or
in
other
words
he
said
that
man
was
created
after
the
image
of
god
and
that
god
should
come
down
among
the
children
of
men
and
take
upon
him
flesh
and
blood
and
go
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
earth

and
now
because
he
said
this
they
did
put
him
to
death
and
many
more
things
did
they
do
which
brought
down
the
wrath
of
god
upon
them
therefore
who
wondereth
that
they
are
in
bondage
and
that
they
are
smitten
with
sore
afflictions

for
behold
the
lord
hath
said
i
will
not
succor
my
people
in
the
day
of
their
transgression
but
i
will
hedge
up
their
ways
that
they
prosper
not
and
their
doings
shall
be
as
a
stumbling
block
before
them

and
again
he
saith
if
my
people
shall
sow
filthiness
they
shall
reap
the
chaff
thereof
in
the
whirlwind
and
the
effect
thereof
is
poison

and
again
he
saith
if
my
people
shall
sow
filthiness
they
shall
reap
the
east
wind
which
bringeth
immediate
destruction

and
now
behold
the
promise
of
the
lord
is
fulfilled
and
ye
are
smitten
and
afflicted

but
if
ye
will
turn
to
the
lord
with
full
purpose
of
heart
and
put
your
trust
in
him
and
serve
him
with
all
diligence
of
mind
if
ye
do
this
he
will
according
to
his
own
will
and
pleasure
deliver
you
out
of
bondage
mosiah
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
king
limhi
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
to
his
people
for
he
spake
many
things
unto
them
and
only
a
few
of
them
have
i
written
in
this
book
he
told
his
people
all
the
things
concerning
their
brethren
who
were
in
the
land
of
zarahemla

and
he
caused
that
ammon
should
stand
up
before
the
multitude
and
rehearse
unto
them
all
that
had
happened
unto
their
brethren
from
the
time
that
zeniff
went
up
out
of
the
land
even
until
the
time
that
he
himself
came
up
out
of
the
land

and
he
also
rehearsed
unto
them
the
last
words
which
king
benjamin
had
taught
them
and
explained
them
to
the
people
of
king
limhi
so
that
they
might
understand
all
the
words
which
he
spake

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
he
had
done
all
this
that
king
limhi
dismissed
the
multitude
and
caused
that
they
should
return
every
one
unto
his
own
house

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
caused
that
the
plates
which
contained
the
record
of
his
people
from
the
time
that
they
left
the
land
of
zarahemla
should
be
brought
before
ammon
that
he
might
read
them

now
as
soon
as
ammon
had
read
the
record
the
king
inquired
of
him
to
know
if
he
could
interpret
languages
and
ammon
told
him
that
he
could
not

and
the
king
said
unto
him
being
grieved
for
the
afflictions
of
my
people
i
caused
that
forty
and
three
of
my
people
should
take
a
journey
into
the
wilderness
that
thereby
they
might
find
the
land
of
zarahemla
that
we
might
appeal
unto
our
brethren
to
deliver
us
out
of
bondage

and
they
were
lost
in
the
wilderness
for
the
space
of
many
days
yet
they
were
diligent
and
found
not
the
land
of
zarahemla
but
returned
to
this
land
having
traveled
in
a
land
among
many
waters
having
discovered
a
land
which
was
covered
with
bones
of
men
and
of
beasts
and
was
also
covered
with
ruins
of
buildings
of
every
kind
having
discovered
a
land
which
had
been
peopled
with
a
people
who
were
as
numerous
as
the
hosts
of
israel

and
for
a
testimony
that
the
things
that
they
had
said
are
true
they
have
brought
twentyfour
plates
which
are
filled
with
engravings
and
they
are
of
pure
gold

and
behold
also
they
have
brought
breastplates
which
are
large
and
they
are
of
brass
and
of
copper
and
are
perfectly
sound

and
again
they
have
brought
swords
the
hilts
thereof
have
perished
and
the
blades
thereof
were
cankered
with
rust
and
there
is
no
one
in
the
land
that
is
able
to
interpret
the
language
or
the
engravings
that
are
on
the
plates
therefore
i
said
unto
thee
canst
thou
translate

and
i
say
unto
thee
again
knowest
thou
of
any
one
that
can
translate
for
i
am
desirous
that
these
records
should
be
translated
into
our
language
for
perhaps
they
will
give
us
a
knowledge
of
a
remnant
of
the
people
who
have
been
destroyed
from
whence
these
records
came
or
perhaps
they
will
give
us
a
knowledge
of
this
very
people
who
have
been
destroyed
and
i
am
desirous
to
know
the
cause
of
their
destruction

now
ammon
said
unto
him
i
can
assuredly
tell
thee
o
king
of
a
man
that
can
translate
the
records
for
he
has
wherewith
that
he
can
look
and
translate
all
records
that
are
of
ancient
date
and
it
is
a
gift
from
god
and
the
things
are
called
interpreters
and
no
man
can
look
in
them
except
he
be
commanded
lest
he
should
look
for
that
he
ought
not
and
he
should
perish
and
whosoever
is
commanded
to
look
in
them
the
same
is
called
seer

and
behold
the
king
of
the
people
who
are
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
is
the
man
that
is
commanded
to
do
these
things
and
who
has
this
high
gift
from
god

and
the
king
said
that
a
seer
is
greater
than
a
prophet

and
ammon
said
that
a
seer
is
a
revelator
and
a
prophet
also
and
a
gift
which
is
greater
can
no
man
have
except
he
should
possess
the
power
of
god
which
no
man
can
yet
a
man
may
have
great
power
given
him
from
god

but
a
seer
can
know
of
things
which
are
past
and
also
of
things
which
are
to
come
and
by
them
shall
all
things
be
revealed
or
rather
shall
secret
things
be
made
manifest
and
hidden
things
shall
come
to
light
and
things
which
are
not
known
shall
be
made
known
by
them
and
also
things
shall
be
made
known
by
them
which
otherwise
could
not
be
known

thus
god
has
provided
a
means
that
man
through
faith
might
work
mighty
miracles
therefore
he
becometh
a
great
benefit
to
his
fellow
beings

and
now
when
ammon
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
these
words
the
king
rejoiced
exceedingly
and
gave
thanks
to
god
saying
doubtless
a
great
mystery
is
contained
within
these
plates
and
these
interpreters
were
doubtless
prepared
for
the
purpose
of
unfolding
all
such
mysteries
to
the
children
of
men

o
how
marvelous
are
the
works
of
the
lord
and
how
long
doth
he
suffer
with
his
people
yea
and
how
blind
and
impenetrable
are
the
understandings
of
the
children
of
men
for
they
will
not
seek
wisdom
neither
do
they
desire
that
she
should
rule
over
them

yea
they
are
as
a
wild
flock
which
fleeth
from
the
shepherd
and
scattereth
and
are
driven
and
are
devoured
by
the
beasts
of
the
forest

chapter


i
zeniff
having
been
taught
in
all
the
language
of
the
nephites
and
having
had
a
knowledge
of
the
land
of
nephi
or
of
the
land
of
our
fathers
first
inheritance
and
having
been
sent
as
a
spy
among
the
lamanites
that
i
might
spy
out
their
forces
that
our
army
might
come
upon
them
and
destroy
thembut
when
i
saw
that
which
was
good
among
them
i
was
desirous
that
they
should
not
be
destroyed

therefore
i
contended
with
my
brethren
in
the
wilderness
for
i
would
that
our
ruler
should
make
a
treaty
with
them
but
he
being
an
austere
and
a
bloodthirsty
man
commanded
that
i
should
be
slain
but
i
was
rescued
by
the
shedding
of
much
blood
for
father
fought
against
father
and
brother
against
brother
until
the
greater
number
of
our
army
was
destroyed
in
the
wilderness
and
we
returned
those
of
us
that
were
spared
to
the
land
of
zarahemla
to
relate
that
tale
to
their
wives
and
their
children

and
yet
i
being
overzealous
to
inherit
the
land
of
our
fathers
collected
as
many
as
were
desirous
to
go
up
to
possess
the
land
and
started
again
on
our
journey
into
the
wilderness
to
go
up
to
the
land
but
we
were
smitten
with
famine
and
sore
afflictions
for
we
were
slow
to
remember
the
lord
our
god

nevertheless
after
many
days
wandering
in
the
wilderness
we
pitched
our
tents
in
the
place
where
our
brethren
were
slain
which
was
near
to
the
land
of
our
fathers

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
went
again
with
four
of
my
men
into
the
city
in
unto
the
king
that
i
might
know
of
the
disposition
of
the
king
and
that
i
might
know
if
i
might
go
in
with
my
people
and
possess
the
land
in
peace

and
i
went
in
unto
the
king
and
he
covenanted
with
me
that
i
might
possess
the
land
of
lehinephi
and
the
land
of
shilom

and
he
also
commanded
that
his
people
should
depart
out
of
the
land
and
i
and
my
people
went
into
the
land
that
we
might
possess
it

and
we
began
to
build
buildings
and
to
repair
the
walls
of
the
city
yea
even
the
walls
of
the
city
of
lehinephi
and
the
city
of
shilom

and
we
began
to
till
the
ground
yea
even
with
all
manner
of
seeds
with
seeds
of
corn
and
of
wheat
and
of
barley
and
with
neas
and
with
sheum
and
with
seeds
of
all
manner
of
fruits
and
we
did
begin
to
multiply
and
prosper
in
the
land

now
it
was
the
cunning
and
the
craftiness
of
king
laman
to
bring
my
people
into
bondage
that
he
yielded
up
the
land
that
we
might
possess
it

therefore
it
came
to
pass
that
after
we
had
dwelt
in
the
land
for
the
space
of
twelve
years
that
king
laman
began
to
grow
uneasy
lest
by
any
means
my
people
should
wax
strong
in
the
land
and
that
they
could
not
overpower
them
and
bring
them
into
bondage

now
they
were
a
lazy
and
an
idolatrous
people
therefore
they
were
desirous
to
bring
us
into
bondage
that
they
might
glut
themselves
with
the
labors
of
our
hands
yea
that
they
might
feast
themselves
upon
the
flocks
of
our
fields

therefore
it
came
to
pass
that
king
laman
began
to
stir
up
his
people
that
they
should
contend
with
my
people
therefore
there
began
to
be
wars
and
contentions
in
the
land

for
in
the
thirteenth
year
of
my
reign
in
the
land
of
nephi
away
on
the
south
of
the
land
of
shilom
when
my
people
were
watering
and
feeding
their
flocks
and
tilling
their
lands
a
numerous
host
of
lamanites
came
upon
them
and
began
to
slay
them
and
to
take
off
their
flocks
and
the
corn
of
their
fields

yea
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
fled
all
that
were
not
overtaken
even
into
the
city
of
nephi
and
did
call
upon
me
for
protection

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
did
arm
them
with
bows
and
with
arrows
with
swords
and
with
cimeters
and
with
clubs
and
with
slings
and
with
all
manner
of
weapons
which
we
could
invent
and
i
and
my
people
did
go
forth
against
the
lamanites
to
battle

yea
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
did
we
go
forth
to
battle
against
the
lamanites
for
i
and
my
people
did
cry
mightily
to
the
lord
that
he
would
deliver
us
out
of
the
hands
of
our
enemies
for
we
were
awakened
to
a
remembrance
of
the
deliverance
of
our
fathers

and
god
did
hear
our
cries
and
did
answer
our
prayers
and
we
did
go
forth
in
his
might
yea
we
did
go
forth
against
the
lamanites
and
in
one
day
and
a
night
we
did
slay
three
thousand
and
fortythree
we
did
slay
them
even
until
we
had
driven
them
out
of
our
land

and
i
myself
with
mine
own
hands
did
help
to
bury
their
dead
and
behold
to
our
great
sorrow
and
lamentation
two
hundred
and
seventynine
of
our
brethren
were
slain
mosiah
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
again
began
to
establish
the
kingdom
and
we
again
began
to
possess
the
land
in
peace
and
i
caused
that
there
should
be
weapons
of
war
made
of
every
kind
that
thereby
i
might
have
weapons
for
my
people
against
the
time
the
lamanites
should
come
up
again
to
war
against
my
people

and
i
set
guards
round
about
the
land
that
the
lamanites
might
not
come
upon
us
again
unawares
and
destroy
us
and
thus
i
did
guard
my
people
and
my
flocks
and
keep
them
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
our
enemies

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
inherit
the
land
of
our
fathers
for
many
years
yea
for
the
space
of
twenty
and
two
years

and
i
did
cause
that
the
men
should
till
the
ground
and
raise
all
manner
of
grain
and
all
manner
of
fruit
of
every
kind

and
i
did
cause
that
the
women
should
spin
and
toil
and
work
and
work
all
manner
of
fine
linen
yea
and
cloth
of
every
kind
that
we
might
clothe
our
nakedness
and
thus
we
did
prosper
in
the
landthus
we
did
have
continual
peace
in
the
land
for
the
space
of
twenty
and
two
years

and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
laman
died
and
his
son
began
to
reign
in
his
stead
and
he
began
to
stir
his
people
up
in
rebellion
against
my
people
therefore
they
began
to
prepare
for
war
and
to
come
up
to
battle
against
my
people

but
i
had
sent
my
spies
out
round
about
the
land
of
shemlon
that
i
might
discover
their
preparations
that
i
might
guard
against
them
that
they
might
not
come
upon
my
people
and
destroy
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
came
up
upon
the
north
of
the
land
of
shilom
with
their
numerous
hosts
men
armed
with
bows
and
with
arrows
and
with
swords
and
with
cimeters
and
with
stones
and
with
slings
and
they
had
their
heads
shaved
that
they
were
naked
and
they
were
girded
with
a
leathern
girdle
about
their
loins

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
caused
that
the
women
and
children
of
my
people
should
be
hid
in
the
wilderness
and
i
also
caused
that
all
my
old
men
that
could
bear
arms
and
also
all
my
young
men
that
were
able
to
bear
arms
should
gather
themselves
together
to
go
to
battle
against
the
lamanites
and
i
did
place
them
in
their
ranks
every
man
according
to
his
age

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
go
up
to
battle
against
the
lamanites
and
i
even
i
in
my
old
age
did
go
up
to
battle
against
the
lamanites
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
go
up
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
to
battle

now
the
lamanites
knew
nothing
concerning
the
lord
nor
the
strength
of
the
lord
therefore
they
depended
upon
their
own
strength
yet
they
were
a
strong
people
as
to
the
strength
of
men

they
were
a
wild
and
ferocious
and
a
bloodthirsty
people
believing
in
the
tradition
of
their
fathers
which
is
thisbelieving
that
they
were
driven
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
because
of
the
iniquities
of
their
fathers
and
that
they
were
wronged
in
the
wilderness
by
their
brethren
and
they
were
also
wronged
while
crossing
the
sea

and
again
that
they
were
wronged
while
in
the
land
of
their
first
inheritance
after
they
had
crossed
the
sea
and
all
this
because
that
nephi
was
more
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
the
lordtherefore
he
was
favored
of
the
lord
for
the
lord
heard
his
prayers
and
answered
them
and
he
took
the
lead
of
their
journey
in
the
wilderness

and
his
brethren
were
wroth
with
him
because
they
understood
not
the
dealings
of
the
lord
they
were
also
wroth
with
him
upon
the
waters
because
they
hardened
their
hearts
against
the
lord

and
again
they
were
wroth
with
him
when
they
had
arrived
in
the
promised
land
because
they
said
that
he
had
taken
the
ruling
of
the
people
out
of
their
hands
and
they
sought
to
kill
him

and
again
they
were
wroth
with
him
because
he
departed
into
the
wilderness
as
the
lord
had
commanded
him
and
took
the
records
which
were
engraven
on
the
plates
of
brass
for
they
said
that
he
robbed
them

and
thus
they
have
taught
their
children
that
they
should
hate
them
and
that
they
should
murder
them
and
that
they
should
rob
and
plunder
them
and
do
all
they
could
to
destroy
them
therefore
they
have
an
eternal
hatred
towards
the
children
of
nephi

for
this
very
cause
has
king
laman
by
his
cunning
and
lying
craftiness
and
his
fair
promises
deceived
me
that
i
have
brought
this
my
people
up
into
this
land
that
they
may
destroy
them
yea
and
we
have
suffered
these
many
years
in
the
land

and
now
i
zeniff
after
having
told
all
these
things
unto
my
people
concerning
the
lamanites
i
did
stimulate
them
to
go
to
battle
with
their
might
putting
their
trust
in
the
lord
therefore
we
did
contend
with
them
face
to
face

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
drive
them
again
out
of
our
land
and
we
slew
them
with
a
great
slaughter
even
so
many
that
we
did
not
number
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
returned
again
to
our
own
land
and
my
people
again
began
to
tend
their
flocks
and
to
till
their
ground

and
now
i
being
old
did
confer
the
kingdom
upon
one
of
my
sons
therefore
i
say
no
more
and
may
the
lord
bless
my
people
amen
mosiah
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
zeniff
conferred
the
kingdom
upon
noah
one
of
his
sons
therefore
noah
began
to
reign
in
his
stead
and
he
did
not
walk
in
the
ways
of
his
father

for
behold
he
did
not
keep
the
commandments
of
god
but
he
did
walk
after
the
desires
of
his
own
heart
and
he
had
many
wives
and
concubines
and
he
did
cause
his
people
to
commit
sin
and
do
that
which
was
abominable
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
yea
and
they
did
commit
whoredoms
and
all
manner
of
wickedness

and
he
laid
a
tax
of
one
fifth
part
of
all
they
possessed
a
fifth
part
of
their
gold
and
of
their
silver
and
a
fifth
part
of
their
ziff
and
of
their
copper
and
of
their
brass
and
their
iron
and
a
fifth
part
of
their
fatlings
and
also
a
fifth
part
of
all
their
grain

and
all
this
did
he
take
to
support
himself
and
his
wives
and
his
concubines
and
also
his
priests
and
their
wives
and
their
concubines
thus
he
had
changed
the
affairs
of
the
kingdom

for
he
put
down
all
the
priests
that
had
been
consecrated
by
his
father
and
consecrated
new
ones
in
their
stead
such
as
were
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
hearts

yea
and
thus
they
were
supported
in
their
laziness
and
in
their
idolatry
and
in
their
whoredoms
by
the
taxes
which
king
noah
had
put
upon
his
people
thus
did
the
people
labor
exceedingly
to
support
iniquity

yea
and
they
also
became
idolatrous
because
they
were
deceived
by
the
vain
and
flattering
words
of
the
king
and
priests
for
they
did
speak
flattering
things
unto
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
noah
built
many
elegant
and
spacious
buildings
and
he
ornamented
them
with
fine
work
of
wood
and
of
all
manner
of
precious
things
of
gold
and
of
silver
and
of
iron
and
of
brass
and
of
ziff
and
of
copper

and
he
also
built
him
a
spacious
palace
and
a
throne
in
the
midst
thereof
all
of
which
was
of
fine
wood
and
was
ornamented
with
gold
and
silver
and
with
precious
things

and
he
also
caused
that
his
workmen
should
work
all
manner
of
fine
work
within
the
walls
of
the
temple
of
fine
wood
and
of
copper
and
of
brass

and
the
seats
which
were
set
apart
for
the
high
priests
which
were
above
all
the
other
seats
he
did
ornament
with
pure
gold
and
he
caused
a
breastwork
to
be
built
before
them
that
they
might
rest
their
bodies
and
their
arms
upon
while
they
should
speak
lying
and
vain
words
to
his
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
built
a
tower
near
the
temple
yea
a
very
high
tower
even
so
high
that
he
could
stand
upon
the
top
thereof
and
overlook
the
land
of
shilom
and
also
the
land
of
shemlon
which
was
possessed
by
the
lamanites
and
he
could
even
look
over
all
the
land
round
about

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
caused
many
buildings
to
be
built
in
the
land
shilom
and
he
caused
a
great
tower
to
be
built
on
the
hill
north
of
the
land
shilom
which
had
been
a
resort
for
the
children
of
nephi
at
the
time
they
fled
out
of
the
land
and
thus
he
did
do
with
the
riches
which
he
obtained
by
the
taxation
of
his
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
placed
his
heart
upon
his
riches
and
he
spent
his
time
in
riotous
living
with
his
wives
and
his
concubines
and
so
did
also
his
priests
spend
their
time
with
harlots

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
planted
vineyards
round
about
in
the
land
and
he
built
winepresses
and
made
wine
in
abundance
and
therefore
he
became
a
winebibber
and
also
his
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
began
to
come
in
upon
his
people
upon
small
numbers
and
to
slay
them
in
their
fields
and
while
they
were
tending
their
flocks

and
king
noah
sent
guards
round
about
the
land
to
keep
them
off
but
he
did
not
send
a
sufficient
number
and
the
lamanites
came
upon
them
and
killed
them
and
drove
many
of
their
flocks
out
of
the
land
thus
the
lamanites
began
to
destroy
them
and
to
exercise
their
hatred
upon
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
noah
sent
his
armies
against
them
and
they
were
driven
back
or
they
drove
them
back
for
a
time
therefore
they
returned
rejoicing
in
their
spoil

and
now
because
of
this
great
victory
they
were
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
hearts
they
did
boast
in
their
own
strength
saying
that
their
fifty
could
stand
against
thousands
of
the
lamanites
and
thus
they
did
boast
and
did
delight
in
blood
and
the
shedding
of
the
blood
of
their
brethren
and
this
because
of
the
wickedness
of
their
king
and
priests

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
a
man
among
them
whose
name
was
abinadi
and
he
went
forth
among
them
and
began
to
prophesy
saying
behold
thus
saith
the
lord
and
thus
hath
he
commanded
me
saying
go
forth
and
say
unto
this
people
thus
saith
the
lordwo
be
unto
this
people
for
i
have
seen
their
abominations
and
their
wickedness
and
their
whoredoms
and
except
they
repent
i
will
visit
them
in
mine
anger

and
except
they
repent
and
turn
to
the
lord
their
god
behold
i
will
deliver
them
into
the
hands
of
their
enemies
yea
and
they
shall
be
brought
into
bondage
and
they
shall
be
afflicted
by
the
hand
of
their
enemies

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
they
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
their
god
and
am
a
jealous
god
visiting
the
iniquities
of
my
people

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
except
this
people
repent
and
turn
unto
the
lord
their
god
they
shall
be
brought
into
bondage
and
none
shall
deliver
them
except
it
be
the
lord
the
almighty
god

yea
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
they
shall
cry
unto
me
i
will
be
slow
to
hear
their
cries
yea
and
i
will
suffer
them
that
they
be
smitten
by
their
enemies

and
except
they
repent
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
and
cry
mightily
to
the
lord
their
god
i
will
not
hear
their
prayers
neither
will
i
deliver
them
out
of
their
afflictions
and
thus
saith
the
lord
and
thus
hath
he
commanded
me

now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
abinadi
had
spoken
these
words
unto
them
they
were
wroth
with
him
and
sought
to
take
away
his
life
but
the
lord
delivered
him
out
of
their
hands

now
when
king
noah
had
heard
of
the
words
which
abinadi
had
spoken
unto
the
people
he
was
also
wroth
and
he
said
who
is
abinadi
that
i
and
my
people
should
be
judged
of
him
or
who
is
the
lord
that
shall
bring
upon
my
people
such
great
affliction

i
command
you
to
bring
abinadi
hither
that
i
may
slay
him
for
he
has
said
these
things
that
he
might
stir
up
my
people
to
anger
one
with
another
and
to
raise
contentions
among
my
people
therefore
i
will
slay
him

now
the
eyes
of
the
people
were
blinded
therefore
they
hardened
their
hearts
against
the
words
of
abinadi
and
they
sought
from
that
time
forward
to
take
him
and
king
noah
hardened
his
heart
against
the
word
of
the
lord
and
he
did
not
repent
of
his
evil
doings
mosiah
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
space
of
two
years
that
abinadi
came
among
them
in
disguise
that
they
knew
him
not
and
began
to
prophesy
among
them
saying
thus
has
the
lord
commanded
me
sayingabinadi
go
and
prophesy
unto
this
my
people
for
they
have
hardened
their
hearts
against
my
words
they
have
repented
not
of
their
evil
doings
therefore
i
will
visit
them
in
my
anger
yea
in
my
fierce
anger
will
i
visit
them
in
their
iniquities
and
abominations

yea
wo
be
unto
this
generation
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
stretch
forth
thy
hand
and
prophesy
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
this
generation
because
of
their
iniquities
shall
be
brought
into
bondage
and
shall
be
smitten
on
the
cheek
yea
and
shall
be
driven
by
men
and
shall
be
slain
and
the
vultures
of
the
air
and
the
dogs
yea
and
the
wild
beasts
shall
devour
their
flesh

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
life
of
king
noah
shall
be
valued
even
as
a
garment
in
a
hot
furnace
for
he
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
i
will
smite
this
my
people
with
sore
afflictions
yea
with
famine
and
with
pestilence
and
i
will
cause
that
they
shall
howl
all
the
day
long

yea
and
i
will
cause
that
they
shall
have
burdens
lashed
upon
their
backs
and
they
shall
be
driven
before
like
a
dumb
ass

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
i
will
send
forth
hail
among
them
and
it
shall
smite
them
and
they
shall
also
be
smitten
with
the
east
wind
and
insects
shall
pester
their
land
also
and
devour
their
grain

and
they
shall
be
smitten
with
a
great
pestilenceand
all
this
will
i
do
because
of
their
iniquities
and
abominations

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
except
they
repent
i
will
utterly
destroy
them
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
yet
they
shall
leave
a
record
behind
them
and
i
will
preserve
them
for
other
nations
which
shall
possess
the
land
yea
even
this
will
i
do
that
i
may
discover
the
abominations
of
this
people
to
other
nations
and
many
things
did
abinadi
prophesy
against
this
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
angry
with
him
and
they
took
him
and
carried
him
bound
before
the
king
and
said
unto
the
king
behold
we
have
brought
a
man
before
thee
who
has
prophesied
evil
concerning
thy
people
and
saith
that
god
will
destroy
them

and
he
also
prophesieth
evil
concerning
thy
life
and
saith
that
thy
life
shall
be
as
a
garment
in
a
furnace
of
fire

and
again
he
saith
that
thou
shalt
be
as
a
stalk
even
as
a
dry
stalk
of
the
field
which
is
run
over
by
the
beasts
and
trodden
under
foot

and
again
he
saith
thou
shalt
be
as
the
blossoms
of
a
thistle
which
when
it
is
fully
ripe
if
the
wind
bloweth
it
is
driven
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
land
and
he
pretendeth
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
and
he
saith
all
this
shall
come
upon
thee
except
thou
repent
and
this
because
of
thine
iniquities

and
now
o
king
what
great
evil
hast
thou
done
or
what
great
sins
have
thy
people
committed
that
we
should
be
condemned
of
god
or
judged
of
this
man

and
now
o
king
behold
we
are
guiltless
and
thou
o
king
hast
not
sinned
therefore
this
man
has
lied
concerning
you
and
he
has
prophesied
in
vain

and
behold
we
are
strong
we
shall
not
come
into
bondage
or
be
taken
captive
by
our
enemies
yea
and
thou
hast
prospered
in
the
land
and
thou
shalt
also
prosper

behold
here
is
the
man
we
deliver
him
into
thy
hands
thou
mayest
do
with
him
as
seemeth
thee
good

and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
noah
caused
that
abinadi
should
be
cast
into
prison
and
he
commanded
that
the
priests
should
gather
themselves
together
that
he
might
hold
a
council
with
them
what
he
should
do
with
him

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
said
unto
the
king
bring
him
hither
that
we
may
question
him
and
the
king
commanded
that
he
should
be
brought
before
them

and
they
began
to
question
him
that
they
might
cross
him
that
thereby
they
might
have
wherewith
to
accuse
him
but
he
answered
them
boldly
and
withstood
all
their
questions
yea
to
their
astonishment
for
he
did
withstand
them
in
all
their
questions
and
did
confound
them
in
all
their
words

and
it
came
to
pass
that
one
of
them
said
unto
him
what
meaneth
the
words
which
are
written
and
which
have
been
taught
by
our
fathers
saying

how
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
are
the
feet
of
him
that
bringeth
good
tidings
that
publisheth
peace
that
bringeth
good
tidings
of
good
that
publisheth
salvation
that
saith
unto
zion
thy
god
reigneth

thy
watchmen
shall
lift
up
the
voice
with
the
voice
together
shall
they
sing
for
they
shall
see
eye
to
eye
when
the
lord
shall
bring
again
zion

break
forth
into
joy
sing
together
ye
waste
places
of
jerusalem
for
the
lord
hath
comforted
his
people
he
hath
redeemed
jerusalem

the
lord
hath
made
bare
his
holy
arm
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
nations
and
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
shall
see
the
salvation
of
our
god

and
now
abinadi
said
unto
them
are
you
priests
and
pretend
to
teach
this
people
and
to
understand
the
spirit
of
prophesying
and
yet
desire
to
know
of
me
what
these
things
mean

i
say
unto
you
wo
be
unto
you
for
perverting
the
ways
of
the
lord
for
if
ye
understand
these
things
ye
have
not
taught
them
therefore
ye
have
perverted
the
ways
of
the
lord

ye
have
not
applied
your
hearts
to
understanding
therefore
ye
have
not
been
wise
therefore
what
teach
ye
this
people

and
they
said
we
teach
the
law
of
moses

and
again
he
said
unto
them
if
ye
teach
the
law
of
moses
why
do
ye
not
keep
it
why
do
ye
set
your
hearts
upon
riches
why
do
ye
commit
whoredoms
and
spend
your
strength
with
harlots
yea
and
cause
this
people
to
commit
sin
that
the
lord
has
cause
to
send
me
to
prophesy
against
this
people
yea
even
a
great
evil
against
this
people

know
ye
not
that
i
speak
the
truth
yea
ye
know
that
i
speak
the
truth
and
you
ought
to
tremble
before
god

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
ye
shall
be
smitten
for
your
iniquities
for
ye
have
said
that
ye
teach
the
law
of
moses
and
what
know
ye
concerning
the
law
of
moses
doth
salvation
come
by
the
law
of
moses
what
say
ye

and
they
answered
and
said
that
salvation
did
come
by
the
law
of
moses

but
now
abinadi
said
unto
them
i
know
if
ye
keep
the
commandments
of
god
ye
shall
be
saved
yea
if
ye
keep
the
commandments
which
the
lord
delivered
unto
moses
in
the
mount
of
sinai
saying

i
am
the
lord
thy
god
who
hath
brought
thee
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
out
of
the
house
of
bondage

thou
shalt
have
no
other
god
before
me

thou
shalt
not
make
unto
thee
any
graven
image
or
any
likeness
of
any
thing
in
heaven
above
or
things
which
are
in
the
earth
beneath

now
abinadi
said
unto
them
have
ye
done
all
this
i
say
unto
you
nay
ye
have
not
and
have
ye
taught
this
people
that
they
should
do
all
these
things
i
say
unto
you
nay
ye
have
not
mosiah
chapter


and
now
when
the
king
had
heard
these
words
he
said
unto
his
priests
away
with
this
fellow
and
slay
him
for
what
have
we
to
do
with
him
for
he
is
mad

and
they
stood
forth
and
attempted
to
lay
their
hands
on
him
but
he
withstood
them
and
said
unto
them

touch
me
not
for
god
shall
smite
you
if
ye
lay
your
hands
upon
me
for
i
have
not
delivered
the
message
which
the
lord
sent
me
to
deliver
neither
have
i
told
you
that
which
ye
requested
that
i
should
tell
therefore
god
will
not
suffer
that
i
shall
be
destroyed
at
this
time

but
i
must
fulfil
the
commandments
wherewith
god
has
commanded
me
and
because
i
have
told
you
the
truth
ye
are
angry
with
me
and
again
because
i
have
spoken
the
word
of
god
ye
have
judged
me
that
i
am
mad

now
it
came
to
pass
after
abinadi
had
spoken
these
words
that
the
people
of
king
noah
durst
not
lay
their
hands
on
him
for
the
spirit
of
the
lord
was
upon
him
and
his
face
shone
with
exceeding
luster
even
as
moses
did
while
in
the
mount
of
sinai
while
speaking
with
the
lord

and
he
spake
with
power
and
authority
from
god
and
he
continued
his
words
saying

ye
see
that
ye
have
not
power
to
slay
me
therefore
i
finish
my
message
yea
and
i
perceive
that
it
cuts
you
to
your
hearts
because
i
tell
you
the
truth
concerning
your
iniquities

yea
and
my
words
fill
you
with
wonder
and
amazement
and
with
anger

but
i
finish
my
message
and
then
it
matters
not
whither
i
go
if
it
so
be
that
i
am
saved

but
this
much
i
tell
you
what
you
do
with
me
after
this
shall
be
as
a
type
and
a
shadow
of
things
which
are
to
come

and
now
i
read
unto
you
the
remainder
of
the
commandments
of
god
for
i
perceive
that
they
are
not
written
in
your
hearts
i
perceive
that
ye
have
studied
and
taught
iniquity
the
most
part
of
your
lives

and
now
ye
remember
that
i
said
unto
you
thou
shall
not
make
unto
thee
any
graven
image
or
any
likeness
of
things
which
are
in
heaven
above
or
which
are
in
the
earth
beneath
or
which
are
in
the
water
under
the
earth

and
again
thou
shalt
not
bow
down
thyself
unto
them
nor
serve
them
for
i
the
lord
thy
god
am
a
jealous
god
visiting
the
iniquities
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
unto
the
third
and
fourth
generations
of
them
that
hate
me

and
showing
mercy
unto
thousands
of
them
that
love
me
and
keep
my
commandments

thou
shalt
not
take
the
name
of
the
lord
thy
god
in
vain
for
the
lord
will
not
hold
him
guiltless
that
taketh
his
name
in
vain

remember
the
sabbath
day
to
keep
it
holy

six
days
shalt
thou
labor
and
do
all
thy
work

but
the
seventh
day
the
sabbath
of
the
lord
thy
god
thou
shalt
not
do
any
work
thou
nor
thy
son
nor
thy
daughter
thy
manservant
nor
thy
maidservant
nor
thy
cattle
nor
thy
stranger
that
is
within
thy
gates

for
in
six
days
the
lord
made
heaven
and
earth
and
the
sea
and
all
that
in
them
is
wherefore
the
lord
blessed
the
sabbath
day
and
hallowed
it

honor
thy
father
and
thy
mother
that
thy
days
may
be
long
upon
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee

thou
shalt
not
kill

thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
thou
shalt
not
steal

thou
shalt
not
bear
false
witness
against
thy
neighbor

thou
shalt
not
covet
thy
neighbors
house
thou
shalt
not
covet
thy
neighbors
wife
nor
his
manservant
nor
his
maidservant
nor
his
ox
nor
his
ass
nor
anything
that
is
thy
neighbors

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
abinadi
had
made
an
end
of
these
sayings
that
he
said
unto
them
have
ye
taught
this
people
that
they
should
observe
to
do
all
these
things
for
to
keep
these
commandments

i
say
unto
you
nay
for
if
ye
had
the
lord
would
not
have
caused
me
to
come
forth
and
to
prophesy
evil
concerning
this
people

and
now
ye
have
said
that
salvation
cometh
by
the
law
of
moses
i
say
unto
you
that
it
is
expedient
that
ye
should
keep
the
law
of
moses
as
yet
but
i
say
unto
you
that
the
time
shall
come
when
it
shall
no
more
be
expedient
to
keep
the
law
of
moses

and
moreover
i
say
unto
you
that
salvation
doth
not
come
by
the
law
alone
and
were
it
not
for
the
atonement
which
god
himself
shall
make
for
the
sins
and
iniquities
of
his
people
that
they
must
unavoidably
perish
notwithstanding
the
law
of
moses

and
now
i
say
unto
you
that
it
was
expedient
that
there
should
be
a
law
given
to
the
children
of
israel
yea
even
a
very
strict
law
for
they
were
a
stiffnecked
people
quick
to
do
iniquity
and
slow
to
remember
the
lord
their
god

therefore
there
was
a
law
given
them
yea
a
law
of
performances
and
of
ordinances
a
law
which
they
were
to
observe
strictly
from
day
to
day
to
keep
them
in
remembrance
of
god
and
their
duty
towards
him

but
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
all
these
things
were
types
of
things
to
come

and
now
did
they
understand
the
law
i
say
unto
you
nay
they
did
not
all
understand
the
law
and
this
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
for
they
understood
not
that
there
could
not
any
man
be
saved
except
it
were
through
the
redemption
of
god

for
behold
did
not
moses
prophesy
unto
them
concerning
the
coming
of
the
messiah
and
that
god
should
redeem
his
people
yea
and
even
all
the
prophets
who
have
prophesied
ever
since
the
world
beganhave
they
not
spoken
more
or
less
concerning
these
things

have
they
not
said
that
god
himself
should
come
down
among
the
children
of
men
and
take
upon
him
the
form
of
man
and
go
forth
in
mighty
power
upon
the
face
of
the
earth

yea
and
have
they
not
said
also
that
he
should
bring
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
that
he
himself
should
be
oppressed
and
afflicted
mosiah
chapter


yea
even
doth
not
isaiah
say
who
hath
believed
our
report
and
to
whom
is
the
arm
of
the
lord
revealed

for
he
shall
grow
up
before
him
as
a
tender
plant
and
as
a
root
out
of
dry
ground
he
hath
no
form
nor
comeliness
and
when
we
shall
see
him
there
is
no
beauty
that
we
should
desire
him

he
is
despised
and
rejected
of
men
a
man
of
sorrows
and
acquainted
with
grief
and
we
hid
as
it
were
our
faces
from
him
he
was
despised
and
we
esteemed
him
not

surely
he
has
borne
our
griefs
and
carried
our
sorrows
yet
we
did
esteem
him
stricken
smitten
of
god
and
afflicted

but
he
was
wounded
for
our
transgressions
he
was
bruised
for
our
iniquities
the
chastisement
of
our
peace
was
upon
him
and
with
his
stripes
we
are
healed

all
we
like
sheep
have
gone
astray
we
have
turned
every
one
to
his
own
way
and
the
lord
hath
laid
on
him
the
iniquities
of
us
all

he
was
oppressed
and
he
was
afflicted
yet
he
opened
not
his
mouth
he
is
brought
as
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
and
as
a
sheep
before
her
shearers
is
dumb
so
he
opened
not
his
mouth

he
was
taken
from
prison
and
from
judgment
and
who
shall
declare
his
generation
for
he
was
cut
off
out
of
the
land
of
the
living
for
the
transgressions
of
my
people
was
he
stricken

and
he
made
his
grave
with
the
wicked
and
with
the
rich
in
his
death
because
he
had
done
no
evil
neither
was
any
deceit
in
his
mouth

yet
it
pleased
the
lord
to
bruise
him
he
hath
put
him
to
grief
when
thou
shalt
make
his
soul
an
offering
for
sin
he
shall
see
his
seed
he
shall
prolong
his
days
and
the
pleasure
of
the
lord
shall
prosper
in
his
hand

he
shall
see
the
travail
of
his
soul
and
shall
be
satisfied
by
his
knowledge
shall
my
righteous
servant
justify
many
for
he
shall
bear
their
iniquities

therefore
will
i
divide
him
a
portion
with
the
great
and
he
shall
divide
the
spoil
with
the
strong
because
he
hath
poured
out
his
soul
unto
death
and
he
was
numbered
with
the
transgressors
and
he
bore
the
sins
of
many
and
made
intercession
for
the
transgressors
mosiah
chapter


and
now
abinadi
said
unto
them
i
would
that
ye
should
understand
that
god
himself
shall
come
down
among
the
children
of
men
and
shall
redeem
his
people

and
because
he
dwelleth
in
flesh
he
shall
be
called
the
son
of
god
and
having
subjected
the
flesh
to
the
will
of
the
father
being
the
father
and
the
son

the
father
because
he
was
conceived
by
the
power
of
god
and
the
son
because
of
the
flesh
thus
becoming
the
father
and
son

and
they
are
one
god
yea
the
very
eternal
father
of
heaven
and
of
earth

and
thus
the
flesh
becoming
subject
to
the
spirit
or
the
son
to
the
father
being
one
god
suffereth
temptation
and
yieldeth
not
to
the
temptation
but
suffereth
himself
to
be
mocked
and
scourged
and
cast
out
and
disowned
by
his
people

and
after
all
this
after
working
many
mighty
miracles
among
the
children
of
men
he
shall
be
led
yea
even
as
isaiah
said
as
a
sheep
before
the
shearer
is
dumb
so
he
opened
not
his
mouth

yea
even
so
he
shall
be
led
crucified
and
slain
the
flesh
becoming
subject
even
unto
death
the
will
of
the
son
being
swallowed
up
in
the
will
of
the
father

and
thus
god
breaketh
the
bands
of
death
having
gained
the
victory
over
death
giving
the
son
power
to
make
intercession
for
the
children
of
men

having
ascended
into
heaven
having
the
bowels
of
mercy
being
filled
with
compassion
towards
the
children
of
men
standing
betwixt
them
and
justice
having
broken
the
bands
of
death
taken
upon
himself
their
iniquity
and
their
transgressions
having
redeemed
them
and
satisfied
the
demands
of
justice

and
now
i
say
unto
you
who
shall
declare
his
generation
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
when
his
soul
has
been
made
an
offering
for
sin
he
shall
see
his
seed
and
now
what
say
ye
and
who
shall
be
his
seed

behold
i
say
unto
you
that
whosoever
has
heard
the
words
of
the
prophets
yea
all
the
holy
prophets
who
have
prophesied
concerning
the
coming
of
the
lordi
say
unto
you
that
all
those
who
have
hearkened
unto
their
words
and
believed
that
the
lord
would
redeem
his
people
and
have
looked
forward
to
that
day
for
a
remission
of
their
sins
i
say
unto
you
that
these
are
his
seed
or
they
are
heirs
of
the
kingdom
of
god

for
these
are
they
whose
sins
he
has
borne
these
are
they
for
whom
he
has
died
to
redeem
them
from
their
transgressions
and
now
are
they
not
his
seed

yea
and
are
not
the
prophets
every
one
that
has
opened
his
mouth
to
prophesy
that
has
not
fallen
into
transgression
i
mean
all
the
holy
prophets
ever
since
the
world
began
i
say
unto
you
that
they
are
his
seed

and
these
are
they
who
have
published
peace
who
have
brought
good
tidings
of
good
who
have
published
salvation
and
said
unto
zion
thy
god
reigneth

and
o
how
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
were
their
feet

and
again
how
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
are
the
feet
of
those
that
are
still
publishing
peace

and
again
how
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
are
the
feet
of
those
who
shall
hereafter
publish
peace
yea
from
this
time
henceforth
and
forever

and
behold
i
say
unto
you
this
is
not
all
for
o
how
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
are
the
feet
of
him
that
bringeth
good
tidings
that
is
the
founder
of
peace
yea
even
the
lord
who
has
redeemed
his
people
yea
him
who
has
granted
salvation
unto
his
people

for
were
it
not
for
the
redemption
which
he
hath
made
for
his
people
which
was
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
i
say
unto
you
were
it
not
for
this
all
mankind
must
have
perished

but
behold
the
bands
of
death
shall
be
broken
and
the
son
reigneth
and
hath
power
over
the
dead
therefore
he
bringeth
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead

and
there
cometh
a
resurrection
even
a
first
resurrection
yea
even
a
resurrection
of
those
that
have
been
and
who
are
and
who
shall
be
even
until
the
resurrection
of
christfor
so
shall
he
be
called

and
now
the
resurrection
of
all
the
prophets
and
all
those
that
have
believed
in
their
words
or
all
those
that
have
kept
the
commandments
of
god
shall
come
forth
in
the
first
resurrection
therefore
they
are
the
first
resurrection

they
are
raised
to
dwell
with
god
who
has
redeemed
them
thus
they
have
eternal
life
through
christ
who
has
broken
the
bands
of
death

and
these
are
those
who
have
part
in
the
first
resurrection
and
these
are
they
that
have
died
before
christ
came
in
their
ignorance
not
having
salvation
declared
unto
them
and
thus
the
lord
bringeth
about
the
restoration
of
these
and
they
have
a
part
in
the
first
resurrection
or
have
eternal
life
being
redeemed
by
the
lord

and
little
children
also
have
eternal
life

but
behold
and
fear
and
tremble
before
god
for
ye
ought
to
tremble
for
the
lord
redeemeth
none
such
that
rebel
against
him
and
die
in
their
sins
yea
even
all
those
that
have
perished
in
their
sins
ever
since
the
world
began
that
have
wilfully
rebelled
against
god
that
have
known
the
commandments
of
god
and
would
not
keep
them
these
are
they
that
have
no
part
in
the
first
resurrection

therefore
ought
ye
not
to
tremble
for
salvation
cometh
to
none
such
for
the
lord
hath
redeemed
none
such
yea
neither
can
the
lord
redeem
such
for
he
cannot
deny
himself
for
he
cannot
deny
justice
when
it
has
its
claim

and
now
i
say
unto
you
that
the
time
shall
come
that
the
salvation
of
the
lord
shall
be
declared
to
every
nation
kindred
tongue
and
people

yea
lord
thy
watchmen
shall
lift
up
their
voice
with
the
voice
together
shall
they
sing
for
they
shall
see
eye
to
eye
when
the
lord
shall
bring
again
zion

break
forth
into
joy
sing
together
ye
waste
places
of
jerusalem
for
the
lord
hath
comforted
his
people
he
hath
redeemed
jerusalem

the
lord
hath
made
bare
his
holy
arm
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
nations
and
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
shall
see
the
salvation
of
our
god
mosiah
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
abinadi
had
spoken
these
words
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
said
the
time
shall
come
when
all
shall
see
the
salvation
of
the
lord
when
every
nation
kindred
tongue
and
people
shall
see
eye
to
eye
and
shall
confess
before
god
that
his
judgments
are
just

and
then
shall
the
wicked
be
cast
out
and
they
shall
have
cause
to
howl
and
weep
and
wail
and
gnash
their
teeth
and
this
because
they
would
not
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
lord
therefore
the
lord
redeemeth
them
not

for
they
are
carnal
and
devilish
and
the
devil
has
power
over
them
yea
even
that
old
serpent
that
did
beguile
our
first
parents
which
was
the
cause
of
their
fall
which
was
the
cause
of
all
mankind
becoming
carnal
sensual
devilish
knowing
evil
from
good
subjecting
themselves
to
the
devil

thus
all
mankind
were
lost
and
behold
they
would
have
been
endlessly
lost
were
it
not
that
god
redeemed
his
people
from
their
lost
and
fallen
state

but
remember
that
he
that
persists
in
his
own
carnal
nature
and
goes
on
in
the
ways
of
sin
and
rebellion
against
god
remaineth
in
his
fallen
state
and
the
devil
hath
all
power
over
him
therefore
he
is
as
though
there
was
no
redemption
made
being
an
enemy
to
god
and
also
is
the
devil
an
enemy
to
god

and
now
if
christ
had
not
come
into
the
world
speaking
of
things
to
come
as
though
they
had
already
come
there
could
have
been
no
redemption

and
if
christ
had
not
risen
from
the
dead
or
have
broken
the
bands
of
death
that
the
grave
should
have
no
victory
and
that
death
should
have
no
sting
there
could
have
been
no
resurrection

but
there
is
a
resurrection
therefore
the
grave
hath
no
victory
and
the
sting
of
death
is
swallowed
up
in
christ

he
is
the
light
and
the
life
of
the
world
yea
a
light
that
is
endless
that
can
never
be
darkened
yea
and
also
a
life
which
is
endless
that
there
can
be
no
more
death

even
this
mortal
shall
put
on
immortality
and
this
corruption
shall
put
on
incorruption
and
shall
be
brought
to
stand
before
the
bar
of
god
to
be
judged
of
him
according
to
their
works
whether
they
be
good
or
whether
they
be
evil

if
they
be
good
to
the
resurrection
of
endless
life
and
happiness
and
if
they
be
evil
to
the
resurrection
of
endless
damnation
being
delivered
up
to
the
devil
who
hath
subjected
them
which
is
damnation

having
gone
according
to
their
own
carnal
wills
and
desires
having
never
called
upon
the
lord
while
the
arms
of
mercy
were
extended
towards
them
for
the
arms
of
mercy
were
extended
towards
them
and
they
would
not
they
being
warned
of
their
iniquities
and
yet
they
would
not
depart
from
them
and
they
were
commanded
to
repent
and
yet
they
would
not
repent

and
now
ought
ye
not
to
tremble
and
repent
of
your
sins
and
remember
that
only
in
and
through
christ
ye
can
be
saved

therefore
if
ye
teach
the
law
of
moses
also
teach
that
it
is
a
shadow
of
those
things
which
are
to
come

teach
them
that
redemption
cometh
through
christ
the
lord
who
is
the
very
eternal
father
amen
mosiah
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
abinadi
had
finished
these
sayings
that
the
king
commanded
that
the
priests
should
take
him
and
cause
that
he
should
be
put
to
death

but
there
was
one
among
them
whose
name
was
alma
he
also
being
a
descendant
of
nephi
and
he
was
a
young
man
and
he
believed
the
words
which
abinadi
had
spoken
for
he
knew
concerning
the
iniquity
which
abinadi
has
testified
against
them
therefore
he
began
to
plead
with
the
king
that
he
would
not
be
angry
with
abinadi
but
suffer
that
he
might
depart
in
peace

but
the
king
was
more
wroth
and
caused
that
alma
should
be
cast
out
from
among
them
and
sent
his
servants
after
him
that
they
might
slay
him

but
he
fled
from
before
them
and
hid
himself
that
they
found
him
not
and
he
being
concealed
for
many
days
did
write
all
the
words
which
abinadi
had
spoken

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
caused
that
his
guards
should
surround
abinadi
and
take
him
and
they
bound
him
and
cast
him
into
prison

and
after
three
days
having
counseled
with
his
priests
he
caused
that
he
should
again
be
brought
before
him

and
he
said
unto
him
abinadi
we
have
found
an
accusation
against
thee
and
thou
art
worthy
of
death

for
thou
hast
said
that
god
himself
should
come
down
among
the
children
of
men
and
now
for
this
cause
thou
shalt
be
put
to
death
unless
thou
wilt
recall
all
the
words
which
thou
hast
spoken
evil
concerning
me
and
my
people

now
abinadi
said
unto
him
i
say
unto
you
i
will
not
recall
the
words
which
i
have
spoken
unto
you
concerning
this
people
for
they
are
true
and
that
ye
may
know
of
their
surety
i
have
suffered
myself
that
i
have
fallen
into
your
hands

yea
and
i
will
suffer
even
until
death
and
i
will
not
recall
my
words
and
they
shall
stand
as
a
testimony
against
you
and
if
ye
slay
me
ye
will
shed
innocent
blood
and
this
shall
also
stand
as
a
testimony
against
you
at
the
last
day

and
now
king
noah
was
about
to
release
him
for
he
feared
his
word
for
he
feared
that
the
judgments
of
god
would
come
upon
him

but
the
priests
lifted
up
their
voices
against
him
and
began
to
accuse
him
saying
he
has
reviled
the
king
therefore
the
king
was
stirred
up
in
anger
against
him
and
he
delivered
him
up
that
he
might
be
slain

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
took
him
and
bound
him
and
scourged
his
skin
with
faggots
yea
even
unto
death

and
now
when
the
flames
began
to
scorch
him
he
cried
unto
them
saying

behold
even
as
ye
have
done
unto
me
so
shall
it
come
to
pass
that
thy
seed
shall
cause
that
many
shall
suffer
the
pains
that
i
do
suffer
even
the
pains
of
death
by
fire
and
this
because
they
believe
in
the
salvation
of
the
lord
their
god

and
it
will
come
to
pass
that
ye
shall
be
afflicted
with
all
manner
of
diseases
because
of
your
iniquities

yea
and
ye
shall
be
smitten
on
every
hand
and
shall
be
driven
and
scattered
to
and
fro
even
as
a
wild
flock
is
driven
by
wild
and
ferocious
beasts

and
in
that
day
ye
shall
be
hunted
and
ye
shall
be
taken
by
the
hand
of
your
enemies
and
then
ye
shall
suffer
as
i
suffer
the
pains
of
death
by
fire

thus
god
executeth
vengeance
upon
those
that
destroy
his
people
o
god
receive
my
soul

and
now
when
abinadi
had
said
these
words
he
fell
having
suffered
death
by
fire
yea
having
been
put
to
death
because
he
would
not
deny
the
commandments
of
god
having
sealed
the
truth
of
his
words
by
his
death
mosiah
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
who
had
fled
from
the
servants
of
king
noah
repented
of
his
sins
and
iniquities
and
went
about
privately
among
the
people
and
began
to
teach
the
words
of
abinadi

yea
concerning
that
which
was
to
come
and
also
concerning
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
the
redemption
of
the
people
which
was
to
be
brought
to
pass
through
the
power
and
sufferings
and
death
of
christ
and
his
resurrection
and
ascension
into
heaven

and
as
many
as
would
hear
his
word
he
did
teach
and
he
taught
them
privately
that
it
might
not
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
king
and
many
did
believe
his
words

and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
many
as
did
believe
him
did
go
forth
to
a
place
which
was
called
mormon
having
received
its
name
from
the
king
being
in
the
borders
of
the
land
having
been
infested
by
times
or
at
seasons
by
wild
beasts

now
there
was
in
mormon
a
fountain
of
pure
water
and
alma
resorted
thither
there
being
near
the
water
a
thicket
of
small
trees
where
he
did
hide
himself
in
the
daytime
from
the
searches
of
the
king

and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
many
as
believed
him
went
thither
to
hear
his
words

and
it
came
to
pass
after
many
days
there
were
a
goodly
number
gathered
together
at
the
place
of
mormon
to
hear
the
words
of
alma
yea
all
were
gathered
together
that
believed
on
his
word
to
hear
him
and
he
did
teach
them
and
did
preach
unto
them
repentance
and
redemption
and
faith
on
the
lord

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
unto
them
behold
here
are
the
waters
of
mormon
for
thus
were
they
called
and
now
as
ye
are
desirous
to
come
into
the
fold
of
god
and
to
be
called
his
people
and
are
willing
to
bear
one
anothers
burdens
that
they
may
be
light

yea
and
are
willing
to
mourn
with
those
that
mourn
yea
and
comfort
those
that
stand
in
need
of
comfort
and
to
stand
as
witnesses
of
god
at
all
times
and
in
all
things
and
in
all
places
that
ye
may
be
in
even
until
death
that
ye
may
be
redeemed
of
god
and
be
numbered
with
those
of
the
first
resurrection
that
ye
may
have
eternal
life

now
i
say
unto
you
if
this
be
the
desire
of
your
hearts
what
have
you
against
being
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
lord
as
a
witness
before
him
that
ye
have
entered
into
a
covenant
with
him
that
ye
will
serve
him
and
keep
his
commandments
that
he
may
pour
out
his
spirit
more
abundantly
upon
you

and
now
when
the
people
had
heard
these
words
they
clapped
their
hands
for
joy
and
exclaimed
this
is
the
desire
of
our
hearts

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
took
helam
he
being
one
of
the
first
and
went
and
stood
forth
in
the
water
and
cried
saying
o
lord
pour
out
thy
spirit
upon
thy
servant
that
he
may
do
this
work
with
holiness
of
heart

and
when
he
had
said
these
words
the
spirit
of
the
lord
was
upon
him
and
he
said
helam
i
baptize
thee
having
authority
from
the
almighty
god
as
a
testimony
that
ye
have
entered
into
a
covenant
to
serve
him
until
you
are
dead
as
to
the
mortal
body
and
may
the
spirit
of
the
lord
be
poured
out
upon
you
and
may
he
grant
unto
you
eternal
life
through
the
redemption
of
christ
whom
he
has
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world

and
after
alma
had
said
these
words
both
alma
and
helam
were
buried
in
the
water
and
they
arose
and
came
forth
out
of
the
water
rejoicing
being
filled
with
the
spirit

and
again
alma
took
another
and
went
forth
a
second
time
into
the
water
and
baptized
him
according
to
the
first
only
he
did
not
bury
himself
again
in
the
water

and
after
this
manner
he
did
baptize
every
one
that
went
forth
to
the
place
of
mormon
and
they
were
in
number
about
two
hundred
and
four
souls
yea
and
they
were
baptized
in
the
waters
of
mormon
and
were
filled
with
the
grace
of
god

and
they
were
called
the
church
of
god
or
the
church
of
christ
from
that
time
forward
and
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
was
baptized
by
the
power
and
authority
of
god
was
added
to
his
church

and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
having
authority
from
god
ordained
priests
even
one
priest
to
every
fifty
of
their
number
did
he
ordain
to
preach
unto
them
and
to
teach
them
concerning
the
things
pertaining
to
the
kingdom
of
god

and
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
teach
nothing
save
it
were
the
things
which
he
had
taught
and
which
had
been
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
the
holy
prophets

yea
even
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
preach
nothing
save
it
were
repentance
and
faith
on
the
lord
who
had
redeemed
his
people

and
he
commanded
them
that
there
should
be
no
contention
one
with
another
but
that
they
should
look
forward
with
one
eye
having
one
faith
and
one
baptism
having
their
hearts
knit
together
in
unity
and
in
love
one
towards
another

and
thus
he
commanded
them
to
preach
and
thus
they
became
the
children
of
god

and
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
observe
the
sabbath
day
and
keep
it
holy
and
also
every
day
they
should
give
thanks
to
the
lord
their
god

and
he
also
commanded
them
that
the
priests
whom
he
had
ordained
should
labor
with
their
own
hands
for
their
support

and
there
was
one
day
in
every
week
that
was
set
apart
that
they
should
gather
themselves
together
to
teach
the
people
and
to
worship
the
lord
their
god
and
also
as
often
as
it
was
in
their
power
to
assemble
themselves
together

and
the
priests
were
not
to
depend
upon
the
people
for
their
support
but
for
their
labor
they
were
to
receive
the
grace
of
god
that
they
might
wax
strong
in
the
spirit
having
the
knowledge
of
god
that
they
might
teach
with
power
and
authority
from
god

and
again
alma
commanded
that
the
people
of
the
church
should
impart
of
their
substance
every
one
according
to
that
which
he
had
if
he
have
more
abundantly
he
should
impart
more
abundantly
and
of
him
that
had
but
little
but
little
should
be
required
and
to
him
that
had
not
should
be
given

and
thus
they
should
impart
of
their
substance
of
their
own
free
will
and
good
desires
towards
god
and
to
those
priests
that
stood
in
need
yea
and
to
every
needy
naked
soul

and
this
he
said
unto
them
having
been
commanded
of
god
and
they
did
walk
uprightly
before
god
imparting
to
one
another
both
temporally
and
spiritually
according
to
their
needs
and
their
wants

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
all
this
was
done
in
mormon
yea
by
the
waters
of
mormon
in
the
forest
that
was
near
the
waters
of
mormon
yea
the
place
of
mormon
the
waters
of
mormon
the
forest
of
mormon
how
beautiful
are
they
to
the
eyes
of
them
who
there
came
to
the
knowledge
of
their
redeemer
yea
and
how
blessed
are
they
for
they
shall
sing
to
his
praise
forever

and
these
things
were
done
in
the
borders
of
the
land
that
they
might
not
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
king

but
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
having
discovered
a
movement
among
the
people
sent
his
servants
to
watch
them
therefore
on
the
day
that
they
were
assembling
themselves
together
to
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
they
were
discovered
unto
the
king

and
now
the
king
said
that
alma
was
stirring
up
the
people
to
rebellion
against
him
therefore
he
sent
his
army
to
destroy
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
and
the
people
of
the
lord
were
apprised
of
the
coming
of
the
kings
army
therefore
they
took
their
tents
and
their
families
and
departed
into
the
wilderness

and
they
were
in
number
about
four
hundred
and
fifty
souls
mosiah
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
army
of
the
king
returned
having
searched
in
vain
for
the
people
of
the
lord

and
now
behold
the
forces
of
the
king
were
small
having
been
reduced
and
there
began
to
be
a
division
among
the
remainder
of
the
people

and
the
lesser
part
began
to
breathe
out
threatenings
against
the
king
and
there
began
to
be
a
great
contention
among
them

and
now
there
was
a
man
among
them
whose
name
was
gideon
and
he
being
a
strong
man
and
an
enemy
to
the
king
therefore
he
drew
his
sword
and
swore
in
his
wrath
that
he
would
slay
the
king

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
fought
with
the
king
and
when
the
king
saw
that
he
was
about
to
overpower
him
he
fled
and
ran
and
got
upon
the
tower
which
was
near
the
temple

and
gideon
pursued
after
him
and
was
about
to
get
upon
the
tower
to
slay
the
king
and
the
king
cast
his
eyes
round
about
towards
the
land
of
shemlon
and
behold
the
army
of
the
lamanites
were
within
the
borders
of
the
land

and
now
the
king
cried
out
in
the
anguish
of
his
soul
saying
gideon
spare
me
for
the
lamanites
are
upon
us
and
they
will
destroy
us
yea
they
will
destroy
my
people

and
now
the
king
was
not
so
much
concerned
about
his
people
as
he
was
about
his
own
life
nevertheless
gideon
did
spare
his
life

and
the
king
commanded
the
people
that
they
should
flee
before
the
lamanites
and
he
himself
did
go
before
them
and
they
did
flee
into
the
wilderness
with
their
women
and
their
children

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
did
pursue
them
and
did
overtake
them
and
began
to
slay
them

now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
commanded
them
that
all
the
men
should
leave
their
wives
and
their
children
and
flee
before
the
lamanites

now
there
were
many
that
would
not
leave
them
but
had
rather
stay
and
perish
with
them
and
the
rest
left
their
wives
and
their
children
and
fled

and
it
came
to
pass
that
those
who
tarried
with
their
wives
and
their
children
caused
that
their
fair
daughters
should
stand
forth
and
plead
with
the
lamanites
that
they
would
not
slay
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
had
compassion
on
them
for
they
were
charmed
with
the
beauty
of
their
women

therefore
the
lamanites
did
spare
their
lives
and
took
them
captives
and
carried
them
back
to
the
land
of
nephi
and
granted
unto
them
that
they
might
possess
the
land
under
the
conditions
that
they
would
deliver
up
king
noah
into
the
hands
of
the
lamanites
and
deliver
up
their
property
even
one
half
of
all
they
possessed
one
half
of
their
gold
and
their
silver
and
all
their
precious
things
and
thus
they
should
pay
tribute
to
the
king
of
the
lamanites
from
year
to
year

and
now
there
was
one
of
the
sons
of
the
king
among
those
that
were
taken
captive
whose
name
was
limhi

and
now
limhi
was
desirous
that
his
father
should
not
be
destroyed
nevertheless
limhi
was
not
ignorant
of
the
iniquities
of
his
father
he
himself
being
a
just
man

and
it
came
to
pass
that
gideon
sent
men
into
the
wilderness
secretly
to
search
for
the
king
and
those
that
were
with
him
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
met
the
people
in
the
wilderness
all
save
the
king
and
his
priests

now
they
had
sworn
in
their
hearts
that
they
would
return
to
the
land
of
nephi
and
if
their
wives
and
their
children
were
slain
and
also
those
that
had
tarried
with
them
that
they
would
seek
revenge
and
also
perish
with
them

and
the
king
commanded
them
that
they
should
not
return
and
they
were
angry
with
the
king
and
caused
that
he
should
suffer
even
unto
death
by
fire

and
they
were
about
to
take
the
priests
also
and
put
them
to
death
and
they
fled
before
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
about
to
return
to
the
land
of
nephi
and
they
met
the
men
of
gideon
and
the
men
of
gideon
told
them
of
all
that
had
happened
to
their
wives
and
their
children
and
that
the
lamanites
had
granted
unto
them
that
they
might
possess
the
land
by
paying
a
tribute
to
the
lamanites
of
one
half
of
all
they
possessed

and
the
people
told
the
men
of
gideon
that
they
had
slain
the
king
and
his
priests
had
fled
from
them
farther
into
the
wilderness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
they
had
ended
the
ceremony
that
they
returned
to
the
land
of
nephi
rejoicing
because
their
wives
and
their
children
were
not
slain
and
they
told
gideon
what
they
had
done
to
the
king

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
of
the
lamanites
made
an
oath
unto
them
that
his
people
should
not
slay
them

and
also
limhi
being
the
son
of
the
king
having
the
kingdom
conferred
upon
him
by
the
people
made
oath
unto
the
king
of
the
lamanites
that
his
people
should
pay
tribute
unto
him
even
one
half
of
all
they
possessed

and
it
came
to
pass
that
limhi
began
to
establish
the
kingdom
and
to
establish
peace
among
his
people

and
the
king
of
the
lamanites
set
guards
round
about
the
land
that
he
might
keep
the
people
of
limhi
in
the
land
that
they
might
not
depart
into
the
wilderness
and
he
did
support
his
guards
out
of
the
tribute
which
he
did
receive
from
the
nephites

and
now
king
limhi
did
have
continual
peace
in
his
kingdom
for
the
space
of
two
years
that
the
lamanites
did
not
molest
them
nor
seek
to
destroy
them
mosiah
chapter


now
there
was
a
place
in
shemlon
where
the
daughters
of
the
lamanites
did
gather
themselves
together
to
sing
and
to
dance
and
to
make
themselves
merry

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
one
day
a
small
number
of
them
gathered
together
to
sing
and
to
dance

and
now
the
priests
of
king
noah
being
ashamed
to
return
to
the
city
of
nephi
yea
and
also
fearing
that
the
people
would
slay
them
therefore
they
durst
not
return
to
their
wives
and
their
children

and
having
tarried
in
the
wilderness
and
having
discovered
the
daughters
of
the
lamanites
they
laid
and
watched
them

and
when
there
were
but
few
of
them
gathered
together
to
dance
they
came
forth
out
of
their
secret
places
and
took
them
and
carried
them
into
the
wilderness
yea
twenty
and
four
of
the
daughters
of
the
lamanites
they
carried
into
the
wilderness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lamanites
found
that
their
daughters
had
been
missing
they
were
angry
with
the
people
of
limhi
for
they
thought
it
was
the
people
of
limhi

therefore
they
sent
their
armies
forth
yea
even
the
king
himself
went
before
his
people
and
they
went
up
to
the
land
of
nephi
to
destroy
the
people
of
limhi

and
now
limhi
had
discovered
them
from
the
tower
even
all
their
preparations
for
war
did
he
discover
therefore
he
gathered
his
people
together
and
laid
wait
for
them
in
the
fields
and
in
the
forests

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lamanites
had
come
up
that
the
people
of
limhi
began
to
fall
upon
them
from
their
waiting
places
and
began
to
slay
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
battle
became
exceedingly
sore
for
they
fought
like
lions
for
their
prey

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
limhi
began
to
drive
the
lamanites
before
them
yet
they
were
not
half
so
numerous
as
the
lamanites
but
they
fought
for
their
lives
and
for
their
wives
and
for
their
children
therefore
they
exerted
themselves
and
like
dragons
did
they
fight

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
found
the
king
of
the
lamanites
among
the
number
of
their
dead
yet
he
was
not
dead
having
been
wounded
and
left
upon
the
ground
so
speedy
was
the
flight
of
his
people

and
they
took
him
and
bound
up
his
wounds
and
brought
him
before
limhi
and
said
behold
here
is
the
king
of
the
lamanites
he
having
received
a
wound
has
fallen
among
their
dead
and
they
have
left
him
and
behold
we
have
brought
him
before
you
and
now
let
us
slay
him

but
limhi
said
unto
them
ye
shall
not
slay
him
but
bring
him
hither
that
i
may
see
him
and
they
brought
him
and
limhi
said
unto
him
what
cause
have
ye
to
come
up
to
war
against
my
people
behold
my
people
have
not
broken
the
oath
that
i
made
unto
you
therefore
why
should
ye
break
the
oath
which
ye
made
unto
my
people

and
now
the
king
said
i
have
broken
the
oath
because
thy
people
did
carry
away
the
daughters
of
my
people
therefore
in
my
anger
i
did
cause
my
people
to
come
up
to
war
against
thy
people

and
now
limhi
had
heard
nothing
concerning
this
matter
therefore
he
said
i
will
search
among
my
people
and
whosoever
has
done
this
thing
shall
perish
therefore
he
caused
a
search
to
be
made
among
his
people

now
when
gideon
had
heard
these
things
he
being
the
kings
captain
he
went
forth
and
said
unto
the
king
i
pray
thee
forbear
and
do
not
search
this
people
and
lay
not
this
thing
to
their
charge

for
do
ye
not
remember
the
priests
of
thy
father
whom
this
people
sought
to
destroy
and
are
they
not
in
the
wilderness
and
are
not
they
the
ones
who
have
stolen
the
daughters
of
the
lamanites

and
now
behold
and
tell
the
king
of
these
things
that
he
may
tell
his
people
that
they
may
be
pacified
towards
us
for
behold
they
are
already
preparing
to
come
against
us
and
behold
also
there
are
but
few
of
us

and
behold
they
come
with
their
numerous
hosts
and
except
the
king
doth
pacify
them
towards
us
we
must
perish

for
are
not
the
words
of
abinadi
fulfilled
which
he
prophesied
against
usand
all
this
because
we
would
not
hearken
unto
the
words
of
the
lord
and
turn
from
our
iniquities

and
now
let
us
pacify
the
king
and
we
fulfil
the
oath
which
we
have
made
unto
him
for
it
is
better
that
we
should
be
in
bondage
than
that
we
should
lose
our
lives
therefore
let
us
put
a
stop
to
the
shedding
of
so
much
blood

and
now
limhi
told
the
king
all
the
things
concerning
his
father
and
the
priests
that
had
fled
into
the
wilderness
and
attributed
the
carrying
away
of
their
daughters
to
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
was
pacified
towards
his
people
and
he
said
unto
them
let
us
go
forth
to
meet
my
people
without
arms
and
i
swear
unto
you
with
an
oath
that
my
people
shall
not
slay
thy
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
followed
the
king
and
went
forth
without
arms
to
meet
the
lamanites
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
meet
the
lamanites
and
the
king
of
the
lamanites
did
bow
himself
down
before
them
and
did
plead
in
behalf
of
the
people
of
limhi

and
when
the
lamanites
saw
the
people
of
limhi
that
they
were
without
arms
they
had
compassion
on
them
and
were
pacified
towards
them
and
returned
with
their
king
in
peace
to
their
own
land
mosiah
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
limhi
and
his
people
returned
to
the
city
of
nephi
and
began
to
dwell
in
the
land
again
in
peace

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
many
days
the
lamanites
began
again
to
be
stirred
up
in
anger
against
the
nephites
and
they
began
to
come
into
the
borders
of
the
land
round
about

now
they
durst
not
slay
them
because
of
the
oath
which
their
king
had
made
unto
limhi
but
they
would
smite
them
on
their
cheeks
and
exercise
authority
over
them
and
began
to
put
heavy
burdens
upon
their
backs
and
drive
them
as
they
would
a
dumb
ass

yea
all
this
was
done
that
the
word
of
the
lord
might
be
fulfilled

and
now
the
afflictions
of
the
nephites
were
great
and
there
was
no
way
that
they
could
deliver
themselves
out
of
their
hands
for
the
lamanites
had
surrounded
them
on
every
side

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
began
to
murmur
with
the
king
because
of
their
afflictions
and
they
began
to
be
desirous
to
go
against
them
to
battle
and
they
did
afflict
the
king
sorely
with
their
complaints
therefore
he
granted
unto
them
that
they
should
do
according
to
their
desires

and
they
gathered
themselves
together
again
and
put
on
their
armor
and
went
forth
against
the
lamanites
to
drive
them
out
of
their
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
did
beat
them
and
drove
them
back
and
slew
many
of
them

and
now
there
was
a
great
mourning
and
lamentation
among
the
people
of
limhi
the
widow
mourning
for
her
husband
the
son
and
the
daughter
mourning
for
their
father
and
the
brothers
for
their
brethren

now
there
were
a
great
many
widows
in
the
land
and
they
did
cry
mightily
from
day
to
day
for
a
great
fear
of
the
lamanites
had
come
upon
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
their
continual
cries
did
stir
up
the
remainder
of
the
people
of
limhi
to
anger
against
the
lamanites
and
they
went
again
to
battle
but
they
were
driven
back
again
suffering
much
loss

yea
they
went
again
even
the
third
time
and
suffered
in
the
like
manner
and
those
that
were
not
slain
returned
again
to
the
city
of
nephi

and
they
did
humble
themselves
even
to
the
dust
subjecting
themselves
to
the
yoke
of
bondage
submitting
themselves
to
be
smitten
and
to
be
driven
to
and
fro
and
burdened
according
to
the
desires
of
their
enemies

and
they
did
humble
themselves
even
in
the
depths
of
humility
and
they
did
cry
mightily
to
god
yea
even
all
the
day
long
did
they
cry
unto
their
god
that
he
would
deliver
them
out
of
their
afflictions

and
now
the
lord
was
slow
to
hear
their
cry
because
of
their
iniquities
nevertheless
the
lord
did
hear
their
cries
and
began
to
soften
the
hearts
of
the
lamanites
that
they
began
to
ease
their
burdens
yet
the
lord
did
not
see
fit
to
deliver
them
out
of
bondage

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
began
to
prosper
by
degrees
in
the
land
and
began
to
raise
grain
more
abundantly
and
flocks
and
herds
that
they
did
not
suffer
with
hunger

now
there
was
a
great
number
of
women
more
than
there
was
of
men
therefore
king
limhi
commanded
that
every
man
should
impart
to
the
support
of
the
widows
and
their
children
that
they
might
not
perish
with
hunger
and
this
they
did
because
of
the
greatness
of
their
number
that
had
been
slain

now
the
people
of
limhi
kept
together
in
a
body
as
much
as
it
was
possible
and
secured
their
grain
and
their
flocks

and
the
king
himself
did
not
trust
his
person
without
the
walls
of
the
city
unless
he
took
his
guards
with
him
fearing
that
he
might
by
some
means
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
lamanites

and
he
caused
that
his
people
should
watch
the
land
round
about
that
by
some
means
they
might
take
those
priests
that
fled
into
the
wilderness
who
had
stolen
the
daughters
of
the
lamanites
and
that
had
caused
such
a
great
destruction
to
come
upon
them

for
they
were
desirous
to
take
them
that
they
might
punish
them
for
they
had
come
into
the
land
of
nephi
by
night
and
carried
off
their
grain
and
many
of
their
precious
things
therefore
they
laid
wait
for
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
no
more
disturbance
between
the
lamanites
and
the
people
of
limhi
even
until
the
time
that
ammon
and
his
brethren
came
into
the
land

and
the
king
having
been
without
the
gates
of
the
city
with
his
guard
discovered
ammon
and
his
brethren
and
supposing
them
to
be
priests
of
noah
therefore
he
caused
that
they
should
be
taken
and
bound
and
cast
into
prison
and
had
they
been
the
priests
of
noah
he
would
have
caused
that
they
should
be
put
to
death

but
when
he
found
that
they
were
not
but
that
they
were
his
brethren
and
had
come
from
the
land
of
zarahemla
he
was
filled
with
exceedingly
great
joy

now
king
limhi
had
sent
previous
to
the
coming
of
ammon
a
small
number
of
men
to
search
for
the
land
of
zarahemla
but
they
could
not
find
it
and
they
were
lost
in
the
wilderness

nevertheless
they
did
find
a
land
which
had
been
peopled
yea
a
land
which
was
covered
with
dry
bones
yea
a
land
which
had
been
peopled
and
which
had
been
destroyed
and
they
having
supposed
it
to
be
the
land
of
zarahemla
returned
to
the
land
of
nephi
having
arrived
in
the
borders
of
the
land
not
many
days
before
the
coming
of
ammon

and
they
brought
a
record
with
them
even
a
record
of
the
people
whose
bones
they
had
found
and
it
was
engraven
on
plates
of
ore

and
now
limhi
was
again
filled
with
joy
in
learning
from
the
mouth
of
ammon
that
king
mosiah
had
a
gift
from
god
whereby
he
could
interpret
such
engravings
yea
and
ammon
also
did
rejoice

yet
ammon
and
his
brethren
were
filled
with
sorrow
because
so
many
of
their
brethren
had
been
slain

and
also
that
king
noah
and
his
priests
had
caused
the
people
to
commit
so
many
sins
and
iniquities
against
god
and
they
also
did
mourn
for
the
death
of
abinadi
and
also
for
the
departure
of
alma
and
the
people
that
went
with
him
who
had
formed
a
church
of
god
through
the
strength
and
power
of
god
and
faith
on
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
by
abinadi

yea
they
did
mourn
for
their
departure
for
they
knew
not
whither
they
had
fled
now
they
would
have
gladly
joined
with
them
for
they
themselves
had
entered
into
a
covenant
with
god
to
serve
him
and
keep
his
commandments

and
now
since
the
coming
of
ammon
king
limhi
had
also
entered
into
a
covenant
with
god
and
also
many
of
his
people
to
serve
him
and
keep
his
commandments

and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
limhi
and
many
of
his
people
were
desirous
to
be
baptized
but
there
was
none
in
the
land
that
had
authority
from
god
and
ammon
declined
doing
this
thing
considering
himself
an
unworthy
servant

therefore
they
did
not
at
that
time
form
themselves
into
a
church
waiting
upon
the
spirit
of
the
lord
now
they
were
desirous
to
become
even
as
alma
and
his
brethren
who
had
fled
into
the
wilderness

they
were
desirous
to
be
baptized
as
a
witness
and
a
testimony
that
they
were
willing
to
serve
god
with
all
their
hearts
nevertheless
they
did
prolong
the
time
and
an
account
of
their
baptism
shall
be
given
hereafter

and
now
all
the
study
of
ammon
and
his
people
and
king
limhi
and
his
people
was
to
deliver
themselves
out
of
the
hands
of
the
lamanites
and
from
bondage
mosiah
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
ammon
and
king
limhi
began
to
consult
with
the
people
how
they
should
deliver
themselves
out
of
bondage
and
even
they
did
cause
that
all
the
people
should
gather
themselves
together
and
this
they
did
that
they
might
have
the
voice
of
the
people
concerning
the
matter

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
could
find
no
way
to
deliver
themselves
out
of
bondage
except
it
were
to
take
their
women
and
children
and
their
flocks
and
their
herds
and
their
tents
and
depart
into
the
wilderness
for
the
lamanites
being
so
numerous
it
was
impossible
for
the
people
of
limhi
to
contend
with
them
thinking
to
deliver
themselves
out
of
bondage
by
the
sword

now
it
came
to
pass
that
gideon
went
forth
and
stood
before
the
king
and
said
unto
him
now
o
king
thou
hast
hitherto
hearkened
unto
my
words
many
times
when
we
have
been
contending
with
our
brethren
the
lamanites

and
now
o
king
if
thou
hast
not
found
me
to
be
an
unprofitable
servant
or
if
thou
hast
hitherto
listened
to
my
words
in
any
degree
and
they
have
been
of
service
to
thee
even
so
i
desire
that
thou
wouldst
listen
to
my
words
at
this
time
and
i
will
be
thy
servant
and
deliver
this
people
out
of
bondage

and
the
king
granted
unto
him
that
he
might
speak
and
gideon
said
unto
him

behold
the
back
pass
through
the
back
wall
on
the
back
side
of
the
city
the
lamanites
or
the
guards
of
the
lamanites
by
night
are
drunken
therefore
let
us
send
a
proclamation
among
all
this
people
that
they
gather
together
their
flocks
and
herds
that
they
may
drive
them
into
the
wilderness
by
night

and
i
will
go
according
to
thy
command
and
pay
the
last
tribute
of
wine
to
the
lamanites
and
they
will
be
drunken
and
we
will
pass
through
the
secret
pass
on
the
left
of
their
camp
when
they
are
drunken
and
asleep

thus
we
will
depart
with
our
women
and
our
children
our
flocks
and
our
herds
into
the
wilderness
and
we
will
travel
around
the
land
of
shilom

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
hearkened
unto
the
words
of
gideon

and
king
limhi
caused
that
his
people
should
gather
their
flocks
together
and
he
sent
the
tribute
of
wine
to
the
lamanites
and
he
also
sent
more
wine
as
a
present
unto
them
and
they
did
drink
freely
of
the
wine
which
king
limhi
did
send
unto
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
king
limhi
did
depart
by
night
into
the
wilderness
with
their
flocks
and
their
herds
and
they
went
round
about
the
land
of
shilom
in
the
wilderness
and
bent
their
course
towards
the
land
of
zarahemla
being
led
by
ammon
and
his
brethren

and
they
had
taken
all
their
gold
and
silver
and
their
precious
things
which
they
could
carry
and
also
their
provisions
with
them
into
the
wilderness
and
they
pursued
their
journey

and
after
being
many
days
in
the
wilderness
they
arrived
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
joined
mosiahs
people
and
became
his
subjects

and
it
came
to
pass
that
mosiah
received
them
with
joy
and
he
also
received
their
records
and
also
the
records
which
had
been
found
by
the
people
of
limhi

and
now
it
came
to
pass
when
the
lamanites
had
found
that
the
people
of
limhi
had
departed
out
of
the
land
by
night
that
they
sent
an
army
into
the
wilderness
to
pursue
them

and
after
they
had
pursued
them
two
days
they
could
no
longer
follow
their
tracks
therefore
they
were
lost
in
the
wilderness
mosiah
chapter


now
alma
having
been
warned
of
the
lord
that
the
armies
of
king
noah
would
come
upon
them
and
having
made
it
known
to
his
people
therefore
they
gathered
together
their
flocks
and
took
of
their
grain
and
departed
into
the
wilderness
before
the
armies
of
king
noah

and
the
lord
did
strengthen
them
that
the
people
of
king
noah
could
not
overtake
them
to
destroy
them

and
they
fled
eight
days
journey
into
the
wilderness

and
they
came
to
a
land
yea
even
a
very
beautiful
and
pleasant
land
a
land
of
pure
water

and
they
pitched
their
tents
and
began
to
till
the
ground
and
began
to
build
buildings
yea
they
were
industrious
and
did
labor
exceedingly

and
the
people
were
desirous
that
alma
should
be
their
king
for
he
was
beloved
by
his
people

but
he
said
unto
them
behold
it
is
not
expedient
that
we
should
have
a
king
for
thus
saith
the
lord
ye
shall
not
esteem
one
flesh
above
another
or
one
man
shall
not
think
himself
above
another
therefore
i
say
unto
you
it
is
not
expedient
that
ye
should
have
a
king

nevertheless
if
it
were
possible
that
ye
could
always
have
just
men
to
be
your
kings
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
have
a
king

but
remember
the
iniquity
of
king
noah
and
his
priests
and
i
myself
was
caught
in
a
snare
and
did
many
things
which
were
abominable
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
which
caused
me
sore
repentance

nevertheless
after
much
tribulation
the
lord
did
hear
my
cries
and
did
answer
my
prayers
and
has
made
me
an
instrument
in
his
hands
in
bringing
so
many
of
you
to
a
knowledge
of
his
truth

nevertheless
in
this
i
do
not
glory
for
i
am
unworthy
to
glory
of
myself

and
now
i
say
unto
you
ye
have
been
oppressed
by
king
noah
and
have
been
in
bondage
to
him
and
his
priests
and
have
been
brought
into
iniquity
by
them
therefore
ye
were
bound
with
the
bands
of
iniquity

and
now
as
ye
have
been
delivered
by
the
power
of
god
out
of
these
bonds
yea
even
out
of
the
hands
of
king
noah
and
his
people
and
also
from
the
bonds
of
iniquity
even
so
i
desire
that
ye
should
stand
fast
in
this
liberty
wherewith
ye
have
been
made
free
and
that
ye
trust
no
man
to
be
a
king
over
you

and
also
trust
no
one
to
be
your
teacher
nor
your
minister
except
he
be
a
man
of
god
walking
in
his
ways
and
keeping
his
commandments

thus
did
alma
teach
his
people
that
every
man
should
love
his
neighbor
as
himself
that
there
should
be
no
contention
among
them

and
now
alma
was
their
high
priest
he
being
the
founder
of
their
church

and
it
came
to
pass
that
none
received
authority
to
preach
or
to
teach
except
it
were
by
him
from
god
therefore
he
consecrated
all
their
priests
and
all
their
teachers
and
none
were
consecrated
except
they
were
just
men

therefore
they
did
watch
over
their
people
and
did
nourish
them
with
things
pertaining
to
righteousness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
began
to
prosper
exceedingly
in
the
land
and
they
called
the
land
helam

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
multiply
and
prosper
exceedingly
in
the
land
of
helam
and
they
built
a
city
which
they
called
the
city
of
helam

nevertheless
the
lord
seeth
fit
to
chasten
his
people
yea
he
trieth
their
patience
and
their
faith

neverthelesswhosoever
putteth
his
trust
in
him
the
same
shall
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day
yea
and
thus
it
was
with
this
people

for
behold
i
will
show
unto
you
that
they
were
brought
into
bondage
and
none
could
deliver
them
but
the
lord
their
god
yea
even
the
god
of
abraham
and
isaac
and
of
jacob

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
deliver
them
and
he
did
show
forth
his
mighty
power
unto
them
and
great
were
their
rejoicings

for
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
while
they
were
in
the
land
of
helam
yea
in
the
city
of
helam
while
tilling
the
land
round
about
behold
an
army
of
the
lamanites
was
in
the
borders
of
the
land

now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brethren
of
alma
fled
from
their
fields
and
gathered
themselves
together
in
the
city
of
helam
and
they
were
much
frightened
because
of
the
appearance
of
the
lamanites

but
alma
went
forth
and
stood
among
them
and
exhorted
them
that
they
should
not
be
frightened
but
that
they
should
remember
the
lord
their
god
and
he
would
deliver
them

therefore
they
hushed
their
fears
and
began
to
cry
unto
the
lord
that
he
would
soften
the
hearts
of
the
lamanites
that
they
would
spare
them
and
their
wives
and
their
children

and
it
came
to
pass
the
the
lord
did
soften
the
hearts
of
the
lamanites
and
alma
and
his
brethren
went
forth
and
delivered
themselves
up
into
their
hands
and
the
lamanites
took
possession
of
the
land
of
helam

now
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
which
had
followed
after
the
people
of
king
limhi
had
been
lost
in
the
wilderness
for
many
days

and
behold
they
had
found
those
priests
of
king
noah
in
a
place
which
they
called
amulon
and
they
had
begun
to
possess
the
land
of
amulon
and
had
begun
to
till
the
ground

now
the
name
of
the
leader
of
those
priests
was
amulon

and
it
came
to
pass
that
amulon
did
plead
with
the
lamanites
and
he
also
sent
forth
their
wives
who
were
the
daughters
of
the
lamanites
to
plead
with
their
brethren
that
they
should
not
destroy
their
husbands

and
the
lamanites
had
compassion
on
amulon
and
his
brethren
and
did
not
destroy
them
because
of
their
wives

and
amulon
and
his
brethren
did
join
the
lamanites
and
they
were
traveling
in
the
wilderness
in
search
of
the
land
of
nephi
when
they
discovered
the
land
of
helam
which
was
possessed
by
alma
and
his
brethren

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
promised
unto
alma
and
his
brethren
that
if
they
would
show
them
the
way
which
led
to
the
land
of
nephi
that
they
would
grant
unto
them
their
lives
and
their
liberty

but
after
alma
had
shown
them
the
way
that
led
to
the
land
of
nephi
the
lamanites
would
not
keep
their
promise
but
they
set
guards
round
about
the
land
of
helam
over
alma
and
his
brethren

and
the
remainder
of
them
went
to
the
land
of
nephi
and
a
part
of
them
returned
to
the
land
of
helam
and
also
brought
with
them
the
wives
and
the
children
of
the
guards
who
had
been
left
in
the
land

and
the
king
of
the
lamanites
had
granted
unto
amulon
that
he
should
be
a
king
and
a
ruler
over
his
people
who
were
in
the
land
of
helam
nevertheless
he
should
have
no
power
to
do
anything
contrary
to
the
will
of
the
king
of
the
lamanites
mosiah
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
amulon
did
gain
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
king
of
the
lamanites
therefore
the
king
of
the
lamanites
granted
unto
him
and
his
brethren
that
they
should
be
appointed
teachers
over
his
people
yea
even
over
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
of
shemlon
and
in
the
land
of
shilom
and
in
the
land
of
amulon

for
the
lamanites
had
taken
possession
of
all
these
lands
therefore
the
king
of
the
lamanites
had
appointed
kings
over
all
these
lands

and
now
the
name
of
the
king
of
the
lamanites
was
laman
being
called
after
the
name
of
his
father
and
therefore
he
was
called
king
laman
and
he
was
king
over
a
numerous
people

and
he
appointed
teachers
of
the
brethren
of
amulon
in
every
land
which
was
possessed
by
his
people
and
thus
the
language
of
nephi
began
to
be
taught
among
all
the
people
of
the
lamanites

and
they
were
a
people
friendly
one
with
another
nevertheless
they
knew
not
god
neither
did
the
brethren
of
amulon
teach
them
anything
concerning
the
lord
their
god
neither
the
law
of
moses
nor
did
they
teach
them
the
words
of
abinadi

but
they
taught
them
that
they
should
keep
their
record
and
that
they
might
write
one
to
another

and
thus
the
lamanites
began
to
increase
in
riches
and
began
to
trade
one
with
another
and
wax
great
and
began
to
be
a
cunning
and
a
wise
people
as
to
the
wisdom
of
the
world
yea
a
very
cunning
people
delighting
in
all
manner
of
wickedness
and
plunder
except
it
were
among
their
own
brethren

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
amulon
began
to
exercise
authority
over
alma
and
his
brethren
and
began
to
persecute
him
and
cause
that
his
children
should
persecute
their
children

for
amulon
knew
alma
that
he
had
been
one
of
the
kings
priests
and
that
it
was
he
that
believed
the
words
of
abinadi
and
was
driven
out
before
the
king
and
therefore
he
was
wroth
with
him
for
he
was
subject
to
king
laman
yet
he
exercised
authority
over
them
and
put
tasks
upon
them
and
put
taskmasters
over
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
so
great
were
their
afflictions
that
they
began
to
cry
mightily
to
god

and
amulon
commanded
them
that
they
should
stop
their
cries
and
he
put
guards
over
them
to
watch
them
that
whosoever
should
be
found
calling
upon
god
should
be
put
to
death

and
alma
and
his
people
did
not
raise
their
voices
to
the
lord
their
god
but
did
pour
out
their
hearts
to
him
and
he
did
know
the
thoughts
of
their
hearts

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
to
them
in
their
afflictions
saying
lift
up
your
heads
and
be
of
good
comfort
for
i
know
of
the
covenant
which
ye
have
made
unto
me
and
i
will
covenant
with
my
people
and
deliver
them
out
of
bondage

and
i
will
also
ease
the
burdens
which
are
put
upon
your
shoulders
that
even
you
cannot
feel
them
upon
your
backs
even
while
you
are
in
bondage
and
this
will
i
do
that
ye
may
stand
as
witnesses
for
me
hereafter
and
that
ye
may
know
of
a
surety
that
i
the
lord
god
do
visit
my
people
in
their
afflictions

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
burdens
which
were
laid
upon
alma
and
his
brethren
were
made
light
yea
the
lord
did
strengthen
them
that
they
could
bear
up
their
burdens
with
ease
and
they
did
submit
cheerfully
and
with
patience
to
all
the
will
of
the
lord

and
it
came
to
pass
that
so
great
was
their
faith
and
their
patience
that
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
unto
them
again
saying
be
of
good
comfort
for
on
the
morrow
i
will
deliver
you
out
of
bondage

and
he
said
unto
alma
thou
shalt
go
before
this
people
and
i
will
go
with
thee
and
deliver
this
people
out
of
bondage

now
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
and
his
people
in
the
nighttime
gathered
their
flocks
together
and
also
of
their
grain
yea
even
all
the
nighttime
were
they
gathering
the
flocks
together

and
in
the
morning
the
lord
caused
a
deep
sleep
to
come
upon
the
lamanites
yea
and
all
their
taskmasters
were
in
a
profound
sleep

and
alma
and
his
people
departed
into
the
wilderness
and
when
they
had
traveled
all
day
they
pitched
their
tents
in
a
valley
and
they
called
the
valley
alma
because
he
led
their
way
in
the
wilderness

yea
and
in
the
valley
of
alma
they
poured
out
their
thanks
to
god
because
he
had
been
merciful
unto
them
and
eased
their
burdens
and
had
delivered
them
out
of
bondage
for
they
were
in
bondage
and
none
could
deliver
them
except
it
were
the
lord
their
god

and
they
gave
thanks
to
god
yea
all
their
men
and
all
their
women
and
all
their
children
that
could
speak
lifted
their
voices
in
the
praises
of
their
god

and
now
the
lord
said
unto
alma
haste
thee
and
get
thou
and
this
people
out
of
this
land
for
the
lamanites
have
awakened
and
do
pursue
thee
therefore
get
thee
out
of
this
land
and
i
will
stop
the
lamanites
in
this
valley
that
they
come
no
further
in
pursuit
of
this
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
departed
out
of
the
valley
and
took
their
journey
into
the
wilderness

and
after
they
had
been
in
the
wilderness
twelve
days
they
arrived
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
king
mosiah
did
also
receive
them
with
joy
mosiah
chapter


and
now
king
mosiah
caused
that
all
the
people
should
be
gathered
together

now
there
were
not
so
many
of
the
children
of
nephi
or
so
many
of
those
who
were
descendants
of
nephi
as
there
were
of
the
people
of
zarahemla
who
was
a
descendant
of
mulek
and
those
who
came
with
him
into
the
wilderness

and
there
were
not
so
many
of
the
people
of
nephi
and
of
the
people
of
zarahemla
as
there
were
of
the
lamanites
yea
they
were
not
half
so
numerous

and
now
all
the
people
of
nephi
were
assembled
together
and
also
all
the
people
of
zarahemla
and
they
were
gathered
together
in
two
bodies

and
it
came
to
pass
that
mosiah
did
read
and
caused
to
be
read
the
records
of
zeniff
to
his
people
yea
he
read
the
records
of
the
people
of
zeniff
from
the
time
they
left
the
land
of
zarahemla
until
they
returned
again

and
he
also
read
the
account
of
alma
and
his
brethren
and
all
their
afflictions
from
the
time
they
left
the
land
of
zarahemla
until
the
time
they
returned
again

and
now
when
mosiah
had
made
an
end
of
reading
the
records
his
people
who
tarried
in
the
land
were
struck
with
wonder
and
amazement

for
they
knew
not
what
to
think
for
when
they
beheld
those
that
had
been
delivered
out
of
bondage
they
were
filled
with
exceedingly
great
joy

and
again
when
they
thought
of
their
brethren
who
had
been
slain
by
the
lamanites
they
were
filled
with
sorrow
and
even
shed
many
tears
of
sorrow

and
again
when
they
thought
of
the
immediate
goodness
of
god
and
his
power
in
delivering
alma
and
his
brethren
out
of
the
hands
of
the
lamanites
and
of
bondage
they
did
raise
their
voices
and
give
thanks
to
god

and
again
when
they
thought
upon
the
lamanites
who
were
their
brethren
of
their
sinful
and
polluted
state
they
were
filled
with
pain
and
anguish
for
the
welfare
of
their
souls

and
it
came
to
pass
that
those
who
were
the
children
of
amulon
and
his
brethren
who
had
taken
to
wife
the
daughters
of
the
lamanites
were
displeased
with
the
conduct
of
their
fathers
and
they
would
no
longer
be
called
by
the
names
of
their
fathers
therefore
they
took
upon
themselves
the
name
of
nephi
that
they
might
be
called
the
children
of
nephi
and
be
numbered
among
those
who
were
called
nephites

and
now
all
the
people
of
zarahemla
were
numbered
with
the
nephites
and
this
because
the
kingdom
had
been
conferred
upon
none
but
those
who
were
descendants
of
nephi

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
mosiah
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
and
reading
to
the
people
he
desired
that
alma
should
also
speak
to
the
people

and
alma
did
speak
unto
them
when
they
were
assembled
together
in
large
bodies
and
he
went
from
one
body
to
another
preaching
unto
the
people
repentance
and
faith
on
the
lord

and
he
did
exhort
the
people
of
limhi
and
his
brethren
all
those
that
had
been
delivered
out
of
bondage
that
they
should
remember
that
it
was
the
lord
that
did
deliver
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
alma
had
taught
the
people
many
things
and
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
to
them
that
king
limhi
was
desirous
that
he
might
be
baptized
and
all
his
people
were
desirous
that
they
might
be
baptized
also

therefore
alma
did
go
forth
into
the
water
and
did
baptize
them
yea
he
did
baptize
them
after
the
manner
he
did
his
brethren
in
the
waters
of
mormon
yea
and
as
many
as
he
did
baptize
did
belong
to
the
church
of
god
and
this
because
of
their
belief
on
the
words
of
alma

and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
mosiah
granted
unto
alma
that
he
might
establish
churches
throughout
all
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
gave
him
power
to
ordain
priests
and
teachers
over
every
church

now
this
was
done
because
there
were
so
many
people
that
they
could
not
all
be
governed
by
one
teacher
neither
could
they
all
hear
the
word
of
god
in
one
assembly

therefore
they
did
assemble
themselves
together
in
different
bodies
being
called
churches
every
church
having
their
priests
and
their
teachers
and
every
priest
preaching
the
word
according
as
it
was
delivered
to
him
by
the
mouth
of
alma

and
thus
notwithstanding
there
being
many
churches
they
were
all
one
church
yea
even
the
church
of
god
for
there
was
nothing
preached
in
all
the
churches
except
it
were
repentance
and
faith
in
god

and
now
there
were
seven
churches
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
were
desirous
to
take
upon
them
the
name
of
christ
or
of
god
they
did
join
the
churches
of
god

and
they
were
called
the
people
of
god
and
the
lord
did
pour
out
his
spirit
upon
them
and
they
were
blessed
and
prospered
in
the
land
mosiah
chapter


now
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
of
the
rising
generation
that
could
not
understand
the
words
of
king
benjamin
being
little
children
at
the
time
he
spake
unto
his
people
and
they
did
not
believe
the
tradition
of
their
fathers

they
did
not
believe
what
had
been
said
concerning
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
neither
did
they
believe
concerning
the
coming
of
christ

and
now
because
of
their
unbelief
they
could
not
understand
the
word
of
god
and
their
hearts
were
hardened

and
they
would
not
be
baptized
neither
would
they
join
the
church
and
they
were
a
separate
people
as
to
their
faith
and
remained
so
ever
after
even
in
their
carnal
and
sinful
state
for
they
would
not
call
upon
the
lord
their
god

and
now
in
the
reign
of
mosiah
they
were
not
half
so
numerous
as
the
people
of
god
but
because
of
the
dissensions
among
the
brethren
they
became
more
numerous

for
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
deceive
many
with
their
flattering
words
who
were
in
the
church
and
did
cause
them
to
commit
many
sins
therefore
it
became
expedient
that
those
who
committed
sin
that
were
in
the
church
should
be
admonished
by
the
church

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
brought
before
the
priests
and
delivered
up
unto
the
priests
by
the
teachers
and
the
priests
brought
them
before
alma
who
was
the
high
priest

now
king
mosiah
had
given
alma
the
authority
over
the
church

and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
did
not
know
concerning
them
but
there
were
many
witnesses
against
them
yea
the
people
stood
and
testified
of
their
iniquity
in
abundance

now
there
had
not
any
such
thing
happened
before
in
the
church
therefore
alma
was
troubled
in
his
spirit
and
he
caused
that
they
should
be
brought
before
the
king

and
he
said
unto
the
king
behold
here
are
many
whom
we
have
brought
before
thee
who
are
accused
of
their
brethren
yea
and
they
have
been
taken
in
divers
iniquities
and
they
do
not
repent
of
their
iniquities
therefore
we
have
brought
them
before
thee
that
thou
mayest
judge
them
according
to
their
crimes

but
king
mosiah
said
unto
alma
behold
i
judge
them
not
therefore
i
deliver
them
into
thy
hands
to
be
judged

and
now
the
spirit
of
alma
was
again
troubled
and
he
went
and
inquired
of
the
lord
what
he
should
do
concerning
this
matter
for
he
feared
that
he
should
do
wrong
in
the
sight
of
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
he
had
poured
out
his
whole
soul
to
god
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
to
him
saying

blessed
art
thou
alma
and
blessed
are
they
who
were
baptized
in
the
waters
of
mormon
thou
art
blessed
because
of
thy
exceeding
faith
in
the
words
alone
of
my
servant
abinadi

and
blessed
are
they
because
of
their
exceeding
faith
in
the
words
alone
which
thou
hast
spoken
unto
them

and
blessed
art
thou
because
thou
hast
established
a
church
among
this
people
and
they
shall
be
established
and
they
shall
be
my
people

yea
blessed
is
this
people
who
are
willing
to
bear
my
name
for
in
my
name
shall
they
be
called
and
they
are
mine

and
because
thou
hast
inquired
of
me
concerning
the
transgressor
thou
art
blessed

thou
art
my
servant
and
i
covenant
with
thee
that
thou
shalt
have
eternal
life
and
thou
shalt
serve
me
and
go
forth
in
my
name
and
shalt
gather
together
my
sheep

and
he
that
will
hear
my
voice
shall
be
my
sheep
and
him
shall
ye
receive
into
the
church
and
him
will
i
also
receive

for
behold
this
is
my
church
whosoever
is
baptized
shall
be
baptized
unto
repentance
and
whomsoever
ye
receive
shall
believe
in
my
name
and
him
will
i
freely
forgive

for
it
is
i
that
taketh
upon
me
the
sins
of
the
world
for
it
is
i
that
hath
created
them
and
it
is
i
that
granteth
unto
him
that
believeth
unto
the
end
a
place
at
my
right
hand

for
behold
in
my
name
are
they
called
and
if
they
know
me
they
shall
come
forth
and
shall
have
a
place
eternally
at
my
right
hand

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
the
second
trump
shall
sound
then
shall
they
that
never
knew
me
come
forth
and
shall
stand
before
me

and
then
shall
they
know
that
i
am
the
lord
their
god
that
i
am
their
redeemer
but
they
would
not
be
redeemed

and
then
i
will
confess
unto
them
that
i
never
knew
them
and
they
shall
depart
into
everlasting
fire
prepared
for
the
devil
and
his
angels

therefore
i
say
unto
you
that
he
that
will
not
hear
my
voice
the
same
shall
ye
not
receive
into
my
church
for
him
i
will
not
receive
at
the
last
day

therefore
i
say
unto
you
go
and
whosoever
transgresseth
against
me
him
shall
ye
judge
according
to
the
sins
which
he
has
committed
and
if
he
confess
his
sins
before
thee
and
me
and
repenteth
in
the
sincerity
of
his
heart
him
shall
ye
forgive
and
i
will
forgive
him
also

yea
and
as
often
as
my
people
repent
will
i
forgive
them
their
trespasses
against
me

and
ye
shall
also
forgive
one
another
your
trespasses
for
verily
i
say
unto
you
he
that
forgiveth
not
his
neighbors
trespasses
when
he
says
that
he
repents
the
same
hath
brought
himself
under
condemnation

now
i
say
unto
you
go
and
whosoever
will
not
repent
of
his
sins
the
same
shall
not
be
numbered
among
my
people
and
this
shall
be
observed
from
this
time
forward

and
it
came
to
pass
when
alma
had
heard
these
words
he
wrote
them
down
that
he
might
have
them
and
that
he
might
judge
the
people
of
that
church
according
to
the
commandments
of
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
went
and
judged
those
that
had
been
taken
in
iniquity
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord

and
whosoever
repented
of
their
sins
and
did
confess
them
them
he
did
number
among
the
people
of
the
church

and
those
that
would
not
confess
their
sins
and
repent
of
their
iniquity
the
same
were
not
numbered
among
the
people
of
the
church
and
their
names
were
blotted
out

and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
did
regulate
all
the
affairs
of
the
church
and
they
began
again
to
have
peace
and
to
prosper
exceedingly
in
the
affairs
of
the
church
walking
circumspectly
before
god
receiving
many
and
baptizing
many

and
now
all
these
things
did
alma
and
his
fellow
laborers
do
who
were
over
the
church
walking
in
all
diligence
teaching
the
word
of
god
in
all
things
suffering
all
manner
of
afflictions
being
persecuted
by
all
those
who
did
not
belong
to
the
church
of
god

and
they
did
admonish
their
brethren
and
they
were
also
admonished
every
one
by
the
word
of
god
according
to
his
sins
or
to
the
sins
which
he
had
committed
being
commanded
of
god
to
pray
without
ceasing
and
to
give
thanks
in
all
things
mosiah
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
persecutions
which
were
inflicted
on
the
church
by
the
unbelievers
became
so
great
that
the
church
began
to
murmur
and
complain
to
their
leaders
concerning
the
matter
and
they
did
complain
to
alma
and
alma
laid
the
case
before
their
king
mosiah
and
mosiah
consulted
with
his
priests

and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
mosiah
sent
a
proclamation
throughout
the
land
round
about
that
there
should
not
any
unbeliever
persecute
any
of
those
who
belonged
to
the
church
of
god

and
there
was
a
strict
command
throughout
all
the
churches
that
there
should
be
no
persecutions
among
them
that
there
should
be
an
equality
among
all
men

that
they
should
let
no
pride
nor
haughtiness
disturb
their
peace
that
every
man
should
esteem
his
neighbor
as
himself
laboring
with
their
own
hands
for
their
support

yea
and
all
their
priests
and
teachers
should
labor
with
their
own
hands
for
their
support
in
all
cases
save
it
were
in
sickness
or
in
much
want
and
doing
these
things
they
did
abound
in
the
grace
of
god

and
there
began
to
be
much
peace
again
in
the
land
and
the
people
began
to
be
very
numerous
and
began
to
scatter
abroad
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
yea
on
the
north
and
on
the
south
on
the
east
and
on
the
west
building
large
cities
and
villages
in
all
quarters
of
the
land

and
the
lord
did
visit
them
and
prosper
them
and
they
became
a
large
and
wealthy
people

now
the
sons
of
mosiah
were
numbered
among
the
unbelievers
and
also
one
of
the
sons
of
alma
was
numbered
among
them
he
being
called
alma
after
his
father
nevertheless
he
became
a
very
wicked
and
an
idolatrous
man
and
he
was
a
man
of
many
words
and
did
speak
much
flattery
to
the
people
therefore
he
led
many
of
the
people
to
do
after
the
manner
of
his
iniquities

and
he
became
a
great
hinderment
to
the
prosperity
of
the
church
of
god
stealing
away
the
hearts
of
the
people
causing
much
dissension
among
the
people
giving
a
chance
for
the
enemy
of
god
to
exercise
his
power
over
them

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
while
he
was
going
about
to
destroy
the
church
of
god
for
he
did
go
about
secretly
with
the
sons
of
mosiah
seeking
to
destroy
the
church
and
to
lead
astray
the
people
of
the
lord
contrary
to
the
commandments
of
god
or
even
the
king

and
as
i
said
unto
you
as
they
were
going
about
rebelling
against
god
behold
the
angel
of
the
lord
appeared
unto
them
and
he
descended
as
it
were
in
a
cloud
and
he
spake
as
it
were
with
a
voice
of
thunder
which
caused
the
earth
to
shake
upon
which
they
stood

and
so
great
was
their
astonishment
that
they
fell
to
the
earth
and
understood
not
the
words
which
he
spake
unto
them

nevertheless
he
cried
again
saying
alma
arise
and
stand
forth
for
why
persecutest
thou
the
church
of
god
for
the
lord
hath
said
this
is
my
church
and
i
will
establish
it
and
nothing
shall
overthrow
it
save
it
is
the
transgression
of
my
people

and
again
the
angel
said
behold
the
lord
hath
heard
the
prayers
of
his
people
and
also
the
prayers
of
his
servant
alma
who
is
thy
father
for
he
has
prayed
with
much
faith
concerning
thee
that
thou
mightest
be
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
therefore
for
this
purpose
have
i
come
to
convince
thee
of
the
power
and
authority
of
god
that
the
prayers
of
his
servants
might
be
answered
according
to
their
faith

and
now
behold
can
ye
dispute
the
power
of
god
for
behold
doth
not
my
voice
shake
the
earth
and
can
ye
not
also
behold
me
before
you
and
i
am
sent
from
god

now
i
say
unto
thee
go
and
remember
the
captivity
of
thy
fathers
in
the
land
of
helam
and
in
the
land
of
nephi
and
remember
how
great
things
he
has
done
for
them
for
they
were
in
bondage
and
he
has
delivered
them
and
now
i
say
unto
thee
alma
go
thy
way
and
seek
to
destroy
the
church
no
more
that
their
prayers
may
be
answered
and
this
even
if
thou
wilt
of
thyself
be
cast
off

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
these
were
the
last
words
which
the
angel
spake
unto
alma
and
he
departed

and
now
alma
and
those
that
were
with
him
fell
again
to
the
earth
for
great
was
their
astonishment
for
with
their
own
eyes
they
had
beheld
an
angel
of
the
lord
and
his
voice
was
as
thunder
which
shook
the
earth
and
they
knew
that
there
was
nothing
save
the
power
of
god
that
could
shake
the
earth
and
cause
it
to
tremble
as
though
it
would
part
asunder

and
now
the
astonishment
of
alma
was
so
great
that
he
became
dumb
that
he
could
not
open
his
mouth
yea
and
he
became
weak
even
that
he
could
not
move
his
hands
therefore
he
was
taken
by
those
that
were
with
him
and
carried
helpless
even
until
he
was
laid
before
his
father

and
they
rehearsed
unto
his
father
all
that
had
happened
unto
them
and
his
father
rejoiced
for
he
knew
that
it
was
the
power
of
god

and
he
caused
that
a
multitude
should
be
gathered
together
that
they
might
witness
what
the
lord
had
done
for
his
son
and
also
for
those
that
were
with
him

and
he
caused
that
the
priests
should
assemble
themselves
together
and
they
began
to
fast
and
to
pray
to
the
lord
their
god
that
he
would
open
the
mouth
of
alma
that
he
might
speak
and
also
that
his
limbs
might
receive
their
strengththat
the
eyes
of
the
people
might
be
opened
to
see
and
know
of
the
goodness
and
glory
of
god

and
it
came
to
pass
after
they
had
fasted
and
prayed
for
the
space
of
two
days
and
two
nights
the
limbs
of
alma
received
their
strength
and
he
stood
up
and
began
to
speak
unto
them
bidding
them
to
be
of
good
comfort

for
said
he
i
have
repented
of
my
sins
and
have
been
redeemed
of
the
lord
behold
i
am
born
of
the
spirit

and
the
lord
said
unto
me
marvel
not
that
all
mankind
yea
men
and
women
all
nations
kindreds
tongues
and
people
must
be
born
again
yea
born
of
god
changed
from
their
carnal
and
fallen
state
to
a
state
of
righteousness
being
redeemed
of
god
becoming
his
sons
and
daughters

and
thus
they
become
new
creatures
and
unless
they
do
this
they
can
in
nowise
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god

i
say
unto
you
unless
this
be
the
case
they
must
be
cast
off
and
this
i
know
because
i
was
like
to
be
cast
off

nevertheless
after
wading
through
much
tribulations
repenting
nigh
unto
death
the
lord
in
mercy
hath
seen
fit
to
snatch
me
out
of
an
everlasting
burning
and
i
am
born
of
god

my
soul
hath
been
redeemed
from
the
gall
of
bitterness
and
bonds
of
iniquity
i
was
in
the
darkest
abyss
but
now
i
behold
the
marvelous
light
of
god
my
soul
was
racked
with
eternal
torment
but
i
am
snatched
and
my
soul
is
pained
no
more

i
rejected
my
redeemer
and
denied
that
which
had
been
spoken
of
by
our
fathers
but
now
that
they
may
foresee
that
he
will
come
and
that
he
remembereth
every
creature
of
his
creating
he
will
make
himself
manifest
unto
all

yea
every
knee
shall
bow
and
every
tongue
confess
before
him
yea
even
at
the
last
day
when
all
men
shall
stand
to
be
judged
of
him
then
shall
they
confess
that
he
is
god
then
shall
they
confess
who
live
without
god
in
the
world
that
the
judgment
of
an
everlasting
punishment
is
just
upon
them
and
they
shall
quake
and
tremble
and
shrink
beneath
the
glance
of
his
allsearching
eye

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
began
from
this
time
forward
to
teach
the
people
and
those
who
were
with
alma
at
the
time
the
angel
appeared
unto
them
traveling
round
about
through
all
the
land
publishing
to
all
the
people
the
things
which
they
had
heard
and
seen
and
preaching
the
word
of
god
in
much
tribulation
being
greatly
persecuted
by
those
who
were
unbelievers
being
smitten
by
many
of
them

but
notwithstanding
all
this
they
did
impart
much
consolation
to
the
church
confirming
their
faith
and
exhorting
them
with
longsuffering
and
much
travail
to
keep
the
commandments
of
god

and
four
of
them
were
the
sons
of
mosiah
and
their
names
were
ammon
and
aaron
and
omner
and
himni
these
were
the
names
of
the
sons
of
mosiah

and
they
traveled
throughout
all
the
lands
of
zarahemla
and
among
all
the
people
who
were
under
the
reign
of
king
mosiah
zealously
striving
to
repair
all
the
injuries
which
they
had
done
to
the
church
confessing
all
their
sins
and
publishing
all
the
things
which
they
had
seen
and
explaining
the
prophecies
and
the
scriptures
to
all
who
desired
to
hear
them

and
thus
they
were
instruments
in
the
hands
of
god
in
bringing
many
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
yea
to
the
knowledge
of
their
redeemer

and
how
blessed
are
they
for
they
did
publish
peace
they
did
publish
good
tidings
of
good
and
they
did
declare
unto
the
people
that
the
lord
reigneth
mosiah
chapter


now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
sons
of
mosiah
had
done
all
these
things
they
took
a
small
number
with
them
and
returned
to
their
father
the
king
and
desired
of
him
that
he
would
grant
unto
them
that
they
might
with
these
whom
they
had
selected
go
up
to
the
land
of
nephi
that
they
might
preach
the
things
which
they
had
heard
and
that
they
might
impart
the
word
of
god
to
their
brethren
the
lamanites

that
perhaps
they
might
bring
them
to
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
their
god
and
convince
them
of
the
iniquity
of
their
fathers
and
that
perhaps
they
might
cure
them
of
their
hatred
towards
the
nephites
that
they
might
also
be
brought
to
rejoice
in
the
lord
their
god
that
they
might
become
friendly
to
one
another
and
that
there
should
be
no
more
contentions
in
all
the
land
which
the
lord
their
god
had
given
them

now
they
were
desirous
that
salvation
should
be
declared
to
every
creature
for
they
could
not
bear
that
any
human
soul
should
perish
yea
even
the
very
thoughts
that
any
soul
should
endure
endless
torment
did
cause
them
to
quake
and
tremble

and
thus
did
the
spirit
of
the
lord
work
upon
them
for
they
were
the
very
vilest
of
sinners
and
the
lord
saw
fit
in
his
infinite
mercy
to
spare
them
nevertheless
they
suffered
much
anguish
of
soul
because
of
their
iniquities
suffering
much
and
fearing
that
they
should
be
cast
off
forever

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
plead
with
their
father
many
days
that
they
might
go
up
to
the
land
of
nephi

and
king
mosiah
went
and
inquired
of
the
lord
if
he
should
let
his
sons
go
up
among
the
lamanites
to
preach
the
word

and
the
lord
said
unto
mosiah
let
them
go
up
for
many
shall
believe
on
their
words
and
they
shall
have
eternal
life
and
i
will
deliver
thy
sons
out
of
the
hands
of
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
mosiah
granted
that
they
might
go
and
do
according
to
their
request

and
they
took
their
journey
into
the
wilderness
to
go
up
to
preach
the
word
among
the
lamanites
and
i
shall
give
an
account
of
their
proceedings
hereafter

now
king
mosiah
had
no
one
to
confer
the
kingdom
upon
for
there
was
not
any
of
his
sons
who
would
accept
of
the
kingdom

therefore
he
took
the
records
which
were
engraven
on
the
plates
of
brass
and
also
the
plates
of
nephi
and
all
the
things
which
he
had
kept
and
preserved
according
to
the
commandments
of
god
after
having
translated
and
caused
to
be
written
the
records
which
were
on
the
plates
of
gold
which
had
been
found
by
the
people
of
limhi
which
were
delivered
to
him
by
the
hand
of
limhi

and
this
he
did
because
of
the
great
anxiety
of
his
people
for
they
were
desirous
beyond
measure
to
know
concerning
those
people
who
had
been
destroyed

and
now
he
translated
them
by
the
means
of
those
two
stones
which
were
fastened
into
the
two
rims
of
a
bow

now
these
things
were
prepared
from
the
beginning
and
were
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
for
the
purpose
of
interpreting
languages

and
they
have
been
kept
and
preserved
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
that
he
should
discover
to
every
creature
who
should
possess
the
land
the
iniquities
and
abominations
of
his
people

and
whosoever
has
these
things
is
called
seer
after
the
manner
of
old
times

now
after
mosiah
had
finished
translating
these
records
behold
it
gave
an
account
of
the
people
who
were
destroyed
from
the
time
that
they
were
destroyed
back
to
the
building
of
the
great
tower
at
the
time
the
lord
confounded
the
language
of
the
people
and
they
were
scattered
abroad
upon
the
face
of
all
the
earth
yea
and
even
from
that
time
back
until
the
creation
of
adam

now
this
account
did
cause
the
people
of
mosiah
to
mourn
exceedingly
yea
they
were
filled
with
sorrow
nevertheless
it
gave
them
much
knowledge
in
the
which
they
did
rejoice

and
this
account
shall
be
written
hereafter
for
behold
it
is
expedient
that
all
people
should
know
the
things
which
are
written
in
this
account

and
now
as
i
said
unto
you
that
after
king
mosiah
had
done
these
things
he
took
the
plates
of
brass
and
all
the
things
which
he
had
kept
and
conferred
them
upon
alma
who
was
the
son
of
alma
yea
all
the
records
and
also
the
interpreters
and
conferred
them
upon
him
and
commanded
him
that
he
should
keep
and
preserve
them
and
also
keep
a
record
of
the
people
handing
them
down
from
one
generation
to
another
even
as
they
had
been
handed
down
from
the
time
that
lehi
left
jerusalem
mosiah
chapter


now
when
mosiah
had
done
this
he
sent
out
throughout
all
the
land
among
all
the
people
desiring
to
know
their
will
concerning
who
should
be
their
king

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
people
came
saying
we
are
desirous
that
aaron
thy
son
should
be
our
king
and
our
ruler

now
aaron
had
gone
up
to
the
land
of
nephi
therefore
the
king
could
not
confer
the
kingdom
upon
him
neither
would
aaron
take
upon
him
the
kingdom
neither
were
any
of
the
sons
of
mosiah
willing
to
take
upon
them
the
kingdom

therefore
king
mosiah
sent
again
among
the
people
yea
even
a
written
word
sent
he
among
the
people
and
these
were
the
words
that
were
written
saying

behold
o
ye
my
people
or
my
brethren
for
i
esteem
you
as
such
i
desire
that
ye
should
consider
the
cause
which
ye
are
called
to
considerfor
ye
are
desirous
to
have
a
king

now
i
declare
unto
you
that
he
to
whom
the
kingdom
doth
rightly
belong
has
declined
and
will
not
take
upon
him
the
kingdom

and
now
if
there
should
be
another
appointed
in
his
stead
behold
i
fear
there
would
rise
contentions
among
you
and
who
knoweth
but
what
my
son
to
whom
the
kingdom
doth
belong
should
turn
to
be
angry
and
draw
away
a
part
of
this
people
after
him
which
would
cause
wars
and
contentions
among
you
which
would
be
the
cause
of
shedding
much
blood
and
perverting
the
way
of
the
lord
yea
and
destroy
the
souls
of
many
people

now
i
say
unto
you
let
us
be
wise
and
consider
these
things
for
we
have
no
right
to
destroy
my
son
neither
should
we
have
any
right
to
destroy
another
if
he
should
be
appointed
in
his
stead

and
if
my
son
should
turn
again
to
his
pride
and
vain
things
he
would
recall
the
things
which
he
had
said
and
claim
his
right
to
the
kingdom
which
would
cause
him
and
also
this
people
to
commit
much
sin

and
now
let
us
be
wise
and
look
forward
to
these
things
and
do
that
which
will
make
for
the
peace
of
this
people

therefore
i
will
be
your
king
the
remainder
of
my
days
nevertheless
let
us
appoint
judges
to
judge
this
people
according
to
our
law
and
we
will
newly
arrange
the
affairs
of
this
people
for
we
will
appoint
wise
men
to
be
judges
that
will
judge
this
people
according
to
the
commandments
of
god

now
it
is
better
that
a
man
should
be
judged
of
god
than
of
man
for
the
judgments
of
god
are
always
just
but
the
judgments
of
man
are
not
always
just

therefore
if
it
were
possible
that
you
could
have
just
men
to
be
your
kings
who
would
establish
the
laws
of
god
and
judge
this
people
according
to
his
commandments
yea
if
ye
could
have
men
for
your
kings
who
would
do
even
as
my
father
benjamin
did
for
this
peoplei
say
unto
you
if
this
could
always
be
the
case
then
it
would
be
expedient
that
ye
should
always
have
kings
to
rule
over
you

and
even
i
myself
have
labored
with
all
the
power
and
faculties
which
i
have
possessed
to
teach
you
the
commandments
of
god
and
to
establish
peace
throughout
the
land
that
there
should
be
no
wars
nor
contentions
no
stealing
nor
plundering
nor
murdering
nor
any
manner
of
iniquity

and
whosoever
has
committed
iniquity
him
have
i
punished
according
to
the
crime
which
he
has
committed
according
to
the
law
which
has
been
given
to
us
by
our
fathers

now
i
say
unto
you
that
because
all
men
are
not
just
it
is
not
expedient
that
ye
should
have
a
king
or
kings
to
rule
over
you

for
behold
how
much
iniquity
doth
one
wicked
king
cause
to
be
committed
yea
and
what
great
destruction

yea
remember
king
noah
his
wickedness
and
his
abominations
and
also
the
wickedness
and
abominations
of
his
people
behold
what
great
destruction
did
come
upon
them
and
also
because
of
their
iniquities
they
were
brought
into
bondage

and
were
it
not
for
the
interposition
of
their
allwise
creator
and
this
because
of
their
sincere
repentance
they
must
unavoidably
remain
in
bondage
until
now

but
behold
he
did
deliver
them
because
they
did
humble
themselves
before
him
and
because
they
cried
mightily
unto
him
he
did
deliver
them
out
of
bondage
and
thus
doth
the
lord
work
with
his
power
in
all
cases
among
the
children
of
men
extending
the
arm
of
mercy
towards
them
that
put
their
trust
in
him

and
behold
now
i
say
unto
you
ye
cannot
dethrone
an
iniquitous
king
save
it
be
through
much
contention
and
the
shedding
of
much
blood

for
behold
he
has
his
friends
in
iniquity
and
he
keepeth
his
guards
about
him
and
he
teareth
up
the
laws
of
those
who
have
reigned
in
righteousness
before
him
and
he
trampleth
under
his
feet
the
commandments
of
god

and
he
enacteth
laws
and
sendeth
them
forth
among
his
people
yea
laws
after
the
manner
of
his
own
wickedness
and
whosoever
doth
not
obey
his
laws
he
causeth
to
be
destroyed
and
whosoever
doth
rebel
against
him
he
will
send
his
armies
against
them
to
war
and
if
he
can
he
will
destroy
them
and
thus
an
unrighteous
king
doth
pervert
the
ways
of
all
righteousness

and
now
behold
i
say
unto
you
it
is
not
expedient
that
such
abominations
should
come
upon
you

therefore
choose
you
by
the
voice
of
this
people
judges
that
ye
may
be
judged
according
to
the
laws
which
have
been
given
you
by
our
fathers
which
are
correct
and
which
were
given
them
by
the
hand
of
the
lord

now
it
is
not
common
that
the
voice
of
the
people
desireth
anything
contrary
to
that
which
is
right
but
it
is
common
for
the
lesser
part
of
the
people
to
desire
that
which
is
not
right
therefore
this
shall
ye
observe
and
make
it
your
lawto
do
your
business
by
the
voice
of
the
people

and
if
the
time
comes
that
the
voice
of
the
people
doth
choose
iniquity
then
is
the
time
that
the
judgments
of
god
will
come
upon
you
yea
then
is
the
time
he
will
visit
you
with
great
destruction
even
as
he
has
hitherto
visited
this
land

and
now
if
ye
have
judges
and
they
do
not
judge
you
according
to
the
law
which
has
been
given
ye
can
cause
that
they
may
be
judged
of
a
higher
judge

if
your
higher
judges
do
not
judge
righteous
judgments
ye
shall
cause
that
a
small
number
of
your
lower
judges
should
be
gathered
together
and
they
shall
judge
your
higher
judges
according
to
the
voice
of
the
people

and
i
command
you
to
do
these
things
in
the
fear
of
the
lord
and
i
command
you
to
do
these
things
and
that
ye
have
no
king
that
if
these
people
commit
sins
and
iniquities
they
shall
be
answered
upon
their
own
heads

for
behold
i
say
unto
you
the
sins
of
many
people
have
been
caused
by
the
iniquities
of
their
kings
therefore
their
iniquities
are
answered
upon
the
heads
of
their
kings

and
now
i
desire
that
this
inequality
should
be
no
more
in
this
land
especially
among
this
my
people
but
i
desire
that
this
land
be
a
land
of
liberty
and
every
man
may
enjoy
his
rights
and
privileges
alike
so
long
as
the
lord
sees
fit
that
we
may
live
and
inherit
the
land
yea
even
as
long
as
any
of
our
posterity
remains
upon
the
face
of
the
land

and
many
more
things
did
king
mosiah
write
unto
them
unfolding
unto
them
all
the
trials
and
troubles
of
a
righteous
king
yea
all
the
travails
of
soul
for
their
people
and
also
all
the
murmurings
of
the
people
to
their
king
and
he
explained
it
all
unto
them

and
he
told
them
that
these
things
ought
not
to
be
but
that
the
burden
should
come
upon
all
the
people
that
every
man
might
bear
his
part

and
he
also
unfolded
unto
them
all
the
disadvantages
they
labored
under
by
having
an
unrighteous
king
to
rule
over
them

yea
all
his
iniquities
and
abominations
and
all
the
wars
and
contentions
and
bloodshed
and
the
stealing
and
the
plundering
and
the
committing
of
whoredoms
and
all
manner
of
iniquities
which
cannot
be
enumeratedtelling
them
that
these
things
ought
not
to
be
that
they
were
expressly
repugnant
to
the
commandments
of
god

and
now
it
came
to
pass
after
king
mosiah
had
sent
these
things
forth
among
the
people
they
were
convinced
of
the
truth
of
his
words

therefore
they
relinquished
their
desires
for
a
king
and
became
exceedingly
anxious
that
every
man
should
have
an
equal
chance
throughout
all
the
land
yea
and
every
man
expressed
a
willingness
to
answer
for
his
own
sins

therefore
it
came
to
pass
that
they
assembled
themselves
together
in
bodies
throughout
the
land
to
cast
in
their
voices
concerning
who
should
be
their
judges
to
judge
them
according
to
the
law
which
had
been
given
them
and
they
were
exceedingly
rejoiced
because
of
the
liberty
which
had
been
granted
unto
them

and
they
did
wax
strong
in
love
towards
mosiah
yea
they
did
esteem
him
more
than
any
other
man
for
they
did
not
look
upon
him
as
a
tyrant
who
was
seeking
for
gain
yea
for
that
lucre
which
doth
corrupt
the
soul
for
he
had
not
exacted
riches
of
them
neither
had
he
delighted
in
the
shedding
of
blood
but
he
had
established
peace
in
the
land
and
he
had
granted
unto
his
people
that
they
should
be
delivered
from
all
manner
of
bondage
therefore
they
did
esteem
him
yea
exceedingly
beyond
measure

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
appoint
judges
to
rule
over
them
or
to
judge
them
according
to
the
law
and
this
they
did
throughout
all
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
was
appointed
to
be
the
first
chief
judge
he
being
also
the
high
priest
his
father
having
conferred
the
office
upon
him
and
having
given
him
the
charge
concerning
all
the
affairs
of
the
church

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
did
walk
in
the
ways
of
the
lord
and
he
did
keep
his
commandments
and
he
did
judge
righteous
judgments
and
there
was
continual
peace
through
the
land

and
thus
commenced
the
reign
of
the
judges
throughout
all
the
land
of
zarahemla
among
all
the
people
who
were
called
the
nephites
and
alma
was
the
first
and
chief
judge

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
his
father
died
being
eighty
and
two
years
old
having
lived
to
fulfil
the
commandments
of
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
mosiah
died
also
in
the
thirty
and
third
year
of
his
reign
being
sixty
and
three
years
old
making
in
the
whole
five
hundred
and
nine
years
from
the
time
lehi
left
jerusalem

and
thus
ended
the
reign
of
the
kings
over
the
people
of
nephi
and
thus
ended
the
days
of
alma
who
was
the
founder
of
their
church
the
book
of
alma
the
son
of
alma
the
account
of
alma
who
was
the
son
of
alma
the
first
and
chief
judge
over
the
people
of
nephi
and
also
the
high
priest
over
the
church
an
account
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
and
the
wars
and
contentions
among
the
people
and
also
an
account
of
a
war
between
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites
according
to
the
record
of
alma
the
first
and
chief
judge
alma
chapter


now
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
from
this
time
forward
king
mosiah
having
gone
the
way
of
all
the
earth
having
warred
a
good
warfare
walking
uprightly
before
god
leaving
none
to
reign
in
his
stead
nevertheless
he
had
established
laws
and
they
were
acknowledged
by
the
people
therefore
they
were
obliged
to
abide
by
the
laws
which
he
had
made

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
first
year
of
the
reign
of
alma
in
the
judgmentseat
there
was
a
man
brought
before
him
to
be
judged
a
man
who
was
large
and
was
noted
for
his
much
strength

and
he
had
gone
about
among
the
people
preaching
to
them
that
which
he
termed
to
be
the
word
of
god
bearing
down
against
the
church
declaring
unto
the
people
that
every
priest
and
teacher
ought
to
become
popular
and
they
ought
not
to
labor
with
their
hands
but
that
they
ought
to
be
supported
by
the
people

and
he
also
testified
unto
the
people
that
all
mankind
should
be
saved
at
the
last
day
and
that
they
need
not
fear
nor
tremble
but
that
they
might
lift
up
their
heads
and
rejoice
for
the
lord
had
created
all
men
and
had
also
redeemed
all
men
and
in
the
end
all
men
should
have
eternal
life

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
teach
these
things
so
much
that
many
did
believe
on
his
words
even
so
many
that
they
began
to
support
him
and
give
him
money

and
he
began
to
be
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
his
heart
and
to
wear
very
costly
apparel
yea
and
even
began
to
establish
a
church
after
the
manner
of
his
preaching

and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
going
to
preach
to
those
who
believed
on
his
word
he
met
a
man
who
belonged
to
the
church
of
god
yea
even
one
of
their
teachers
and
he
began
to
contend
with
him
sharply
that
he
might
lead
away
the
people
of
the
church
but
the
man
withstood
him
admonishing
him
with
the
words
of
god

now
the
name
of
the
man
was
gideon
and
it
was
he
who
was
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
god
in
delivering
the
people
of
limhi
out
of
bondage

now
because
gideon
withstood
him
with
the
words
of
god
he
was
wroth
with
gideon
and
drew
his
sword
and
began
to
smite
him
now
gideon
being
stricken
with
many
years
therefore
he
was
not
able
to
withstand
his
blows
therefore
he
was
slain
by
the
sword

and
the
man
who
slew
him
was
taken
by
the
people
of
the
church
and
was
brought
before
alma
to
be
judged
according
to
the
crimes
which
he
had
committed

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
stood
before
alma
and
pleaded
for
himself
with
much
boldness

but
alma
said
unto
him
behold
this
is
the
first
time
that
priestcraft
has
been
introduced
among
this
people
and
behold
thou
art
not
only
guilty
of
priestcraft
but
hast
endeavored
to
enforce
it
by
the
sword
and
were
priestcraft
to
be
enforced
among
this
people
it
would
prove
their
entire
destruction

and
thou
hast
shed
the
blood
of
a
righteous
man
yea
a
man
who
has
done
much
good
among
this
people
and
were
we
to
spare
thee
his
blood
would
come
upon
us
for
vengeance

therefore
thou
art
condemned
to
die
according
to
the
law
which
has
been
given
us
by
mosiah
our
last
king
and
it
has
been
acknowledged
by
this
people
therefore
this
people
must
abide
by
the
law

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
took
him
and
his
name
was
nehor
and
they
carried
him
upon
the
top
of
the
hill
manti
and
there
he
was
caused
or
rather
did
acknowledge
between
the
heavens
and
the
earth
that
what
he
had
taught
to
the
people
was
contrary
to
the
word
of
god
and
there
he
suffered
an
ignominious
death

nevertheless
this
did
not
put
an
end
to
the
spreading
of
priestcraft
through
the
land
for
there
were
many
who
loved
the
vain
things
of
the
world
and
they
went
forth
preaching
false
doctrines
and
this
they
did
for
the
sake
of
riches
and
honor

nevertheless
they
durst
not
lie
if
it
were
known
for
fear
of
the
law
for
liars
were
punished
therefore
they
pretended
to
preach
according
to
their
belief
and
now
the
law
could
have
no
power
on
any
man
for
his
belief

and
they
durst
not
steal
for
fear
of
the
law
for
such
were
punished
neither
durst
they
rob
nor
murder
for
he
that
murdered
was
punished
unto
death

but
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
did
not
belong
to
the
church
of
god
began
to
persecute
those
that
did
belong
to
the
church
of
god
and
had
taken
upon
them
the
name
of
christ

yea
they
did
persecute
them
and
afflict
them
with
all
manner
of
words
and
this
because
of
their
humility
because
they
were
not
proud
in
their
own
eyes
and
because
they
did
impart
the
word
of
god
one
with
another
without
money
and
without
price

now
there
was
a
strict
law
among
the
people
of
the
church
that
there
should
not
any
man
belonging
to
the
church
arise
and
persecute
those
that
did
not
belong
to
the
church
and
that
there
should
be
no
persecution
among
themselves

nevertheless
there
were
many
among
them
who
began
to
be
proud
and
began
to
contend
warmly
with
their
adversaries
even
unto
blows
yea
they
would
smite
one
another
with
their
fists

now
this
was
in
the
second
year
of
the
reign
of
alma
and
it
was
a
cause
of
much
affliction
to
the
church
yea
it
was
the
cause
of
much
trial
with
the
church

for
the
hearts
of
many
were
hardened
and
their
names
were
blotted
out
that
they
were
remembered
no
more
among
the
people
of
god
and
also
many
withdrew
themselves
from
among
them

now
this
was
a
great
trial
to
those
that
did
stand
fast
in
the
faith
nevertheless
they
were
steadfast
and
immovable
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
god
and
they
bore
with
patience
the
persecution
which
was
heaped
upon
them

and
when
the
priests
left
their
labor
to
impart
the
word
of
god
unto
the
people
the
people
also
left
their
labors
to
hear
the
word
of
god
and
when
the
priest
had
imparted
unto
them
the
word
of
god
they
all
returned
again
diligently
unto
their
labors
and
the
priest
not
esteeming
himself
above
his
hearers
for
the
preacher
was
no
better
than
the
hearer
neither
was
the
teacher
any
better
than
the
learner
and
thus
they
were
all
equal
and
they
did
all
labor
every
man
according
to
his
strength

and
they
did
impart
of
their
substance
every
man
according
to
that
which
he
had
to
the
poor
and
the
needy
and
the
sick
and
the
afflicted
and
they
did
not
wear
costly
apparel
yet
they
were
neat
and
comely

and
thus
they
did
establish
the
affairs
of
the
church
and
thus
they
began
to
have
continual
peace
again
notwithstanding
all
their
persecutions

and
now
because
of
the
steadiness
of
the
church
they
began
to
be
exceedingly
rich
having
abundance
of
all
things
whatsoever
they
stood
in
needan
abundance
of
flocks
and
herds
and
fatlings
of
every
kind
and
also
abundance
of
grain
and
of
gold
and
of
silver
and
of
precious
things
and
abundance
of
silk
and
finetwined
linen
and
all
manner
of
good
homely
cloth

and
thus
in
their
prosperous
circumstances
they
did
not
send
away
any
who
were
naked
or
that
were
hungry
or
that
were
athirst
or
that
were
sick
or
that
had
not
been
nourished
and
they
did
not
set
their
hearts
upon
riches
therefore
they
were
liberal
to
all
both
old
and
young
both
bond
and
free
both
male
and
female
whether
out
of
the
church
or
in
the
church
having
no
respect
to
persons
as
to
those
who
stood
in
need

and
thus
they
did
prosper
and
become
far
more
wealthy
than
those
who
did
not
belong
to
their
church

for
those
who
did
not
belong
to
their
church
did
indulge
themselves
in
sorceries
and
in
idolatry
or
idleness
and
in
babblings
and
in
envyings
and
strife
wearing
costly
apparel
being
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
own
eyes
persecuting
lying
thieving
robbing
committing
whoredoms
and
murdering
and
all
manner
of
wickedness
nevertheless
the
law
was
put
in
force
upon
all
those
who
did
transgress
it
inasmuch
as
it
was
possible

and
it
came
to
pass
that
by
thus
exercising
the
law
upon
them
every
man
suffering
according
to
that
which
he
had
done
they
became
more
still
and
durst
not
commit
any
wickedness
if
it
were
known
therefore
there
was
much
peace
among
the
people
of
nephi
until
the
fifth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
alma
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
fifth
year
of
their
reign
there
began
to
be
a
contention
among
the
people
for
a
certain
man
being
called
amlici
he
being
a
very
cunning
man
yea
a
wise
man
as
to
the
wisdom
of
the
world
he
being
after
the
order
of
the
man
that
slew
gideon
by
the
sword
who
was
executed
according
to
the
law

now
this
amlici
had
by
his
cunning
drawn
away
much
people
after
him
even
so
much
that
they
began
to
be
very
powerful
and
they
began
to
endeavor
to
establish
amlici
to
be
king
over
the
people

now
this
was
alarming
to
the
people
of
the
church
and
also
to
all
those
who
had
not
been
drawn
away
after
the
persuasions
of
amlici
for
they
knew
that
according
to
their
law
that
such
things
must
be
established
by
the
voice
of
the
people

therefore
if
it
were
possible
that
amlici
should
gain
the
voice
of
the
people
he
being
a
wicked
man
would
deprive
them
of
their
rights
and
privileges
of
the
church
for
it
was
his
intent
to
destroy
the
church
of
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
assembled
themselves
together
throughout
all
the
land
every
man
according
to
his
mind
whether
it
were
for
or
against
amlici
in
separate
bodies
having
much
dispute
and
wonderful
contentions
one
with
another

and
thus
they
did
assemble
themselves
together
to
cast
in
their
voices
concerning
the
matter
and
they
were
laid
before
the
judges

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
people
came
against
amlici
that
he
was
not
made
king
over
the
people

now
this
did
cause
much
joy
in
the
hearts
of
those
who
were
against
him
but
amlici
did
stir
up
those
who
were
in
his
favor
to
anger
against
those
who
were
not
in
his
favor

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
gathered
themselves
together
and
did
consecrate
amlici
to
be
their
king

now
when
amlici
was
made
king
over
them
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
take
up
arms
against
their
brethren
and
this
he
did
that
he
might
subject
them
to
him

now
the
people
of
amlici
were
distinguished
by
the
name
of
amlici
being
called
amlicites
and
the
remainder
were
called
nephites
or
the
people
of
god

therefore
the
people
of
the
nephites
were
aware
of
the
intent
of
the
amlicites
and
therefore
they
did
prepare
to
meet
them
yea
they
did
arm
themselves
with
swords
and
with
cimeters
and
with
bows
and
with
arrows
and
with
stones
and
with
slings
and
with
all
manner
of
weapons
of
war
of
every
kind

and
thus
they
were
prepared
to
meet
the
amlicites
at
the
time
of
their
coming
and
there
were
appointed
captains
and
higher
captains
and
chief
captains
according
to
their
numbers

and
it
came
to
pass
that
amlici
did
arm
his
men
with
all
manner
of
weapons
of
war
of
every
kind
and
he
also
appointed
rulers
and
leaders
over
his
people
to
lead
them
to
war
against
their
brethren

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
amlicites
came
upon
the
hill
amnihu
which
was
east
of
the
river
sidon
which
ran
by
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
there
they
began
to
make
war
with
the
nephites

now
alma
being
the
chief
judge
and
the
governor
of
the
people
of
nephi
therefore
he
went
up
with
his
people
yea
with
his
captains
and
chief
captains
yea
at
the
head
of
his
armies
against
the
amlicites
to
battle

and
they
began
to
slay
the
amlicites
upon
the
hill
east
of
sidon
and
the
amlicites
did
contend
with
the
nephites
with
great
strength
insomuch
that
many
of
the
nephites
did
fall
before
the
amlicites

nevertheless
the
lord
did
strengthen
the
hand
of
the
nephites
that
they
slew
the
amlicites
with
great
slaughter
that
they
began
to
flee
before
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
nephites
did
pursue
the
amlicites
all
that
day
and
did
slay
them
with
much
slaughter
insomuch
that
there
were
slain
of
the
amlicites
twelve
thousand
five
hundred
thirty
and
two
souls
and
there
were
slain
of
the
nephites
six
thousand
five
hundred
sixty
and
two
souls

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
alma
could
pursue
the
amlicites
no
longer
he
caused
that
his
people
should
pitch
their
tents
in
the
valley
of
gideon
the
valley
being
called
after
that
gideon
who
was
slain
by
the
hand
of
nehor
with
the
sword
and
in
this
valley
the
nephites
did
pitch
their
tents
for
the
night

and
alma
sent
spies
to
follow
the
remnant
of
the
amlicites
that
he
might
know
of
their
plans
and
their
plots
whereby
he
might
guard
himself
against
them
that
he
might
preserve
his
people
from
being
destroyed

now
those
whom
he
had
sent
out
to
watch
the
camp
of
the
amlicites
were
called
zeram
and
amnor
and
manti
and
limher
these
were
they
who
went
out
with
their
men
to
watch
the
camp
of
the
amlicites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
they
returned
into
the
camp
of
the
nephites
in
great
haste
being
greatly
astonished
and
struck
with
much
fear
saying

behold
we
followed
the
camp
of
the
amlicites
and
to
our
great
astonishment
in
the
land
of
minon
above
the
land
of
zarahemla
in
the
course
of
the
land
of
nephi
we
saw
a
numerous
host
of
the
lamanites
and
behold
the
amlicites
have
joined
them

and
they
are
upon
our
brethren
in
that
land
and
they
are
fleeing
before
them
with
their
flocks
and
their
wives
and
their
children
towards
our
city
and
except
we
make
haste
they
obtain
possession
of
our
city
and
our
fathers
and
our
wives
and
our
children
be
slain

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
nephi
took
their
tents
and
departed
out
of
the
valley
of
gideon
towards
their
city
which
was
the
city
of
zarahemla

and
behold
as
they
were
crossing
the
river
sidon
the
lamanites
and
the
amlicites
being
as
numerous
almost
as
it
were
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
came
upon
them
to
destroy
them

nevertheless
the
nephites
being
strengthened
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
having
prayed
mightily
to
him
that
he
would
deliver
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
therefore
the
lord
did
hear
their
cries
and
did
strengthen
them
and
the
lamanites
and
the
amlicites
did
fall
before
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
fought
with
amlici
with
the
sword
face
to
face
and
they
did
contend
mightily
one
with
another

and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
being
a
man
of
god
being
exercised
with
much
faith
cried
saying
o
lord
have
mercy
and
spare
my
life
that
i
may
be
an
instrument
in
thy
hands
to
save
and
preserve
this
people

now
when
alma
had
said
these
words
he
contended
again
with
amlici
and
he
was
strengthened
insomuch
that
he
slew
amlici
with
the
sword

and
he
also
contended
with
the
king
of
the
lamanites
but
the
king
of
the
lamanites
fled
back
from
before
alma
and
sent
his
guards
to
contend
with
alma

but
alma
with
his
guards
contended
with
the
guards
of
the
king
of
the
lamanites
until
he
slew
and
drove
them
back

and
thus
he
cleared
the
ground
or
rather
the
bank
which
was
on
the
west
of
the
river
sidon
throwing
the
bodies
of
the
lamanites
who
had
been
slain
into
the
waters
of
sidon
that
thereby
his
people
might
have
room
to
cross
and
contend
with
the
lamanites
and
the
amlicites
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
sidon

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
all
crossed
the
river
sidon
that
the
lamanites
and
the
amlicites
began
to
flee
before
them
notwithstanding
they
were
so
numerous
that
they
could
not
be
numbered

and
they
fled
before
the
nephites
towards
the
wilderness
which
was
west
and
north
away
beyond
the
borders
of
the
land
and
the
nephites
did
pursue
them
with
their
might
and
did
slay
them

yea
they
were
met
on
every
hand
and
slain
and
driven
until
they
were
scattered
on
the
west
and
on
the
north
until
they
had
reached
the
wilderness
which
was
called
hermounts
and
it
was
that
part
of
the
wilderness
which
was
infested
by
wild
and
ravenous
beasts

and
it
came
to
pass
that
many
died
in
the
wilderness
of
their
wounds
and
were
devoured
by
those
beasts
and
also
the
vultures
of
the
air
and
their
bones
have
been
found
and
have
been
heaped
up
on
the
earth
alma
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
nephites
who
were
not
slain
by
the
weapons
of
war
after
having
buried
those
who
had
been
slainnow
the
number
of
the
slain
were
not
numbered
because
of
the
greatness
of
their
numberafter
they
had
finished
burying
their
dead
they
all
returned
to
their
lands
and
to
their
houses
and
their
wives
and
their
children

now
many
women
and
children
had
been
slain
with
the
sword
and
also
many
of
their
flocks
and
their
herds
and
also
many
of
their
fields
of
grain
were
destroyed
for
they
were
trodden
down
by
the
hosts
of
men

and
now
as
many
of
the
lamanites
and
the
amlicites
who
had
been
slain
upon
the
bank
of
the
river
sidon
were
cast
into
the
waters
of
sidon
and
behold
their
bones
are
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
they
are
many

and
the
amlicites
were
distinguished
from
the
nephites
for
they
had
marked
themselves
with
red
in
their
foreheads
after
the
manner
of
the
lamanites
nevertheless
they
had
not
shorn
their
heads
like
unto
the
lamanites

now
the
heads
of
the
lamanites
were
shorn
and
they
were
naked
save
it
were
skin
which
was
girded
about
their
loins
and
also
their
armor
which
was
girded
about
them
and
their
bows
and
their
arrows
and
their
stones
and
their
slings
and
so
forth

and
the
skins
of
the
lamanites
were
dark
according
to
the
mark
which
was
set
upon
their
fathers
which
was
a
curse
upon
them
because
of
their
transgression
and
their
rebellion
against
their
brethren
who
consisted
of
nephi
jacob
and
joseph
and
sam
who
were
just
and
holy
men

and
their
brethren
sought
to
destroy
them
therefore
they
were
cursed
and
the
lord
god
set
a
mark
upon
them
yea
upon
laman
and
lemuel
and
also
the
sons
of
ishmael
and
ishmaelitish
women

and
this
was
done
that
their
seed
might
be
distinguished
from
the
seed
of
their
brethren
that
thereby
the
lord
god
might
preserve
his
people
that
they
might
not
mix
and
believe
in
incorrect
traditions
which
would
prove
their
destruction

and
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
did
mingle
his
seed
with
that
of
the
lamanites
did
bring
the
same
curse
upon
his
seed

therefore
whosoever
suffered
himself
to
be
led
away
by
the
lamanites
was
called
under
that
head
and
there
was
a
mark
set
upon
him

and
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
would
not
believe
in
the
tradition
of
the
lamanites
but
believed
those
records
which
were
brought
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
also
in
the
tradition
of
their
fathers
which
were
correct
who
believed
in
the
commandments
of
god
and
kept
them
were
called
the
nephites
or
the
people
of
nephi
from
that
time
forth

and
it
is
they
who
have
kept
the
records
which
are
true
of
their
people
and
also
of
the
people
of
the
lamanites

now
we
will
return
again
to
the
amlicites
for
they
also
had
a
mark
set
upon
them
yea
they
set
the
mark
upon
themselves
yea
even
a
mark
of
red
upon
their
foreheads

thus
the
word
of
god
is
fulfilled
for
these
are
the
words
which
he
said
to
nephi
behold
the
lamanites
have
i
cursed
and
i
will
set
a
mark
on
them
that
they
and
their
seed
may
be
separated
from
thee
and
thy
seed
from
this
time
henceforth
and
forever
except
they
repent
of
their
wickedness
and
turn
to
me
that
i
may
have
mercy
upon
them

and
again
i
will
set
a
mark
upon
him
that
mingleth
his
seed
with
thy
brethren
that
they
may
be
cursed
also

and
again
i
will
set
a
mark
upon
him
that
fighteth
against
thee
and
thy
seed

and
again
i
say
he
that
departeth
from
thee
shall
no
more
be
called
thy
seed
and
i
will
bless
thee
and
whomsoever
shall
be
called
thy
seed
henceforth
and
forever
and
these
were
the
promises
of
the
lord
unto
nephi
and
to
his
seed

now
the
amlicites
knew
not
that
they
were
fulfilling
the
words
of
god
when
they
began
to
mark
themselves
in
their
foreheads
nevertheless
they
had
come
out
in
open
rebellion
against
god
therefore
it
was
expedient
that
the
curse
should
fall
upon
them

now
i
would
that
ye
should
see
that
they
brought
upon
themselves
the
curse
and
even
so
doth
every
man
that
is
cursed
bring
upon
himself
his
own
condemnation

now
it
came
to
pass
that
not
many
days
after
the
battle
which
was
fought
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
by
the
lamanites
and
the
amlicites
that
there
was
another
army
of
the
lamanites
came
in
upon
the
people
of
nephi
in
the
same
place
where
the
first
army
met
the
amlicites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
an
army
sent
to
drive
them
out
of
their
land

now
alma
himself
being
afflicted
with
a
wound
did
not
go
up
to
battle
at
this
time
against
the
lamanites

but
he
sent
up
a
numerous
army
against
them
and
they
went
up
and
slew
many
of
the
lamanites
and
drove
the
remainder
of
them
out
of
the
borders
of
their
land

and
then
they
returned
again
and
began
to
establish
peace
in
the
land
being
troubled
no
more
for
a
time
with
their
enemies

now
all
these
things
were
done
yea
all
these
wars
and
contentions
were
commenced
and
ended
in
the
fifth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges

and
in
one
year
were
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
of
souls
sent
to
the
eternal
world
that
they
might
reap
their
rewards
according
to
their
works
whether
they
were
good
or
whether
they
were
bad
to
reap
eternal
happiness
or
eternal
misery
according
to
the
spirit
which
they
listed
to
obey
whether
it
be
a
good
spirit
or
a
bad
one

for
every
man
receiveth
wages
of
him
whom
he
listeth
to
obey
and
this
according
to
the
words
of
the
spirit
of
prophecy
therefore
let
it
be
according
to
the
truth
and
thus
endeth
the
fifth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
alma
chapter


now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
there
were
no
contentions
nor
wars
in
the
land
of
zarahemla

but
the
people
were
afflicted
yea
greatly
afflicted
for
the
loss
of
their
brethren
and
also
for
the
loss
of
their
flocks
and
herds
and
also
for
the
loss
of
their
fields
of
grain
which
were
trodden
under
foot
and
destroyed
by
the
lamanites

and
so
great
were
their
afflictions
that
every
soul
had
cause
to
mourn
and
they
believed
that
it
was
the
judgments
of
god
sent
upon
them
because
of
their
wickedness
and
their
abominations
therefore
they
were
awakened
to
a
remembrance
of
their
duty

and
they
began
to
establish
the
church
more
fully
yea
and
many
were
baptized
in
the
waters
of
sidon
and
were
joined
to
the
church
of
god
yea
they
were
baptized
by
the
hand
of
alma
who
had
been
consecrated
the
high
priest
over
the
people
of
the
church
by
the
hand
of
his
father
alma

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
seventh
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
there
were
about
three
thousand
five
hundred
souls
that
united
themselves
to
the
church
of
god
and
were
baptized
and
thus
endeth
the
seventh
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
and
there
was
continual
peace
in
all
that
time

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
that
the
people
of
the
church
began
to
wax
proud
because
of
their
exceeding
riches
and
their
fine
silks
and
their
finetwined
linen
and
because
of
their
many
flocks
and
herds
and
their
gold
and
their
silver
and
all
manner
of
precious
things
which
they
had
obtained
by
their
industry
and
in
all
these
things
were
they
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
eyes
for
they
began
to
wear
very
costly
apparel

now
this
was
the
cause
of
much
affliction
to
alma
yea
and
to
many
of
the
people
whom
alma
had
consecrated
to
be
teachers
and
priests
and
elders
over
the
church
yea
many
of
them
were
sorely
grieved
for
the
wickedness
which
they
saw
had
begun
to
be
among
their
people

for
they
saw
and
beheld
with
great
sorrow
that
the
people
of
the
church
began
to
be
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
eyes
and
to
set
their
hearts
upon
riches
and
upon
the
vain
things
of
the
world
that
they
began
to
be
scornful
one
towards
another
and
they
began
to
persecute
those
that
did
not
believe
according
to
their
own
will
and
pleasure

and
thus
in
this
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
there
began
to
be
great
contentions
among
the
people
of
the
church
yea
there
were
envyings
and
strife
and
malice
and
persecutions
and
pride
even
to
exceed
the
pride
of
those
who
did
not
belong
to
the
church
of
god

and
thus
ended
the
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
and
the
wickedness
of
the
church
was
a
great
stumblingblock
to
those
who
did
not
belong
to
the
church
and
thus
the
church
began
to
fail
in
its
progress

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
ninth
year
alma
saw
the
wickedness
of
the
church
and
he
saw
also
that
the
example
of
the
church
began
to
lead
those
who
were
unbelievers
on
from
one
piece
of
iniquity
to
another
thus
bringing
on
the
destruction
of
the
people

yea
he
saw
great
inequality
among
the
people
some
lifting
themselves
up
with
their
pride
despising
others
turning
their
backs
upon
the
needy
and
the
naked
and
those
who
were
hungry
and
those
who
were
athirst
and
those
who
were
sick
and
afflicted

now
this
was
a
great
cause
for
lamentations
among
the
people
while
others
were
abasing
themselves
succoring
those
who
stood
in
need
of
their
succor
such
as
imparting
their
substance
to
the
poor
and
the
needy
feeding
the
hungry
and
suffering
all
manner
of
afflictions
for
christs
sake
who
should
come
according
to
the
spirit
of
prophecy

looking
forward
to
that
day
thus
retaining
a
remission
of
their
sins
being
filled
with
great
joy
because
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
according
to
the
will
and
power
and
deliverance
of
jesus
christ
from
the
bands
of
death

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
having
seen
the
afflictions
of
the
humble
followers
of
god
and
the
persecutions
which
were
heaped
upon
them
by
the
remainder
of
his
people
and
seeing
all
their
inequality
began
to
be
very
sorrowful
nevertheless
the
spirit
of
the
lord
did
not
fail
him

and
he
selected
a
wise
man
who
was
among
the
elders
of
the
church
and
gave
him
power
according
to
the
voice
of
the
people
that
he
might
have
power
to
enact
laws
according
to
the
laws
which
had
been
given
and
to
put
them
in
force
according
to
the
wickedness
and
the
crimes
of
the
people

now
this
mans
name
was
nephihah
and
he
was
appointed
chief
judge
and
he
sat
in
the
judgmentseat
to
judge
and
to
govern
the
people

now
alma
did
not
grant
unto
him
the
office
of
being
high
priest
over
the
church
but
he
retained
the
office
of
high
priest
unto
himself
but
he
delivered
the
judgmentseat
unto
nephihah

and
this
he
did
that
he
himself
might
go
forth
among
his
people
or
among
the
people
of
nephi
that
he
might
preach
the
word
of
god
unto
them
to
stir
them
up
in
remembrance
of
their
duty
and
that
he
might
pull
down
by
the
word
of
god
all
the
pride
and
craftiness
and
all
the
contentions
which
were
among
his
people
seeing
no
way
that
he
might
reclaim
them
save
it
were
in
bearing
down
in
pure
testimony
against
them

and
thus
in
the
commencement
of
the
ninth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
alma
delivered
up
the
judgmentseat
to
nephihah
and
confined
himself
wholly
to
the
high
priesthood
of
the
holy
order
of
god
to
the
testimony
of
the
word
according
to
the
spirit
of
revelation
and
prophecy
alma
chapter


now
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
began
to
deliver
the
word
of
god
unto
the
people
first
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
from
thence
throughout
all
the
land

and
these
are
the
words
which
he
spake
to
the
people
in
the
church
which
was
established
in
the
city
of
zarahemla
according
to
his
own
record
saying

i
alma
having
been
consecrated
by
my
father
alma
to
be
a
high
priest
over
the
church
of
god
he
having
power
and
authority
from
god
to
do
these
things
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
he
began
to
establish
a
church
in
the
land
which
was
in
the
borders
of
nephi
yea
the
land
which
was
called
the
land
of
mormon
yea
and
he
did
baptize
his
brethren
in
the
waters
of
mormon

and
behold
i
say
unto
you
they
were
delivered
out
of
the
hands
of
the
people
of
king
noah
by
the
mercy
and
power
of
god

and
behold
after
that
they
were
brought
into
bondage
by
the
hands
of
the
lamanites
in
the
wilderness
yea
i
say
unto
you
they
were
in
captivity
and
again
the
lord
did
deliver
them
out
of
bondage
by
the
power
of
his
word
and
we
were
brought
into
this
land
and
here
we
began
to
establish
the
church
of
god
throughout
this
land
also

and
now
behold
i
say
unto
you
my
brethren
you
that
belong
to
this
church
have
you
sufficiently
retained
in
remembrance
the
captivity
of
your
fathers
yea
and
have
you
sufficiently
retained
in
remembrance
his
mercy
and
longsuffering
towards
them
and
moreover
have
ye
sufficiently
retained
in
remembrance
that
he
has
delivered
their
souls
from
hell

behold
he
changed
their
hearts
yea
he
awakened
them
out
of
a
deep
sleep
and
they
awoke
unto
god
behold
they
were
in
the
midst
of
darkness
nevertheless
their
souls
were
illuminated
by
the
light
of
the
everlasting
word
yea
they
were
encircled
about
by
the
bands
of
death
and
the
chains
of
hell
and
an
everlasting
destruction
did
await
them

and
now
i
ask
of
you
my
brethren
were
they
destroyed
behold
i
say
unto
you
nay
they
were
not

and
again
i
ask
were
the
bands
of
death
broken
and
the
chains
of
hell
which
encircled
them
about
were
they
loosed
i
say
unto
you
yea
they
were
loosed
and
their
souls
did
expand
and
they
did
sing
redeeming
love
and
i
say
unto
you
that
they
are
saved

and
now
i
ask
of
you
on
what
conditions
are
they
saved
yea
what
grounds
had
they
to
hope
for
salvation
what
is
the
cause
of
their
being
loosed
from
the
bands
of
death
yea
and
also
the
chains
of
hell

behold
i
can
tell
youdid
not
my
father
alma
believe
in
the
words
which
were
delivered
by
the
mouth
of
abinadi
and
was
he
not
a
holy
prophet
did
he
not
speak
the
words
of
god
and
my
father
alma
believe
them

and
according
to
his
faith
there
was
a
mighty
change
wrought
in
his
heart
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
this
is
all
true

and
behold
he
preached
the
word
unto
your
fathers
and
a
mighty
change
was
also
wrought
in
their
hearts
and
they
humbled
themselves
and
put
their
trust
in
the
true
and
living
god
and
behold
they
were
faithful
until
the
end
therefore
they
were
saved

and
now
behold
i
ask
of
you
my
brethren
of
the
church
have
ye
spiritually
been
born
of
god
have
ye
received
his
image
in
your
countenances
have
ye
experienced
this
mighty
change
in
your
hearts

do
ye
exercise
faith
in
the
redemption
of
him
who
created
you
do
you
look
forward
with
an
eye
of
faith
and
view
this
mortal
body
raised
in
immortality
and
this
corruption
raised
in
incorruption
to
stand
before
god
to
be
judged
according
to
the
deeds
which
have
been
done
in
the
mortal
body

i
say
unto
you
can
you
imagine
to
yourselves
that
ye
hear
the
voice
of
the
lord
saying
unto
you
in
that
day
come
unto
me
ye
blessed
for
behold
your
works
have
been
the
works
of
righteousness
upon
the
face
of
the
earth

or
do
ye
imagine
to
yourselves
that
ye
can
lie
unto
the
lord
in
that
day
and
saylord
our
works
have
been
righteous
works
upon
the
face
of
the
earthand
that
he
will
save
you

or
otherwise
can
ye
imagine
yourselves
brought
before
the
tribunal
of
god
with
your
souls
filled
with
guilt
and
remorse
having
a
remembrance
of
all
your
guilt
yea
a
perfect
remembrance
of
all
your
wickedness
yea
a
remembrance
that
ye
have
set
at
defiance
the
commandments
of
god

i
say
unto
you
can
ye
look
up
to
god
at
that
day
with
a
pure
heart
and
clean
hands
i
say
unto
you
can
you
look
up
having
the
image
of
god
engraven
upon
your
countenances

i
say
unto
you
can
ye
think
of
being
saved
when
you
have
yielded
yourselves
to
become
subjects
to
the
devil

i
say
unto
you
ye
will
know
at
that
day
that
ye
cannot
be
saved
for
there
can
no
man
be
saved
except
his
garments
are
washed
white
yea
his
garments
must
be
purified
until
they
are
cleansed
from
all
stain
through
the
blood
of
him
of
whom
it
has
been
spoken
by
our
fathers
who
should
come
to
redeem
his
people
from
their
sins

and
now
i
ask
of
you
my
brethren
how
will
any
of
you
feel
if
ye
shall
stand
before
the
bar
of
god
having
your
garments
stained
with
blood
and
all
manner
of
filthiness
behold
what
will
these
things
testify
against
you

behold
will
they
not
testify
that
ye
are
murderers
yea
and
also
that
ye
are
guilty
of
all
manner
of
wickedness

behold
my
brethren
do
ye
suppose
that
such
an
one
can
have
a
place
to
sit
down
in
the
kingdom
of
god
with
abraham
with
isaac
and
with
jacob
and
also
all
the
holy
prophets
whose
garments
are
cleansed
and
are
spotless
pure
and
white

i
say
unto
you
nay
except
ye
make
our
creator
a
liar
from
the
beginning
or
suppose
that
he
is
a
liar
from
the
beginning
ye
cannot
suppose
that
such
can
have
place
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
they
shall
be
cast
out
for
they
are
the
children
of
the
kingdom
of
the
devil

and
now
behold
i
say
unto
you
my
brethren
if
ye
have
experienced
a
change
of
heart
and
if
ye
have
felt
to
sing
the
song
of
redeeming
love
i
would
ask
can
ye
feel
so
now

have
ye
walked
keeping
yourselves
blameless
before
god
could
ye
say
if
ye
were
called
to
die
at
this
time
within
yourselves
that
ye
have
been
sufficiently
humble
that
your
garments
have
been
cleansed
and
made
white
through
the
blood
of
christ
who
will
come
to
redeem
his
people
from
their
sins

behold
are
ye
stripped
of
pride
i
say
unto
you
if
ye
are
not
ye
are
not
prepared
to
meet
god
behold
ye
must
prepare
quickly
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
soon
at
hand
and
such
an
one
hath
not
eternal
life

behold
i
say
is
there
one
among
you
who
is
not
stripped
of
envy
i
say
unto
you
that
such
an
one
is
not
prepared
and
i
would
that
he
should
prepare
quickly
for
the
hour
is
close
at
hand
and
he
knoweth
not
when
the
time
shall
come
for
such
an
one
is
not
found
guiltless

and
again
i
say
unto
you
is
there
one
among
you
that
doth
make
a
mock
of
his
brother
or
that
heapeth
upon
him
persecutions

wo
unto
such
an
one
for
he
is
not
prepared
and
the
time
is
at
hand
that
he
must
repent
or
he
cannot
be
saved

yea
even
wo
unto
all
ye
workers
of
iniquity
repent
repent
for
the
lord
god
hath
spoken
it

behold
he
sendeth
an
invitation
unto
all
men
for
the
arms
of
mercy
are
extended
towards
them
and
he
saith
repent
and
i
will
receive
you

yea
he
saith
come
unto
me
and
ye
shall
partake
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
life
yea
ye
shall
eat
and
drink
of
the
bread
and
the
waters
of
life
freely

yea
come
unto
me
and
bring
forth
works
of
righteousness
and
ye
shall
not
be
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire

for
behold
the
time
is
at
hand
that
whosoever
bringeth
forth
not
good
fruit
or
whosoever
doeth
not
the
works
of
righteousness
the
same
have
cause
to
wail
and
mourn

o
ye
workers
of
iniquity
ye
that
are
puffed
up
in
the
vain
things
of
the
world
ye
that
have
professed
to
have
known
the
ways
of
righteousness
nevertheless
have
gone
astray
as
sheep
having
no
shepherd
notwithstanding
a
shepherd
hath
called
after
you
and
is
still
calling
after
you
but
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
his
voice

behold
i
say
unto
you
that
the
good
shepherd
doth
call
you
yea
and
in
his
own
name
he
doth
call
you
which
is
the
name
of
christ
and
if
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
good
shepherd
to
the
name
by
which
ye
are
called
behold
ye
are
not
the
sheep
of
the
good
shepherd

and
now
if
ye
are
not
the
sheep
of
the
good
shepherd
of
what
fold
are
ye
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
the
devil
is
your
shepherd
and
ye
are
of
his
fold
and
now
who
can
deny
this
behold
i
say
unto
you
whosoever
denieth
this
is
a
liar
and
a
child
of
the
devil

for
i
say
unto
you
that
whatsoever
is
good
cometh
from
god
and
whatsoever
is
evil
cometh
from
the
devil

therefore
if
a
man
bringeth
forth
good
works
he
hearkeneth
unto
the
voice
of
the
good
shepherd
and
he
doth
follow
him
but
whosoever
bringeth
forth
evil
works
the
same
becometh
a
child
of
the
devil
for
he
hearkeneth
unto
his
voice
and
doth
follow
him

and
whosoever
doeth
this
must
receive
his
wages
of
him
therefore
for
his
wages
he
receiveth
death
as
to
things
pertaining
unto
righteousness
being
dead
unto
all
good
works

and
now
my
brethren
i
would
that
ye
should
hear
me
for
i
speak
in
the
energy
of
my
soul
for
behold
i
have
spoken
unto
you
plainly
that
ye
cannot
err
or
have
spoken
according
to
the
commandments
of
god

for
i
am
called
to
speak
after
this
manner
according
to
the
holy
order
of
god
which
is
in
christ
jesus
yea
i
am
commanded
to
stand
and
testify
unto
this
people
the
things
which
have
been
spoken
by
our
fathers
concerning
the
things
which
are
to
come

and
this
is
not
all
do
ye
not
suppose
that
i
know
of
these
things
myself
behold
i
testify
unto
you
that
i
do
know
that
these
things
whereof
i
have
spoken
are
true
and
how
do
ye
suppose
that
i
know
of
their
surety

behold
i
say
unto
you
they
are
made
known
unto
me
by
the
holy
spirit
of
god
behold
i
have
fasted
and
prayed
many
days
that
i
might
know
these
things
of
myself
and
now
i
do
know
of
myself
that
they
are
true
for
the
lord
god
hath
made
them
manifest
unto
me
by
his
holy
spirit
and
this
is
the
spirit
of
revelation
which
is
in
me

and
moreover
i
say
unto
you
that
it
has
thus
been
revealed
unto
me
that
the
words
which
have
been
spoken
by
our
fathers
are
true
even
so
according
to
the
spirit
of
prophecy
which
is
in
me
which
is
also
by
the
manifestation
of
the
spirit
of
god

i
say
unto
you
that
i
know
of
myself
that
whatsoever
i
shall
say
unto
you
concerning
that
which
is
to
come
is
true
and
i
say
unto
you
that
i
know
that
jesus
christ
shall
come
yea
the
son
the
only
begotten
of
the
father
full
of
grace
and
mercy
and
truth
and
behold
it
is
he
that
cometh
to
take
away
the
sins
of
the
world
yea
the
sins
of
every
man
who
steadfastly
believeth
on
his
name

and
now
i
say
unto
you
that
this
is
the
order
after
which
i
am
called
yea
to
preach
unto
my
beloved
brethren
yea
and
every
one
that
dwelleth
in
the
land
yea
to
preach
unto
all
both
old
and
young
both
bond
and
free
yea
i
say
unto
you
the
aged
and
also
the
middle
aged
and
the
rising
generation
yea
to
cry
unto
them
that
they
must
repent
and
be
born
again

yea
thus
saith
the
spirit
repent
all
ye
ends
of
the
earth
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
soon
at
hand
yea
the
son
of
god
cometh
in
his
glory
in
his
might
majesty
power
and
dominion
yea
my
beloved
brethren
i
say
unto
you
that
the
spirit
saith
behold
the
glory
of
the
king
of
all
the
earth
and
also
the
king
of
heaven
shall
very
soon
shine
forth
among
all
the
children
of
men

and
also
the
spirit
saith
unto
me
yea
crieth
unto
me
with
a
mighty
voice
saying
go
forth
and
say
unto
this
peoplerepent
for
except
ye
repent
ye
can
in
nowise
inherit
the
kingdom
of
heaven

and
again
i
say
unto
you
the
spirit
saith
behold
the
ax
is
laid
at
the
root
of
the
tree
therefore
every
tree
that
bringeth
not
forth
good
fruit
shall
be
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
yea
a
fire
which
cannot
be
consumed
even
an
unquenchable
fire
behold
and
remember
the
holy
one
hath
spoken
it

and
now
my
beloved
brethren
i
say
unto
you
can
ye
withstand
these
sayings
yea
can
ye
lay
aside
these
things
and
trample
the
holy
one
under
your
feet
yea
can
ye
be
puffed
up
in
the
pride
of
your
hearts
yea
will
ye
still
persist
in
the
wearing
of
costly
apparel
and
setting
your
hearts
upon
the
vain
things
of
the
world
upon
your
riches

yea
will
ye
persist
in
supposing
that
ye
are
better
one
than
another
yea
will
ye
persist
in
the
persecution
of
your
brethren
who
humble
themselves
and
do
walk
after
the
holy
order
of
god
wherewith
they
have
been
brought
into
this
church
having
been
sanctified
by
the
holy
spirit
and
they
do
bring
forth
works
which
are
meet
for
repentance

yea
and
will
you
persist
in
turning
your
backs
upon
the
poor
and
the
needy
and
in
withholding
your
substance
from
them

and
finally
all
ye
that
will
persist
in
your
wickedness
i
say
unto
you
that
these
are
they
who
shall
be
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
except
they
speedily
repent

and
now
i
say
unto
you
all
you
that
are
desirous
to
follow
the
voice
of
the
good
shepherd
come
ye
out
from
the
wicked
and
be
ye
separate
and
touch
not
their
unclean
things
and
behold
their
names
shall
be
blotted
out
that
the
names
of
the
wicked
shall
not
be
numbered
among
the
names
of
the
righteous
that
the
word
of
god
may
be
fulfilled
which
saith
the
names
of
the
wicked
shall
not
be
mingled
with
the
names
of
my
people

for
the
names
of
the
righteous
shall
be
written
in
the
book
of
life
and
unto
them
will
i
grant
an
inheritance
at
my
right
hand
and
now
my
brethren
what
have
ye
to
say
against
this
i
say
unto
you
if
ye
speak
against
it
it
matters
not
for
the
word
of
god
must
be
fulfilled

for
what
shepherd
is
there
among
you
having
many
sheep
doth
not
watch
over
them
that
the
wolves
enter
not
and
devour
his
flock
and
behold
if
a
wolf
enter
his
flock
doth
he
not
drive
him
out
yea
and
at
the
last
if
he
can
he
will
destroy
him

and
now
i
say
unto
you
that
the
good
shepherd
doth
call
after
you
and
if
you
will
hearken
unto
his
voice
he
will
bring
you
into
his
fold
and
ye
are
his
sheep
and
he
commandeth
you
that
ye
suffer
no
ravenous
wolf
to
enter
among
you
that
ye
may
not
be
destroyed

and
now
i
alma
do
command
you
in
the
language
of
him
who
hath
commanded
me
that
ye
observe
to
do
the
words
which
i
have
spoken
unto
you

i
speak
by
way
of
command
unto
you
that
belong
to
the
church
and
unto
those
who
do
not
belong
to
the
church
i
speak
by
way
of
invitation
saying
come
and
be
baptized
unto
repentance
that
ye
also
may
be
partakers
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
life
alma
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
alma
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
the
people
of
the
church
which
was
established
in
the
city
of
zarahemla
he
ordained
priests
and
elders
by
laying
on
his
hands
according
to
the
order
of
god
to
preside
and
watch
over
the
church

and
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
did
not
belong
to
the
church
who
repented
of
their
sins
were
baptized
unto
repentance
and
were
received
into
the
church

and
it
also
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
did
belong
to
the
church
that
did
not
repent
of
their
wickedness
and
humble
themselves
before
godi
mean
those
who
were
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
heartsthe
same
were
rejected
and
their
names
were
blotted
out
that
their
names
were
not
numbered
among
those
of
the
righteous

and
thus
they
began
to
establish
the
order
of
the
church
in
the
city
of
zarahemla

now
i
would
that
ye
should
understand
that
the
word
of
god
was
liberal
unto
all
that
none
were
deprived
of
the
privilege
of
assembling
themselves
together
to
hear
the
word
of
god

nevertheless
the
children
of
god
were
commanded
that
they
should
gather
themselves
together
oft
and
join
in
fasting
and
mighty
prayer
in
behalf
of
the
welfare
of
the
souls
of
those
who
knew
not
god

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
alma
had
made
these
regulations
he
departed
from
them
yea
from
the
church
which
was
in
the
city
of
zarahemla
and
went
over
upon
the
east
of
the
river
sidon
into
the
valley
of
gideon
there
having
been
a
city
built
which
was
called
the
city
of
gideon
which
was
in
the
valley
that
was
called
gideon
being
called
after
the
man
who
was
slain
by
the
hand
of
nehor
with
the
sword

and
alma
went
and
began
to
declare
the
word
of
god
unto
the
church
which
was
established
in
the
valley
of
gideon
according
to
the
revelation
of
the
truth
of
the
word
which
had
been
spoken
by
his
fathers
and
according
to
the
spirit
of
prophecy
which
was
in
him
according
to
the
testimony
of
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
who
should
come
to
redeem
his
people
from
their
sins
and
the
holy
order
by
which
he
was
called
and
thus
it
is
written
amen
alma
chapter


behold
my
beloved
brethren
seeing
that
i
have
been
permitted
to
come
unto
you
therefore
i
attempt
to
address
you
in
my
language
yea
by
my
own
mouth
seeing
that
it
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
spoken
unto
you
by
the
words
of
my
mouth
i
having
been
wholly
confined
to
the
judgmentseat
having
had
much
business
that
i
could
not
come
unto
you

and
even
i
could
not
have
come
now
at
this
time
were
it
not
that
the
judgmentseat
hath
been
given
to
another
to
reign
in
my
stead
and
the
lord
in
much
mercy
hath
granted
that
i
should
come
unto
you

and
behold
i
have
come
having
great
hopes
and
much
desire
that
i
should
find
that
ye
had
humbled
yourselves
before
god
and
that
ye
had
continued
in
the
supplicating
of
his
grace
that
i
should
find
that
ye
were
blameless
before
him
that
i
should
find
that
ye
were
not
in
the
awful
dilemma
that
our
brethren
were
in
at
zarahemla

but
blessed
be
the
name
of
god
that
he
hath
given
me
to
know
yea
hath
given
unto
me
the
exceedingly
great
joy
of
knowing
that
they
are
established
again
in
the
way
of
his
righteousness

and
i
trust
according
to
the
spirit
of
god
which
is
in
me
that
i
shall
also
have
joy
over
you
nevertheless
i
do
not
desire
that
my
joy
over
you
should
come
by
the
cause
of
so
much
afflictions
and
sorrow
which
i
have
had
for
the
brethren
at
zarahemla
for
behold
my
joy
cometh
over
them
after
wading
through
much
affliction
and
sorrow

but
behold
i
trust
that
ye
are
not
in
a
state
of
so
much
unbelief
as
were
your
brethren
i
trust
that
ye
are
not
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
your
hearts
yea
i
trust
that
ye
have
not
set
your
hearts
upon
riches
and
the
vain
things
of
the
world
yea
i
trust
that
you
do
not
worship
idols
but
that
ye
do
worship
the
true
and
living
god
and
that
ye
look
forward
for
the
remission
of
your
sins
with
an
everlasting
faith
which
is
to
come

for
behold
i
say
unto
you
there
be
many
things
to
come
and
behold
there
is
one
thing
which
is
of
more
importance
than
they
allfor
behold
the
time
is
not
far
distant
that
the
redeemer
liveth
and
cometh
among
his
people

behold
i
do
not
say
that
he
will
come
among
us
at
the
time
of
his
dwelling
in
his
mortal
tabernacle
for
behold
the
spirit
hath
not
said
unto
me
that
this
should
be
the
case
now
as
to
this
thing
i
do
not
know
but
this
much
i
do
know
that
the
lord
god
hath
power
to
do
all
things
which
are
according
to
his
word

but
behold
the
spirit
hath
said
this
much
unto
me
saying
cry
unto
this
people
sayingrepent
ye
and
prepare
the
way
of
the
lord
and
walk
in
his
paths
which
are
straight
for
behold
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
and
the
son
of
god
cometh
upon
the
face
of
the
earth

and
behold
he
shall
be
born
of
mary
at
jerusalem
which
is
the
land
of
our
forefathers
she
being
a
virgin
a
precious
and
chosen
vessel
who
shall
be
overshadowed
and
conceive
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
and
bring
forth
a
son
yea
even
the
son
of
god

and
he
shall
go
forth
suffering
pains
and
afflictions
and
temptations
of
every
kind
and
this
that
the
word
might
be
fulfilled
which
saith
he
will
take
upon
him
the
pains
and
the
sicknesses
of
his
people

and
he
will
take
upon
him
death
that
he
may
loose
the
bands
of
death
which
bind
his
people
and
he
will
take
upon
him
their
infirmities
that
his
bowels
may
be
filled
with
mercy
according
to
the
flesh
that
he
may
know
according
to
the
flesh
how
to
succor
his
people
according
to
their
infirmities

now
the
spirit
knoweth
all
things
nevertheless
the
son
of
god
suffereth
according
to
the
flesh
that
he
might
take
upon
him
the
sins
of
his
people
that
he
might
blot
out
their
transgressions
according
to
the
power
of
his
deliverance
and
now
behold
this
is
the
testimony
which
is
in
me

now
i
say
unto
you
that
ye
must
repent
and
be
born
again
for
the
spirit
saith
if
ye
are
not
born
again
ye
cannot
inherit
the
kingdom
of
heaven
therefore
come
and
be
baptized
unto
repentance
that
ye
may
be
washed
from
your
sins
that
ye
may
have
faith
on
the
lamb
of
god
who
taketh
away
the
sins
of
the
world
who
is
mighty
to
save
and
to
cleanse
from
all
unrighteousness

yea
i
say
unto
you
come
and
fear
not
and
lay
aside
every
sin
which
easily
doth
beset
you
which
doth
bind
you
down
to
destruction
yea
come
and
go
forth
and
show
unto
your
god
that
ye
are
willing
to
repent
of
your
sins
and
enter
into
a
covenant
with
him
to
keep
his
commandments
and
witness
it
unto
him
this
day
by
going
into
the
waters
of
baptism

and
whosoever
doeth
this
and
keepeth
the
commandments
of
god
from
thenceforth
the
same
will
remember
that
i
say
unto
him
yea
he
will
remember
that
i
have
said
unto
him
he
shall
have
eternal
life
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
holy
spirit
which
testifieth
in
me

and
now
my
beloved
brethren
do
you
believe
these
things
behold
i
say
unto
you
yea
i
know
that
ye
believe
them
and
the
way
that
i
know
that
ye
believe
them
is
by
the
manifestation
of
the
spirit
which
is
in
me
and
now
because
your
faith
is
strong
concerning
that
yea
concerning
the
things
which
i
have
spoken
great
is
my
joy

for
as
i
said
unto
you
from
the
beginning
that
i
had
much
desire
that
ye
were
not
in
the
state
of
dilemma
like
your
brethren
even
so
i
have
found
that
my
desires
have
been
gratified

for
i
perceive
that
ye
are
in
the
paths
of
righteousness
i
perceive
that
ye
are
in
the
path
which
leads
to
the
kingdom
of
god
yea
i
perceive
that
ye
are
making
his
paths
straight

i
perceive
that
it
has
been
made
known
unto
you
by
the
testimony
of
his
word
that
he
cannot
walk
in
crooked
paths
neither
doth
he
vary
from
that
which
he
hath
said
neither
hath
he
a
shadow
of
turning
from
the
right
to
the
left
or
from
that
which
is
right
to
that
which
is
wrong
therefore
his
course
is
one
eternal
round

and
he
doth
not
dwell
in
unholy
temples
neither
can
filthiness
or
anything
which
is
unclean
be
received
into
the
kingdom
of
god
therefore
i
say
unto
you
the
time
shall
come
yea
and
it
shall
be
at
the
last
day
that
he
who
is
filthy
shall
remain
in
his
filthiness

and
now
my
beloved
brethren
i
have
said
these
things
unto
you
that
i
might
awaken
you
to
a
sense
of
your
duty
to
god
that
ye
may
walk
blameless
before
him
that
ye
may
walk
after
the
holy
order
of
god
after
which
ye
have
been
received

and
now
i
would
that
ye
should
be
humble
and
be
submissive
and
gentle
easy
to
be
entreated
full
of
patience
and
longsuffering
being
temperate
in
all
things
being
diligent
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
god
at
all
times
asking
for
whatsoever
things
ye
stand
in
need
both
spiritual
and
temporal
always
returning
thanks
unto
god
for
whatsoever
things
ye
do
receive

and
see
that
ye
have
faith
hope
and
charity
and
then
ye
will
always
abound
in
good
works

and
may
the
lord
bless
you
and
keep
your
garments
spotless
that
ye
may
at
last
be
brought
to
sit
down
with
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
and
the
holy
prophets
who
have
been
ever
since
the
world
began
having
your
garments
spotless
even
as
their
garments
are
spotless
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
to
go
no
more
out

and
now
my
beloved
brethren
i
have
spoken
these
words
unto
you
according
to
the
spirit
which
testifieth
in
me
and
my
soul
doth
exceedingly
rejoice
because
of
the
exceeding
diligence
and
heed
which
ye
have
given
unto
my
word

and
now
may
the
peace
of
god
rest
upon
you
and
upon
your
houses
and
lands
and
upon
your
flocks
and
herds
and
all
that
you
possess
your
women
and
your
children
according
to
your
faith
and
good
works
from
this
time
forth
and
forever
and
thus
i
have
spoken
amen
alma
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
returned
from
the
land
of
gideon
after
having
taught
the
people
of
gideon
many
things
which
cannot
be
written
having
established
the
order
of
the
church
according
as
he
had
before
done
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
yea
he
returned
to
his
own
house
at
zarahemla
to
rest
himself
from
the
labors
which
he
had
performed

and
thus
ended
the
ninth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
tenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
that
alma
departed
from
thence
and
took
his
journey
over
into
the
land
of
melek
on
the
west
of
the
river
sidon
on
the
west
by
the
borders
of
the
wilderness

and
he
began
to
teach
the
people
in
the
land
of
melek
according
to
the
holy
order
of
god
by
which
he
had
been
called
and
he
began
to
teach
the
people
throughout
all
the
land
of
melek

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
came
to
him
throughout
all
the
borders
of
the
land
which
was
by
the
wilderness
side
and
they
were
baptized
throughout
all
the
land

so
that
when
he
had
finished
his
work
at
melek
he
departed
thence
and
traveled
three
days
journey
on
the
north
of
the
land
of
melek
and
he
came
to
a
city
which
was
called
ammonihah

now
it
was
the
custom
of
the
people
of
nephi
to
call
their
lands
and
their
cities
and
their
villages
yea
even
all
their
small
villages
after
the
name
of
him
who
first
possessed
them
and
thus
it
was
with
the
land
of
ammonihah

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
alma
had
come
to
the
city
of
ammonihah
he
began
to
preach
the
word
of
god
unto
them

now
satan
had
gotten
great
hold
upon
the
hearts
of
the
people
of
the
city
of
ammonihah
therefore
they
would
not
hearken
unto
the
words
of
alma

nevertheless
alma
labored
much
in
the
spirit
wrestling
with
god
in
mighty
prayer
that
he
would
pour
out
his
spirit
upon
the
people
who
were
in
the
city
that
he
would
also
grant
that
he
might
baptize
them
unto
repentance

nevertheless
they
hardened
their
hearts
saying
unto
him
behold
we
know
that
thou
art
alma
and
we
know
that
thou
art
high
priest
over
the
church
which
thou
hast
established
in
many
parts
of
the
land
according
to
your
tradition
and
we
are
not
of
thy
church
and
we
do
not
believe
in
such
foolish
traditions

and
now
we
know
that
because
we
are
not
of
thy
church
we
know
that
thou
hast
no
power
over
us
and
thou
hast
delivered
up
the
judgmentseat
unto
nephihah
therefore
thou
art
not
the
chief
judge
over
us

now
when
the
people
had
said
this
and
withstood
all
his
words
and
reviled
him
and
spit
upon
him
and
caused
that
he
should
be
cast
out
of
their
city
he
departed
thence
and
took
his
journey
towards
the
city
which
was
called
aaron

and
it
came
to
pass
that
while
he
was
journeying
thither
being
weighed
down
with
sorrow
wading
through
much
tribulation
and
anguish
of
soul
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
people
who
were
in
the
city
of
ammonihah
it
came
to
pass
while
alma
was
thus
weighed
down
with
sorrow
behold
an
angel
of
the
lord
appeared
unto
him
saying

blessed
art
thou
alma
therefore
lift
up
thy
head
and
rejoice
for
thou
hast
great
cause
to
rejoice
for
thou
hast
been
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
god
from
the
time
which
thou
receivedst
thy
first
message
from
him
behold
i
am
he
that
delivered
it
unto
you

and
behold
i
am
sent
to
command
thee
that
thou
return
to
the
city
of
ammonihah
and
preach
again
unto
the
people
of
the
city
yea
preach
unto
them
yea
say
unto
them
except
they
repent
the
lord
god
will
destroy
them

for
behold
they
do
study
at
this
time
that
they
may
destroy
the
liberty
of
thy
people
for
thus
saith
the
lord
which
is
contrary
to
the
statutes
and
judgments
and
commandments
which
he
has
given
unto
his
people

now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
alma
had
received
his
message
from
the
angel
of
the
lord
he
returned
speedily
to
the
land
of
ammonihah
and
he
entered
the
city
by
another
way
yea
by
the
way
which
is
on
the
south
of
the
city
of
ammonihah

and
as
he
entered
the
city
he
was
an
hungered
and
he
said
to
a
man
will
ye
give
to
an
humble
servant
of
god
something
to
eat

and
the
man
said
unto
him
i
am
a
nephite
and
i
know
that
thou
art
a
holy
prophet
of
god
for
thou
art
the
man
whom
an
angel
said
in
a
vision
thou
shalt
receive
therefore
go
with
me
into
my
house
and
i
will
impart
unto
thee
of
my
food
and
i
know
that
thou
wilt
be
a
blessing
unto
me
and
my
house

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
man
received
him
into
his
house
and
the
man
was
called
amulek
and
he
brought
forth
bread
and
meat
and
set
before
alma

and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
ate
bread
and
was
filled
and
he
blessed
amulek
and
his
house
and
he
gave
thanks
unto
god

and
after
he
had
eaten
and
was
filled
he
said
unto
amulek
i
am
alma
and
am
the
high
priest
over
the
church
of
god
throughout
the
land

and
behold
i
have
been
called
to
preach
the
word
of
god
among
all
this
people
according
to
the
spirit
of
revelation
and
prophecy
and
i
was
in
this
land
and
they
would
not
receive
me
but
they
cast
me
out
and
i
was
about
to
set
my
back
towards
this
land
forever

but
behold
i
have
been
commanded
that
i
should
turn
again
and
prophesy
unto
this
people
yea
and
to
testify
against
them
concerning
their
iniquities

and
now
amulek
because
thou
hast
fed
me
and
taken
me
in
thou
art
blessed
for
i
was
an
hungered
for
i
had
fasted
many
days

and
alma
tarried
many
days
with
amulek
before
he
began
to
preach
unto
the
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
did
wax
more
gross
in
their
iniquities

and
the
word
came
to
alma
saying
go
and
also
say
unto
my
servant
amulek
go
forth
and
prophesy
unto
this
people
sayingrepent
ye
for
thus
saith
the
lord
except
ye
repent
i
will
visit
this
people
in
mine
anger
yea
and
i
will
not
turn
my
fierce
anger
away

and
alma
went
forth
and
also
amulek
among
the
people
to
declare
the
words
of
god
unto
them
and
they
were
filled
with
the
holy
ghost

and
they
had
power
given
unto
them
insomuch
that
they
could
not
be
confined
in
dungeons
neither
was
it
possible
that
any
man
could
slay
them
nevertheless
they
did
not
exercise
their
power
until
they
were
bound
in
bands
and
cast
into
prison
now
this
was
done
that
the
lord
might
show
forth
his
power
in
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
forth
and
began
to
preach
and
to
prophesy
unto
the
people
according
to
the
spirit
and
power
which
the
lord
had
given
them
alma
chapter


and
again
i
alma
having
been
commanded
of
god
that
i
should
take
amulek
and
go
forth
and
preach
again
unto
this
people
or
the
people
who
were
in
the
city
of
ammonihah
it
came
to
pass
as
i
began
to
preach
unto
them
they
began
to
contend
with
me
saying

who
art
thou
suppose
ye
that
we
shall
believe
the
testimony
of
one
man
although
he
should
preach
unto
us
that
the
earth
should
pass
away

now
they
understood
not
the
words
which
they
spake
for
they
knew
not
that
the
earth
should
pass
away

and
they
said
also
we
will
not
believe
thy
words
if
thou
shouldst
prophesy
that
this
great
city
should
be
destroyed
in
one
day

now
they
knew
not
that
god
could
do
such
marvelous
works
for
they
were
a
hardhearted
and
a
stiffnecked
people

and
they
said
who
is
god
that
sendeth
no
more
authority
than
one
man
among
this
people
to
declare
unto
them
the
truth
of
such
great
and
marvelous
things

and
they
stood
forth
to
lay
their
hands
on
me
but
behold
they
did
not
and
i
stood
with
boldness
to
declare
unto
them
yea
i
did
boldly
testify
unto
them
saying

behold
o
ye
wicked
and
perverse
generation
how
have
ye
forgotten
the
tradition
of
your
fathers
yea
how
soon
ye
have
forgotten
the
commandments
of
god

do
ye
not
remember
that
our
father
lehi
was
brought
out
of
jerusalem
by
the
hand
of
god
do
ye
not
remember
that
they
were
all
led
by
him
through
the
wilderness

and
have
ye
forgotten
so
soon
how
many
times
he
delivered
our
fathers
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
and
preserved
them
from
being
destroyed
even
by
the
hands
of
their
own
brethren

yea
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
matchless
power
and
his
mercy
and
his
longsuffering
towards
us
we
should
unavoidably
have
been
cut
off
from
the
face
of
the
earth
long
before
this
period
of
time
and
perhaps
been
consigned
to
a
state
of
endless
misery
and
woe

behold
now
i
say
unto
you
that
he
commandeth
you
to
repent
and
except
ye
repent
ye
can
in
nowise
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
but
behold
this
is
not
allhe
has
commanded
you
to
repent
or
he
will
utterly
destroy
you
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
yea
he
will
visit
you
in
his
anger
and
in
his
fierce
anger
he
will
not
turn
away

behold
do
ye
not
remember
the
words
which
he
spake
unto
lehi
saying
that
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
land
and
again
it
is
said
that
inasmuch
as
ye
will
not
keep
my
commandments
ye
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord

now
i
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
inasmuch
as
the
lamanites
have
not
kept
the
commandments
of
god
they
have
been
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
now
we
see
that
the
word
of
the
lord
has
been
verified
in
this
thing
and
the
lamanites
have
been
cut
off
from
his
presence
from
the
beginning
of
their
transgressions
in
the
land

nevertheless
i
say
unto
you
that
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
them
in
the
day
of
judgment
than
for
you
if
ye
remain
in
your
sins
yea
and
even
more
tolerable
for
them
in
this
life
than
for
you
except
ye
repent

for
there
are
many
promises
which
are
extended
to
the
lamanites
for
it
is
because
of
the
traditions
of
their
fathers
that
caused
them
to
remain
in
their
state
of
ignorance
therefore
the
lord
will
be
merciful
unto
them
and
prolong
their
existence
in
the
land

and
at
some
period
of
time
they
will
be
brought
to
believe
in
his
word
and
to
know
of
the
incorrectness
of
the
traditions
of
their
fathers
and
many
of
them
will
be
saved
for
the
lord
will
be
merciful
unto
all
who
call
on
his
name

but
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
if
ye
persist
in
your
wickedness
that
your
days
shall
not
be
prolonged
in
the
land
for
the
lamanites
shall
be
sent
upon
you
and
if
ye
repent
not
they
shall
come
in
a
time
when
you
know
not
and
ye
shall
be
visited
with
utter
destruction
and
it
shall
be
according
to
the
fierce
anger
of
the
lord

for
he
will
not
suffer
you
that
ye
shall
live
in
your
iniquities
to
destroy
his
people
i
say
unto
you
nay
he
would
rather
suffer
that
the
lamanites
might
destroy
all
his
people
who
are
called
the
people
of
nephi
if
it
were
possible
that
they
could
fall
into
sins
and
transgressions
after
having
had
so
much
light
and
so
much
knowledge
given
unto
them
of
the
lord
their
god

yea
after
having
been
such
a
highly
favored
people
of
the
lord
yea
after
having
been
favored
above
every
other
nation
kindred
tongue
or
people
after
having
had
all
things
made
known
unto
them
according
to
their
desires
and
their
faith
and
prayers
of
that
which
has
been
and
which
is
and
which
is
to
come

having
been
visited
by
the
spirit
of
god
having
conversed
with
angels
and
having
been
spoken
unto
by
the
voice
of
the
lord
and
having
the
spirit
of
prophecy
and
the
spirit
of
revelation
and
also
many
gifts
the
gift
of
speaking
with
tongues
and
the
gift
of
preaching
and
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
and
the
gift
of
translation

yea
and
after
having
been
delivered
of
god
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
having
been
saved
from
famine
and
from
sickness
and
all
manner
of
diseases
of
every
kind
and
they
having
waxed
strong
in
battle
that
they
might
not
be
destroyed
having
been
brought
out
of
bondage
time
after
time
and
having
been
kept
and
preserved
until
now
and
they
have
been
prospered
until
they
are
rich
in
all
manner
of
things

and
now
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
if
this
people
who
have
received
so
many
blessings
from
the
hand
of
the
lord
should
transgress
contrary
to
the
light
and
knowledge
which
they
do
have
i
say
unto
you
that
if
this
be
the
case
that
if
they
should
fall
into
transgression
it
would
be
far
more
tolerable
for
the
lamanites
than
for
them

for
behold
the
promises
of
the
lord
are
extended
to
the
lamanites
but
they
are
not
unto
you
if
ye
transgress
for
has
not
the
lord
expressly
promised
and
firmly
decreed
that
if
ye
will
rebel
against
him
that
ye
shall
utterly
be
destroyed
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth

and
now
for
this
cause
that
ye
may
not
be
destroyed
the
lord
has
sent
his
angel
to
visit
many
of
his
people
declaring
unto
them
that
they
must
go
forth
and
cry
mightily
unto
this
people
saying
repent
ye
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
nigh
at
hand

and
not
many
days
hence
the
son
of
god
shall
come
in
his
glory
and
his
glory
shall
be
the
glory
of
the
only
begotten
of
the
father
full
of
grace
equity
and
truth
full
of
patience
mercy
and
longsuffering
quick
to
hear
the
cries
of
his
people
and
to
answer
their
prayers

and
behold
he
cometh
to
redeem
those
who
will
be
baptized
unto
repentance
through
faith
on
his
name

therefore
prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
lord
for
the
time
is
at
hand
that
all
men
shall
reap
a
reward
of
their
works
according
to
that
which
they
have
beenif
they
have
been
righteous
they
shall
reap
the
salvation
of
their
souls
according
to
the
power
and
deliverance
of
jesus
christ
and
if
they
have
been
evil
they
shall
reap
the
damnation
of
their
souls
according
to
the
power
and
captivation
of
the
devil

now
behold
this
is
the
voice
of
the
angel
crying
unto
the
people

and
now
my
beloved
brethren
for
ye
are
my
brethren
and
ye
ought
to
be
beloved
and
ye
ought
to
bring
forth
works
which
are
meet
for
repentance
seeing
that
your
hearts
have
been
grossly
hardened
against
the
word
of
god
and
seeing
that
ye
are
a
lost
and
a
fallen
people

now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
i
alma
had
spoken
these
words
behold
the
people
were
wroth
with
me
because
i
said
unto
them
that
they
were
a
hardhearted
and
a
stiffnecked
people

and
also
because
i
said
unto
them
that
they
were
a
lost
and
a
fallen
people
they
were
angry
with
me
and
sought
to
lay
their
hands
upon
me
that
they
might
cast
me
into
prison

but
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
did
not
suffer
them
that
they
should
take
me
at
that
time
and
cast
me
into
prison

and
it
came
to
pass
that
amulek
went
and
stood
forth
and
began
to
preach
unto
them
also
and
now
the
words
of
amulek
are
not
all
written
nevertheless
a
part
of
his
words
are
written
in
this
book
alma
chapter


now
these
are
the
words
which
amulek
preached
unto
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
of
ammonihah
saying

i
am
amulek
i
am
the
son
of
giddonah
who
was
the
son
of
ishmael
who
was
a
descendant
of
aminadi
and
it
was
the
same
aminadi
who
interpreted
the
writing
which
was
upon
the
wall
of
the
temple
which
was
written
by
the
finger
of
god

and
aminadi
was
a
descendant
of
nephi
who
was
the
son
of
lehi
who
came
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
who
was
a
descendant
of
manasseh
who
was
the
son
of
joseph
who
was
sold
into
egypt
by
the
hands
of
his
brethren

and
behold
i
am
also
a
man
of
no
small
reputation
among
all
those
who
know
me
yea
and
behold
i
have
many
kindreds
and
friends
and
i
have
also
acquired
much
riches
by
the
hand
of
my
industry

nevertheless
after
all
this
i
never
have
known
much
of
the
ways
of
the
lord
and
his
mysteries
and
marvelous
power
i
said
i
never
had
known
much
of
these
things
but
behold
i
mistake
for
i
have
seen
much
of
his
mysteries
and
his
marvelous
power
yea
even
in
the
preservation
of
the
lives
of
this
people

nevertheless
i
did
harden
my
heart
for
i
was
called
many
times
and
i
would
not
hear
therefore
i
knew
concerning
these
things
yet
i
would
not
know
therefore
i
went
on
rebelling
against
god
in
the
wickedness
of
my
heart
even
until
the
fourth
day
of
this
seventh
month
which
is
in
the
tenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges

as
i
was
journeying
to
see
a
very
near
kindred
behold
an
angel
of
the
lord
appeared
unto
me
and
said
amulek
return
to
thine
own
house
for
thou
shalt
feed
a
prophet
of
the
lord
yea
a
holy
man
who
is
a
chosen
man
of
god
for
he
has
fasted
many
days
because
of
the
sins
of
this
people
and
he
is
an
hungered
and
thou
shalt
receive
him
into
thy
house
and
feed
him
and
he
shall
bless
thee
and
thy
house
and
the
blessing
of
the
lord
shall
rest
upon
thee
and
thy
house

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
angel
and
returned
towards
my
house
and
as
i
was
going
thither
i
found
the
man
whom
the
angel
said
unto
me
thou
shalt
receive
into
thy
houseand
behold
it
was
this
same
man
who
has
been
speaking
unto
you
concerning
the
things
of
god

and
the
angel
said
unto
me
he
is
a
holy
man
wherefore
i
know
he
is
a
holy
man
because
it
was
said
by
an
angel
of
god

and
again
i
know
that
the
things
whereof
he
hath
testified
are
true
for
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
as
the
lord
liveth
even
so
has
he
sent
his
angel
to
make
these
things
manifest
unto
me
and
this
he
has
done
while
this
alma
hath
dwelt
at
my
house

for
behold
he
hath
blessed
mine
house
he
hath
blessed
me
and
my
women
and
my
children
and
my
father
and
my
kinsfolk
yea
even
all
my
kindred
hath
he
blessed
and
the
blessing
of
the
lord
hath
rested
upon
us
according
to
the
words
which
he
spake

and
now
when
amulek
had
spoken
these
words
the
people
began
to
be
astonished
seeing
there
was
more
than
one
witness
who
testified
of
the
things
whereof
they
were
accused
and
also
of
the
things
which
were
to
come
according
to
the
spirit
of
prophecy
which
was
in
them

nevertheless
there
were
some
among
them
who
thought
to
question
them
that
by
their
cunning
devices
they
might
catch
them
in
their
words
that
they
might
find
witness
against
them
that
they
might
deliver
them
to
their
judges
that
they
might
be
judged
according
to
the
law
and
that
they
might
be
slain
or
cast
into
prison
according
to
the
crime
which
they
could
make
appear
or
witness
against
them

now
it
was
those
men
who
sought
to
destroy
them
who
were
lawyers
who
were
hired
or
appointed
by
the
people
to
administer
the
law
at
their
times
of
trials
or
at
the
trials
of
the
crimes
of
the
people
before
the
judges

now
these
lawyers
were
learned
in
all
the
arts
and
cunning
of
the
people
and
this
was
to
enable
them
that
they
might
be
skilful
in
their
profession

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
began
to
question
amulek
that
thereby
they
might
make
him
cross
his
words
or
contradict
the
words
which
he
should
speak

now
they
knew
not
that
amulek
could
know
of
their
designs
but
it
came
to
pass
as
they
began
to
question
him
he
perceived
their
thoughts
and
he
said
unto
them
o
ye
wicked
and
perverse
generation
ye
lawyers
and
hypocrites
for
ye
are
laying
the
foundation
of
the
devil
for
ye
are
laying
traps
and
snares
to
catch
the
holy
ones
of
god

ye
are
laying
plans
to
pervert
the
ways
of
the
righteous
and
to
bring
down
the
wrath
of
god
upon
your
heads
even
to
the
utter
destruction
of
this
people

yea
well
did
mosiah
say
who
was
our
last
king
when
he
was
about
to
deliver
up
the
kingdom
having
no
one
to
confer
it
upon
causing
that
this
people
should
be
governed
by
their
own
voicesyea
well
did
he
say
that
if
the
time
should
come
that
the
voice
of
this
people
should
choose
iniquity
that
is
if
the
time
should
come
that
this
people
should
fall
into
transgression
they
would
be
ripe
for
destruction

and
now
i
say
unto
you
that
well
doth
the
lord
judge
of
your
iniquities
well
doth
he
cry
unto
this
people
by
the
voice
of
his
angels
repent
ye
repent
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand

yea
well
doth
he
cry
by
the
voice
of
his
angels
that
i
will
come
down
among
my
people
with
equity
and
justice
in
my
hands

yea
and
i
say
unto
you
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
prayers
of
the
righteous
who
are
now
in
the
land
that
ye
would
even
now
be
visited
with
utter
destruction
yet
it
would
not
be
by
flood
as
were
the
people
in
the
days
of
noah
but
it
would
be
by
famine
and
by
pestilence
and
the
sword

but
it
is
by
the
prayers
of
the
righteous
that
ye
are
spared
now
therefore
if
ye
will
cast
out
the
righteous
from
among
you
then
will
not
the
lord
stay
his
hand
but
in
his
fierce
anger
he
will
come
out
against
you
then
ye
shall
be
smitten
by
famine
and
by
pestilence
and
by
the
sword
and
the
time
is
soon
at
hand
except
ye
repent

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
were
more
angry
with
amulek
and
they
cried
out
saying
this
man
doth
revile
against
our
laws
which
are
just
and
our
wise
lawyers
whom
we
have
selected

but
amulek
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
cried
the
mightier
unto
them
saying
o
ye
wicked
and
perverse
generation
why
hath
satan
got
such
great
hold
upon
your
hearts
why
will
ye
yield
yourselves
unto
him
that
he
may
have
power
over
you
to
blind
your
eyes
that
ye
will
not
understand
the
words
which
are
spoken
according
to
their
truth

for
behold
have
i
testified
against
your
law
ye
do
not
understand
ye
say
that
i
have
spoken
against
your
law
but
i
have
not
but
i
have
spoken
in
favor
of
your
law
to
your
condemnation

and
now
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
the
foundation
of
the
destruction
of
this
people
is
beginning
to
be
laid
by
the
unrighteousness
of
your
lawyers
and
your
judges

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
amulek
had
spoken
these
words
the
people
cried
out
against
him
saying
now
we
know
that
this
man
is
a
child
of
the
devil
for
he
hath
lied
unto
us
for
he
hath
spoken
against
our
law
and
now
he
says
that
he
has
not
spoken
against
it

and
again
he
has
reviled
against
our
lawyers
and
our
judges

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lawyers
put
it
into
their
hearts
that
they
should
remember
these
things
against
him

and
there
was
one
among
them
whose
name
was
zeezrom
now
he
was
the
foremost
to
accuse
amulek
and
alma
he
being
one
of
the
most
expert
among
them
having
much
business
to
do
among
the
people

now
the
object
of
these
lawyers
was
to
get
gain
and
they
got
gain
according
to
their
employ
alma
chapter


now
it
was
in
the
law
of
mosiah
that
every
man
who
was
a
judge
of
the
law
or
those
who
were
appointed
to
be
judges
should
receive
wages
according
to
the
time
which
they
labored
to
judge
those
who
were
brought
before
them
to
be
judged

now
if
a
man
owed
another
and
he
would
not
pay
that
which
he
did
owe
he
was
complained
of
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
executed
authority
and
sent
forth
officers
that
the
man
should
be
brought
before
him
and
he
judged
the
man
according
to
the
law
and
the
evidences
which
were
brought
against
him
and
thus
the
man
was
compelled
to
pay
that
which
he
owed
or
be
stripped
or
be
cast
out
from
among
the
people
as
a
thief
and
a
robber

and
the
judge
received
for
his
wages
according
to
his
timea
senine
of
gold
for
a
day
or
a
senum
of
silver
which
is
equal
to
a
senine
of
gold
and
this
is
according
to
the
law
which
was
given

now
these
are
the
names
of
the
different
pieces
of
their
gold
and
of
their
silver
according
to
their
value
and
the
names
are
given
by
the
nephites
for
they
did
not
reckon
after
the
manner
of
the
jews
who
were
at
jerusalem
neither
did
they
measure
after
the
manner
of
the
jews
but
they
altered
their
reckoning
and
their
measure
according
to
the
minds
and
the
circumstances
of
the
people
in
every
generation
until
the
reign
of
the
judges
they
having
been
established
by
king
mosiah

now
the
reckoning
is
thusa
senine
of
gold
a
seon
of
gold
a
shum
of
gold
and
a
limnah
of
gold

a
senum
of
silver
an
amnor
of
silver
an
ezrom
of
silver
and
an
onti
of
silver

a
senum
of
silver
was
equal
to
a
senine
of
gold
and
either
for
a
measure
of
barley
and
also
for
a
measure
of
every
kind
of
grain

now
the
amount
of
a
seon
of
gold
was
twice
the
value
of
a
senine

and
a
shum
of
gold
was
twice
the
value
of
a
seon

and
a
limnah
of
gold
was
the
value
of
them
all

and
an
amnor
of
silver
was
as
great
as
two
senums

and
an
ezrom
of
silver
was
as
great
as
four
senums

and
an
onti
was
as
great
as
them
all

now
this
is
the
value
of
the
lesser
numbers
of
their
reckoning

a
shiblon
is
half
of
a
senum
therefore
a
shiblon
for
half
a
measure
of
barley

and
a
shiblum
is
a
half
of
a
shiblon

and
a
leah
is
the
half
of
a
shiblum

now
this
is
their
number
according
to
their
reckoning

now
an
antion
of
gold
is
equal
to
three
shiblons

now
it
was
for
the
sole
purpose
to
get
gain
because
they
received
their
wages
according
to
their
employ
therefore
they
did
stir
up
the
people
to
riotings
and
all
manner
of
disturbances
and
wickedness
that
they
might
have
more
employ
that
they
might
get
money
according
to
the
suits
which
were
brought
before
them
therefore
they
did
stir
up
the
people
against
alma
and
amulek

and
this
zeezrom
began
to
question
amulek
saying
will
ye
answer
me
a
few
questions
which
i
shall
ask
you
now
zeezrom
was
a
man
who
was
expert
in
the
devices
of
the
devil
that
he
might
destroy
that
which
was
good
therefore
he
said
unto
amulek
will
ye
answer
the
questions
which
i
shall
put
unto
you

and
amulek
said
unto
him
yea
if
it
be
according
to
the
spirit
of
the
lord
which
is
in
me
for
i
shall
say
nothing
which
is
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
the
lord
and
zeezrom
said
unto
him
behold
here
are
six
onties
of
silver
and
all
these
will
i
give
thee
if
thou
wilt
deny
the
existence
of
a
supreme
being

now
amulek
said
o
thou
child
of
hell
why
tempt
ye
me
knowest
thou
that
the
righteous
yieldeth
to
no
such
temptations

believest
thou
that
there
is
no
god
i
say
unto
you
nay
thou
knowest
that
there
is
a
god
but
thou
lovest
that
lucre
more
than
him

and
now
thou
hast
lied
before
god
unto
me
thou
saidst
unto
mebehold
these
six
onties
which
are
of
great
worth
i
will
give
unto
theewhen
thou
hadst
it
in
thy
heart
to
retain
them
from
me
and
it
was
only
thy
desire
that
i
should
deny
the
true
and
living
god
that
thou
mightest
have
cause
to
destroy
me
and
now
behold
for
this
great
evil
thou
shalt
have
thy
reward

and
zeezrom
said
unto
him
thou
sayest
there
is
a
true
and
living
god

and
amulek
said
yea
there
is
a
true
and
living
god

now
zeezrom
said
is
there
more
than
one
god

and
he
answered
no

now
zeezrom
said
unto
him
again
how
knowest
thou
these
things

and
he
said
an
angel
hath
made
them
known
unto
me

and
zeezrom
said
again
who
is
he
that
shall
come
is
it
the
son
of
god

and
he
said
unto
him
yea

and
zeezrom
said
again
shall
he
save
his
people
in
their
sins
and
amulek
answered
and
said
unto
him
i
say
unto
you
he
shall
not
for
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
deny
his
word

now
zeezrom
said
unto
the
people
see
that
ye
remember
these
things
for
he
said
there
is
but
one
god
yet
he
saith
that
the
son
of
god
shall
come
but
he
shall
not
save
his
peopleas
though
he
had
authority
to
command
god

now
amulek
saith
again
unto
him
behold
thou
hast
lied
for
thou
sayest
that
i
spake
as
though
i
had
authority
to
command
god
because
i
said
he
shall
not
save
his
people
in
their
sins

and
i
say
unto
you
again
that
he
cannot
save
them
in
their
sins
for
i
cannot
deny
his
word
and
he
hath
said
that
no
unclean
thing
can
inherit
the
kingdom
of
heaven
therefore
how
can
ye
be
saved
except
ye
inherit
the
kingdom
of
heaven
therefore
ye
cannot
be
saved
in
your
sins

now
zeezrom
saith
again
unto
him
is
the
son
of
god
the
very
eternal
father

and
amulek
said
unto
him
yea
he
is
the
very
eternal
father
of
heaven
and
of
earth
and
all
things
which
in
them
are
he
is
the
beginning
and
the
end
the
first
and
the
last

and
he
shall
come
into
the
world
to
redeem
his
people
and
he
shall
take
upon
him
the
transgressions
of
those
who
believe
on
his
name
and
these
are
they
that
shall
have
eternal
life
and
salvation
cometh
to
none
else

therefore
the
wicked
remain
as
though
there
had
been
no
redemption
made
except
it
be
the
loosing
of
the
bands
of
death
for
behold
the
day
cometh
that
all
shall
rise
from
the
dead
and
stand
before
god
and
be
judged
according
to
their
works

now
there
is
a
death
which
is
called
a
temporal
death
and
the
death
of
christ
shall
loose
the
bands
of
this
temporal
death
that
all
shall
be
raised
from
this
temporal
death

the
spirit
and
the
body
shall
be
reunited
again
in
its
perfect
form
both
limb
and
joint
shall
be
restored
to
its
proper
frame
even
as
we
now
are
at
this
time
and
we
shall
be
brought
to
stand
before
god
knowing
even
as
we
know
now
and
have
a
bright
recollection
of
all
our
guilt

now
this
restoration
shall
come
to
all
both
old
and
young
both
bond
and
free
both
male
and
female
both
the
wicked
and
the
righteous
and
even
there
shall
not
so
much
as
a
hair
of
their
heads
be
lost
but
every
thing
shall
be
restored
to
its
perfect
frame
as
it
is
now
or
in
the
body
and
shall
be
brought
and
be
arraigned
before
the
bar
of
christ
the
son
and
god
the
father
and
the
holy
spirit
which
is
one
eternal
god
to
be
judged
according
to
their
works
whether
they
be
good
or
whether
they
be
evil

now
behold
i
have
spoken
unto
you
concerning
the
death
of
the
mortal
body
and
also
concerning
the
resurrection
of
the
mortal
body
i
say
unto
you
that
this
mortal
body
is
raised
to
an
immortal
body
that
is
from
death
even
from
the
first
death
unto
life
that
they
can
die
no
more
their
spirits
uniting
with
their
bodies
never
to
be
divided
thus
the
whole
becoming
spiritual
and
immortal
that
they
can
no
more
see
corruption

now
when
amulek
had
finished
these
words
the
people
began
again
to
be
astonished
and
also
zeezrom
began
to
tremble
and
thus
ended
the
words
of
amulek
or
this
is
all
that
i
have
written
alma
chapter


now
alma
seeing
that
the
words
of
amulek
had
silenced
zeezrom
for
he
beheld
that
amulek
had
caught
him
in
his
lying
and
deceiving
to
destroy
him
and
seeing
that
he
began
to
tremble
under
a
consciousness
of
his
guilt
he
opened
his
mouth
and
began
to
speak
unto
him
and
to
establish
the
words
of
amulek
and
to
explain
things
beyond
or
to
unfold
the
scriptures
beyond
that
which
amulek
had
done

now
the
words
that
alma
spake
unto
zeezrom
were
heard
by
the
people
round
about
for
the
multitude
was
great
and
he
spake
on
this
wise

now
zeezrom
seeing
that
thou
hast
been
taken
in
thy
lying
and
craftiness
for
thou
hast
not
lied
unto
men
only
but
thou
hast
lied
unto
god
for
behold
he
knows
all
thy
thoughts
and
thou
seest
that
thy
thoughts
are
made
known
unto
us
by
his
spirit

and
thou
seest
that
we
know
that
thy
plan
was
a
very
subtle
plan
as
to
the
subtlety
of
the
devil
for
to
lie
and
to
deceive
this
people
that
thou
mightest
set
them
against
us
to
revile
us
and
to
cast
us
out

now
this
was
a
plan
of
thine
adversary
and
he
hath
exercised
his
power
in
thee
now
i
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
what
i
say
unto
thee
i
say
unto
all

and
behold
i
say
unto
you
all
that
this
was
a
snare
of
the
adversary
which
he
has
laid
to
catch
this
people
that
he
might
bring
you
into
subjection
unto
him
that
he
might
encircle
you
about
with
his
chains
that
he
might
chain
you
down
to
everlasting
destruction
according
to
the
power
of
his
captivity

now
when
alma
had
spoken
these
words
zeezrom
began
to
tremble
more
exceedingly
for
he
was
convinced
more
and
more
of
the
power
of
god
and
he
was
also
convinced
that
alma
and
amulek
had
a
knowledge
of
him
for
he
was
convinced
that
they
knew
the
thoughts
and
intents
of
his
heart
for
power
was
given
unto
them
that
they
might
know
of
these
things
according
to
the
spirit
of
prophecy

and
zeezrom
began
to
inquire
of
them
diligently
that
he
might
know
more
concerning
the
kingdom
of
god
and
he
said
unto
alma
what
does
this
mean
which
amulek
hath
spoken
concerning
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
that
all
shall
rise
from
the
dead
both
the
just
and
the
unjust
and
are
brought
to
stand
before
god
to
be
judged
according
to
their
works

and
now
alma
began
to
expound
these
things
unto
him
saying
it
is
given
unto
many
to
know
the
mysteries
of
god
nevertheless
they
are
laid
under
a
strict
command
that
they
shall
not
impart
only
according
to
the
portion
of
his
word
which
he
doth
grant
unto
the
children
of
men
according
to
the
heed
and
diligence
which
they
give
unto
him

and
therefore
he
that
will
harden
his
heart
the
same
receiveth
the
lesser
portion
of
the
word
and
he
that
will
not
harden
his
heart
to
him
is
given
the
greater
portion
of
the
word
until
it
is
given
unto
him
to
know
the
mysteries
of
god
until
he
know
them
in
full

and
they
that
will
harden
their
hearts
to
them
is
given
the
lesser
portion
of
the
word
until
they
know
nothing
concerning
his
mysteries
and
then
they
are
taken
captive
by
the
devil
and
led
by
his
will
down
to
destruction
now
this
is
what
is
meant
by
the
chains
of
hell

and
amulek
hath
spoken
plainly
concerning
death
and
being
raised
from
this
mortality
to
a
state
of
immortality
and
being
brought
before
the
bar
of
god
to
be
judged
according
to
our
works

then
if
our
hearts
have
been
hardened
yea
if
we
have
hardened
our
hearts
against
the
word
insomuch
that
it
has
not
been
found
in
us
then
will
our
state
be
awful
for
then
we
shall
be
condemned

for
our
words
will
condemn
us
yea
all
our
works
will
condemn
us
we
shall
not
be
found
spotless
and
our
thoughts
will
also
condemn
us
and
in
this
awful
state
we
shall
not
dare
to
look
up
to
our
god
and
we
would
fain
be
glad
if
we
could
command
the
rocks
and
the
mountains
to
fall
upon
us
to
hide
us
from
his
presence

but
this
cannot
be
we
must
come
forth
and
stand
before
him
in
his
glory
and
in
his
power
and
in
his
might
majesty
and
dominion
and
acknowledge
to
our
everlasting
shame
that
all
his
judgments
are
just
that
he
is
just
in
all
his
works
and
that
he
is
merciful
unto
the
children
of
men
and
that
he
has
all
power
to
save
every
man
that
believeth
on
his
name
and
bringeth
forth
fruit
meet
for
repentance

and
now
behold
i
say
unto
you
then
cometh
a
death
even
a
second
death
which
is
a
spiritual
death
then
is
a
time
that
whosoever
dieth
in
his
sins
as
to
a
temporal
death
shall
also
die
a
spiritual
death
yea
he
shall
die
as
to
things
pertaining
unto
righteousness

then
is
the
time
when
their
torments
shall
be
as
a
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
whose
flame
ascendeth
up
forever
and
ever
and
then
is
the
time
that
they
shall
be
chained
down
to
an
everlasting
destruction
according
to
the
power
and
captivity
of
satan
he
having
subjected
them
according
to
his
will

then
i
say
unto
you
they
shall
be
as
though
there
had
been
no
redemption
made
for
they
cannot
be
redeemed
according
to
gods
justice
and
they
cannot
die
seeing
there
is
no
more
corruption

now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
alma
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
these
words
the
people
began
to
be
more
astonished

but
there
was
one
antionah
who
was
a
chief
ruler
among
them
came
forth
and
said
unto
him
what
is
this
that
thou
hast
said
that
man
should
rise
from
the
dead
and
be
changed
from
this
mortal
to
an
immortal
state
that
the
soul
can
never
die

what
does
the
scripture
mean
which
saith
that
god
placed
cherubim
and
a
flaming
sword
on
the
east
of
the
garden
of
eden
lest
our
first
parents
should
enter
and
partake
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
life
and
live
forever
and
thus
we
see
that
there
was
no
possible
chance
that
they
should
live
forever

now
alma
said
unto
him
this
is
the
thing
which
i
was
about
to
explain
now
we
see
that
adam
did
fall
by
the
partaking
of
the
forbidden
fruit
according
to
the
word
of
god
and
thus
we
see
that
by
his
fall
all
mankind
became
a
lost
and
fallen
people

and
now
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
if
it
had
been
possible
for
adam
to
have
partaken
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
life
at
that
time
there
would
have
been
no
death
and
the
word
would
have
been
void
making
god
a
liar
for
he
said
if
thou
eat
thou
shalt
surely
die

and
we
see
that
death
comes
upon
mankind
yea
the
death
which
has
been
spoken
of
by
amulek
which
is
the
temporal
death
nevertheless
there
was
a
space
granted
unto
man
in
which
he
might
repent
therefore
this
life
became
a
probationary
state
a
time
to
prepare
to
meet
god
a
time
to
prepare
for
that
endless
state
which
has
been
spoken
of
by
us
which
is
after
the
resurrection
of
the
dead

now
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
plan
of
redemption
which
was
laid
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
there
could
have
been
no
resurrection
of
the
dead
but
there
was
a
plan
of
redemption
laid
which
shall
bring
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
of
which
has
been
spoken

and
now
behold
if
it
were
possible
that
our
first
parents
could
have
gone
forth
and
partaken
of
the
tree
of
life
they
would
have
been
forever
miserable
having
no
preparatory
state
and
thus
the
plan
of
redemption
would
have
been
frustrated
and
the
word
of
god
would
have
been
void
taking
none
effect

but
behold
it
was
not
so
but
it
was
appointed
unto
men
that
they
must
die
and
after
death
they
must
come
to
judgment
even
that
same
judgment
of
which
we
have
spoken
which
is
the
end

and
after
god
had
appointed
that
these
things
should
come
unto
man
behold
then
he
saw
that
it
was
expedient
that
man
should
know
concerning
the
things
whereof
he
had
appointed
unto
them

therefore
he
sent
angels
to
converse
with
them
who
caused
men
to
behold
of
his
glory

and
they
began
from
that
time
forth
to
call
on
his
name
therefore
god
conversed
with
men
and
made
known
unto
them
the
plan
of
redemption
which
had
been
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
and
this
he
made
known
unto
them
according
to
their
faith
and
repentance
and
their
holy
works

wherefore
he
gave
commandments
unto
men
they
having
first
transgressed
the
first
commandments
as
to
things
which
were
temporal
and
becoming
as
gods
knowing
good
from
evil
placing
themselves
in
a
state
to
act
or
being
placed
in
a
state
to
act
according
to
their
wills
and
pleasures
whether
to
do
evil
or
to
do
good

therefore
god
gave
unto
them
commandments
after
having
made
known
unto
them
the
plan
of
redemption
that
they
should
not
do
evil
the
penalty
thereof
being
a
second
death
which
was
an
everlasting
death
as
to
things
pertaining
unto
righteousness
for
on
such
the
plan
of
redemption
could
have
no
power
for
the
works
of
justice
could
not
be
destroyed
according
to
the
supreme
goodness
of
god

but
god
did
call
on
men
in
the
name
of
his
son
this
being
the
plan
of
redemption
which
was
laid
saying
if
ye
will
repent
and
harden
not
your
hearts
then
will
i
have
mercy
upon
you
through
mine
only
begotten
son

therefore
whosoever
repenteth
and
hardeneth
not
his
heart
he
shall
have
claim
on
mercy
through
mine
only
begotten
son
unto
a
remission
of
his
sins
and
these
shall
enter
into
my
rest

and
whosoever
will
harden
his
heart
and
will
do
iniquity
behold
i
swear
in
my
wrath
that
he
shall
not
enter
into
my
rest

and
now
my
brethren
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
if
ye
will
harden
your
hearts
ye
shall
not
enter
into
the
rest
of
the
lord
therefore
your
iniquity
provoketh
him
that
he
sendeth
down
his
wrath
upon
you
as
in
the
first
provocation
yea
according
to
his
word
in
the
last
provocation
as
well
as
the
first
to
the
everlasting
destruction
of
your
souls
therefore
according
to
his
word
unto
the
last
death
as
well
as
the
first

and
now
my
brethren
seeing
we
know
these
things
and
they
are
true
let
us
repent
and
harden
not
our
hearts
that
we
provoke
not
the
lord
our
god
to
pull
down
his
wrath
upon
us
in
these
his
second
commandments
which
he
has
given
unto
us
but
let
us
enter
into
the
rest
of
god
which
is
prepared
according
to
his
word
alma
chapter


and
again
my
brethren
i
would
cite
your
minds
forward
to
the
time
when
the
lord
god
gave
these
commandments
unto
his
children
and
i
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
the
lord
god
ordained
priests
after
his
holy
order
which
was
after
the
order
of
his
son
to
teach
these
things
unto
the
people

and
those
priests
were
ordained
after
the
order
of
his
son
in
a
manner
that
thereby
the
people
might
know
in
what
manner
to
look
forward
to
his
son
for
redemption

and
this
is
the
manner
after
which
they
were
ordainedbeing
called
and
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
according
to
the
foreknowledge
of
god
on
account
of
their
exceeding
faith
and
good
works
in
the
first
place
being
left
to
choose
good
or
evil
therefore
they
having
chosen
good
and
exercising
exceedingly
great
faith
are
called
with
a
holy
calling
yea
with
that
holy
calling
which
was
prepared
with
and
according
to
a
preparatory
redemption
for
such

and
thus
they
have
been
called
to
this
holy
calling
on
account
of
their
faith
while
others
would
reject
the
spirit
of
god
on
account
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
blindness
of
their
minds
while
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
they
might
have
had
as
great
privilege
as
their
brethren

or
in
fine
in
the
first
place
they
were
on
the
same
standing
with
their
brethren
thus
this
holy
calling
being
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
for
such
as
would
not
harden
their
hearts
being
in
and
through
the
atonement
of
the
only
begotten
son
who
was
prepared

and
thus
being
called
by
this
holy
calling
and
ordained
unto
the
high
priesthood
of
the
holy
order
of
god
to
teach
his
commandments
unto
the
children
of
men
that
they
also
might
enter
into
his
rest

this
high
priesthood
being
after
the
order
of
his
son
which
order
was
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
or
in
other
words
being
without
beginning
of
days
or
end
of
years
being
prepared
from
eternity
to
all
eternity
according
to
his
foreknowledge
of
all
things

now
they
were
ordained
after
this
mannerbeing
called
with
a
holy
calling
and
ordained
with
a
holy
ordinance
and
taking
upon
them
the
high
priesthood
of
the
holy
order
which
calling
and
ordinance
and
high
priesthood
is
without
beginning
or
end

thus
they
become
high
priests
forever
after
the
order
of
the
son
the
only
begotten
of
the
father
who
is
without
beginning
of
days
or
end
of
years
who
is
full
of
grace
equity
and
truth
and
thus
it
is
amen

now
as
i
said
concerning
the
holy
order
or
this
high
priesthood
there
were
many
who
were
ordained
and
became
high
priests
of
god
and
it
was
on
account
of
their
exceeding
faith
and
repentance
and
their
righteousness
before
god
they
choosing
to
repent
and
work
righteousness
rather
than
to
perish

therefore
they
were
called
after
this
holy
order
and
were
sanctified
and
their
garments
were
washed
white
through
the
blood
of
the
lamb

now
they
after
being
sanctified
by
the
holy
ghost
having
their
garments
made
white
being
pure
and
spotless
before
god
could
not
look
upon
sin
save
it
were
with
abhorrence
and
there
were
many
exceedingly
great
many
who
were
made
pure
and
entered
into
the
rest
of
the
lord
their
god

and
now
my
brethren
i
would
that
ye
should
humble
yourselves
before
god
and
bring
forth
fruit
meet
for
repentance
that
ye
may
also
enter
into
that
rest

yea
humble
yourselves
even
as
the
people
in
the
days
of
melchizedek
who
was
also
a
high
priest
after
this
same
order
which
i
have
spoken
who
also
took
upon
him
the
high
priesthood
forever

and
it
was
this
same
melchizedek
to
whom
abraham
paid
tithes
yea
even
our
father
abraham
paid
tithes
of
onetenth
part
of
all
he
possessed

now
these
ordinances
were
given
after
this
manner
that
thereby
the
people
might
look
forward
on
the
son
of
god
it
being
a
type
of
his
order
or
it
being
his
order
and
this
that
they
might
look
forward
to
him
for
a
remission
of
their
sins
that
they
might
enter
into
the
rest
of
the
lord

now
this
melchizedek
was
a
king
over
the
land
of
salem
and
his
people
had
waxed
strong
in
iniquity
and
abomination
yea
they
had
all
gone
astray
they
were
full
of
all
manner
of
wickedness

but
melchizedek
having
exercised
mighty
faith
and
received
the
office
of
the
high
priesthood
according
to
the
holy
order
of
god
did
preach
repentance
unto
his
people
and
behold
they
did
repent
and
melchizedek
did
establish
peace
in
the
land
in
his
days
therefore
he
was
called
the
prince
of
peace
for
he
was
the
king
of
salem
and
he
did
reign
under
his
father

now
there
were
many
before
him
and
also
there
were
many
afterwards
but
none
were
greater
therefore
of
him
they
have
more
particularly
made
mention

now
i
need
not
rehearse
the
matter
what
i
have
said
may
suffice
behold
the
scriptures
are
before
you
if
ye
will
wrest
them
it
shall
be
to
your
own
destruction

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
alma
had
said
these
words
unto
them
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
unto
them
and
cried
with
a
mighty
voice
saying
now
is
the
time
to
repent
for
the
day
of
salvation
draweth
nigh

yea
and
the
voice
of
the
lord
by
the
mouth
of
angels
doth
declare
it
unto
all
nations
yea
doth
declare
it
that
they
may
have
glad
tidings
of
great
joy
yea
and
he
doth
sound
these
glad
tidings
among
all
his
people
yea
even
to
them
that
are
scattered
abroad
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
wherefore
they
have
come
unto
us

and
they
are
made
known
unto
us
in
plain
terms
that
we
may
understand
that
we
cannot
err
and
this
because
of
our
being
wanderers
in
a
strange
land
therefore
we
are
thus
highly
favored
for
we
have
these
glad
tidings
declared
unto
us
in
all
parts
of
our
vineyard

for
behold
angels
are
declaring
it
unto
many
at
this
time
in
our
land
and
this
is
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
to
receive
his
word
at
the
time
of
his
coming
in
his
glory

and
now
we
only
wait
to
hear
the
joyful
news
declared
unto
us
by
the
mouth
of
angels
of
his
coming
for
the
time
cometh
we
know
not
how
soon
would
to
god
that
it
might
be
in
my
day
but
let
it
be
sooner
or
later
in
it
i
will
rejoice

and
it
shall
be
made
known
unto
just
and
holy
men
by
the
mouth
of
angels
at
the
time
of
his
coming
that
the
words
of
our
fathers
may
be
fulfilled
according
to
that
which
they
have
spoken
concerning
him
which
was
according
to
the
spirit
of
prophecy
which
was
in
them

and
now
my
brethren
i
wish
from
the
inmost
part
of
my
heart
yea
with
great
anxiety
even
unto
pain
that
ye
would
hearken
unto
my
words
and
cast
off
your
sins
and
not
procrastinate
the
day
of
your
repentance

but
that
ye
would
humble
yourselves
before
the
lord
and
call
on
his
holy
name
and
watch
and
pray
continually
that
ye
may
not
be
tempted
above
that
which
ye
can
bear
and
thus
be
led
by
the
holy
spirit
becoming
humble
meek
submissive
patient
full
of
love
and
all
longsuffering

having
faith
on
the
lord
having
a
hope
that
ye
shall
receive
eternal
life
having
the
love
of
god
always
in
your
hearts
that
ye
may
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day
and
enter
into
his
rest

and
may
the
lord
grant
unto
you
repentance
that
ye
may
not
bring
down
his
wrath
upon
you
that
ye
may
not
be
bound
down
by
the
chains
of
hell
that
ye
may
not
suffer
the
second
death

and
alma
spake
many
more
words
unto
the
people
which
are
not
written
in
this
book
alma
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
after
he
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
the
people
many
of
them
did
believe
on
his
words
and
began
to
repent
and
to
search
the
scriptures

but
the
more
part
of
them
were
desirous
that
they
might
destroy
alma
and
amulek
for
they
were
angry
with
alma
because
of
the
plainness
of
his
words
unto
zeezrom
and
they
also
said
that
amulek
had
lied
unto
them
and
had
reviled
against
their
law
and
also
against
their
lawyers
and
judges

and
they
were
also
angry
with
alma
and
amulek
and
because
they
had
testified
so
plainly
against
their
wickedness
they
sought
to
put
them
away
privily

but
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
not
but
they
took
them
and
bound
them
with
strong
cords
and
took
them
before
the
chief
judge
of
the
land

and
the
people
went
forth
and
witnessed
against
themtestifying
that
they
had
reviled
against
the
law
and
their
lawyers
and
judges
of
the
land
and
also
of
all
the
people
that
were
in
the
land
and
also
testified
that
there
was
but
one
god
and
that
he
should
send
his
son
among
the
people
but
he
should
not
save
them
and
many
such
things
did
the
people
testify
against
alma
and
amulek
now
this
was
done
before
the
chief
judge
of
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
zeezrom
was
astonished
at
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
and
he
also
knew
concerning
the
blindness
of
the
minds
which
he
had
caused
among
the
people
by
his
lying
words
and
his
soul
began
to
be
harrowed
up
under
a
consciousness
of
his
own
guilt
yea
he
began
to
be
encircled
about
by
the
pains
of
hell

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
began
to
cry
unto
the
people
saying
behold
i
am
guilty
and
these
men
are
spotless
before
god
and
he
began
to
plead
for
them
from
that
time
forth
but
they
reviled
him
saying
art
thou
also
possessed
with
the
devil
and
they
spit
upon
him
and
cast
him
out
from
among
them
and
also
all
those
who
believed
in
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
by
alma
and
amulek
and
they
cast
them
out
and
sent
men
to
cast
stones
at
them

and
they
brought
their
wives
and
children
together
and
whosoever
believed
or
had
been
taught
to
believe
in
the
word
of
god
they
caused
that
they
should
be
cast
into
the
fire
and
they
also
brought
forth
their
records
which
contained
the
holy
scriptures
and
cast
them
into
the
fire
also
that
they
might
be
burned
and
destroyed
by
fire

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
took
alma
and
amulek
and
carried
them
forth
to
the
place
of
martyrdom
that
they
might
witness
the
destruction
of
those
who
were
consumed
by
fire

and
when
amulek
saw
the
pains
of
the
women
and
children
who
were
consuming
in
the
fire
he
also
was
pained
and
he
said
unto
alma
how
can
we
witness
this
awful
scene
therefore
let
us
stretch
forth
our
hands
and
exercise
the
power
of
god
which
is
in
us
and
save
them
from
the
flames

but
alma
said
unto
him
the
spirit
constraineth
me
that
i
must
not
stretch
forth
mine
hand
for
behold
the
lord
receiveth
them
up
unto
himself
in
glory
and
he
doth
suffer
that
they
may
do
this
thing
or
that
the
people
may
do
this
thing
unto
them
according
to
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
that
the
judgments
which
he
shall
exercise
upon
them
in
his
wrath
may
be
just
and
the
blood
of
the
innocent
shall
stand
as
a
witness
against
them
yea
and
cry
mightily
against
them
at
the
last
day

now
amulek
said
unto
alma
behold
perhaps
they
will
burn
us
also

and
alma
said
be
it
according
to
the
will
of
the
lord
but
behold
our
work
is
not
finished
therefore
they
burn
us
not

now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
bodies
of
those
who
had
been
cast
into
the
fire
were
consumed
and
also
the
records
which
were
cast
in
with
them
the
chief
judge
of
the
land
came
and
stood
before
alma
and
amulek
as
they
were
bound
and
he
smote
them
with
his
hand
upon
their
cheeks
and
said
unto
them
after
what
ye
have
seen
will
ye
preach
again
unto
this
people
that
they
shall
be
cast
into
a
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone

behold
ye
see
that
ye
had
not
power
to
save
those
who
had
been
cast
into
the
fire
neither
has
god
saved
them
because
they
were
of
thy
faith
and
the
judge
smote
them
again
upon
their
cheeks
and
asked
what
say
ye
for
yourselves

now
this
judge
was
after
the
order
and
faith
of
nehor
who
slew
gideon

and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
and
amulek
answered
him
nothing
and
he
smote
them
again
and
delivered
them
to
the
officers
to
be
cast
into
prison

and
when
they
had
been
cast
into
prison
three
days
there
came
many
lawyers
and
judges
and
priests
and
teachers
who
were
of
the
profession
of
nehor
and
they
came
in
unto
the
prison
to
see
them
and
they
questioned
them
about
many
words
but
they
answered
them
nothing

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
judge
stood
before
them
and
said
why
do
ye
not
answer
the
words
of
this
people
know
ye
not
that
i
have
power
to
deliver
you
up
unto
the
flames
and
he
commanded
them
to
speak
but
they
answered
nothing

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
departed
and
went
their
ways
but
came
again
on
the
morrow
and
the
judge
also
smote
them
again
on
their
cheeks
and
many
came
forth
also
and
smote
them
saying
will
ye
stand
again
and
judge
this
people
and
condemn
our
law
if
ye
have
such
great
power
why
do
ye
not
deliver
yourselves

and
many
such
things
did
they
say
unto
them
gnashing
their
teeth
upon
them
and
spitting
upon
them
and
saying
how
shall
we
look
when
we
are
damned

and
many
such
things
yea
all
manner
of
such
things
did
they
say
unto
them
and
thus
they
did
mock
them
for
many
days
and
they
did
withhold
food
from
them
that
they
might
hunger
and
water
that
they
might
thirst
and
they
also
did
take
from
them
their
clothes
that
they
were
naked
and
thus
they
were
bound
with
strong
cords
and
confined
in
prison

and
it
came
to
pass
after
they
had
thus
suffered
for
many
days
and
it
was
on
the
twelfth
day
in
the
tenth
month
in
the
tenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
that
the
chief
judge
over
the
land
of
ammonihah
and
many
of
their
teachers
and
their
lawyers
went
in
unto
the
prison
where
alma
and
amulek
were
bound
with
cords

and
the
chief
judge
stood
before
them
and
smote
them
again
and
said
unto
them
if
ye
have
the
power
of
god
deliver
yourselves
from
these
bands
and
then
we
will
believe
that
the
lord
will
destroy
this
people
according
to
your
words

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
all
went
forth
and
smote
them
saying
the
same
words
even
until
the
last
and
when
the
last
had
spoken
unto
them
the
power
of
god
was
upon
alma
and
amulek
and
they
rose
and
stood
upon
their
feet

and
alma
cried
saying
how
long
shall
we
suffer
these
great
afflictions
o
lord
o
lord
give
us
strength
according
to
our
faith
which
is
in
christ
even
unto
deliverance
and
they
broke
the
cords
with
which
they
were
bound
and
when
the
people
saw
this
they
began
to
flee
for
the
fear
of
destruction
had
come
upon
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
so
great
was
their
fear
that
they
fell
to
the
earth
and
did
not
obtain
the
outer
door
of
the
prison
and
the
earth
shook
mightily
and
the
walls
of
the
prison
were
rent
in
twain
so
that
they
fell
to
the
earth
and
the
chief
judge
and
the
lawyers
and
priests
and
teachers
who
smote
upon
alma
and
amulek
were
slain
by
the
fall
thereof

and
alma
and
amulek
came
forth
out
of
the
prison
and
they
were
not
hurt
for
the
lord
had
granted
unto
them
power
according
to
their
faith
which
was
in
christ
and
they
straightway
came
forth
out
of
the
prison
and
they
were
loosed
from
their
bands
and
the
prison
had
fallen
to
the
earth
and
every
soul
within
the
walls
thereof
save
it
were
alma
and
amulek
was
slain
and
they
straightway
came
forth
into
the
city

now
the
people
having
heard
a
great
noise
came
running
together
by
multitudes
to
know
the
cause
of
it
and
when
they
saw
alma
and
amulek
coming
forth
out
of
the
prison
and
the
walls
thereof
had
fallen
to
the
earth
they
were
struck
with
great
fear
and
fled
from
the
presence
of
alma
and
amulek
even
as
a
goat
fleeth
with
her
young
from
two
lions
and
thus
they
did
flee
from
the
presence
of
alma
and
amulek
alma
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
and
amulek
were
commanded
to
depart
out
of
that
city
and
they
departed
and
came
out
even
into
the
land
of
sidom
and
behold
there
they
found
all
the
people
who
had
departed
out
of
the
land
of
ammonihah
who
had
been
cast
out
and
stoned
because
they
believed
in
the
words
of
alma

and
they
related
unto
them
all
that
had
happened
unto
their
wives
and
children
and
also
concerning
themselves
and
of
their
power
of
deliverance

and
also
zeezrom
lay
sick
at
sidom
with
a
burning
fever
which
was
caused
by
the
great
tribulations
of
his
mind
on
account
of
his
wickedness
for
he
supposed
that
alma
and
amulek
were
no
more
and
he
supposed
that
they
had
been
slain
because
of
his
iniquity
and
this
great
sin
and
his
many
other
sins
did
harrow
up
his
mind
until
it
did
become
exceedingly
sore
having
no
deliverance
therefore
he
began
to
be
scorched
with
a
burning
heat

now
when
he
heard
that
alma
and
amulek
were
in
the
land
of
sidom
his
heart
began
to
take
courage
and
he
sent
a
message
immediately
unto
them
desiring
them
to
come
unto
him

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
immediately
obeying
the
message
which
he
had
sent
unto
them
and
they
went
in
unto
the
house
unto
zeezrom
and
they
found
him
upon
his
bed
sick
being
very
low
with
a
burning
fever
and
his
mind
also
was
exceedingly
sore
because
of
his
iniquities
and
when
he
saw
them
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
besought
them
that
they
would
heal
him

and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
said
unto
him
taking
him
by
the
hand
believest
thou
in
the
power
of
christ
unto
salvation

and
he
answered
and
said
yea
i
believe
all
the
words
that
thou
hast
taught

and
alma
said
if
thou
believest
in
the
redemption
of
christ
thou
canst
be
healed

and
he
said
yea
i
believe
according
to
thy
words

and
then
alma
cried
unto
the
lord
saying
o
lord
our
god
have
mercy
on
this
man
and
heal
him
according
to
his
faith
which
is
in
christ

and
when
alma
had
said
these
words
zeezrom
leaped
upon
his
feet
and
began
to
walk
and
this
was
done
to
the
great
astonishment
of
all
the
people
and
the
knowledge
of
this
went
forth
throughout
all
the
land
of
sidom

and
alma
baptized
zeezrom
unto
the
lord
and
he
began
from
that
time
forth
to
preach
unto
the
people

and
alma
established
a
church
in
the
land
of
sidom
and
consecrated
priests
and
teachers
in
the
land
to
baptize
unto
the
lord
whosoever
were
desirous
to
be
baptized

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
many
for
they
did
flock
in
from
all
the
region
round
about
sidom
and
were
baptized

but
as
to
the
people
that
were
in
the
land
of
ammonihah
they
yet
remained
a
hardhearted
and
a
stiffnecked
people
and
they
repented
not
of
their
sins
ascribing
all
the
power
of
alma
and
amulek
to
the
devil
for
they
were
of
the
profession
of
nehor
and
did
not
believe
in
the
repentance
of
their
sins

and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
and
amulek
amulek
having
forsaken
all
his
gold
and
silver
and
his
precious
things
which
were
in
the
land
of
ammonihah
for
the
word
of
god
he
being
rejected
by
those
who
were
once
his
friends
and
also
by
his
father
and
his
kindred

therefore
after
alma
having
established
the
church
at
sidom
seeing
a
great
check
yea
seeing
that
the
people
were
checked
as
to
the
pride
of
their
hearts
and
began
to
humble
themselves
before
god
and
began
to
assemble
themselves
together
at
their
sanctuaries
to
worship
god
before
the
altar
watching
and
praying
continually
that
they
might
be
delivered
from
satan
and
from
death
and
from
destruction

now
as
i
said
alma
having
seen
all
these
things
therefore
he
took
amulek
and
came
over
to
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
took
him
to
his
own
house
and
did
administer
unto
him
in
his
tribulations
and
strengthened
him
in
the
lord

and
thus
ended
the
tenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
alma
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eleventh
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
on
the
fifth
day
of
the
second
month
there
having
been
much
peace
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
there
having
been
no
wars
nor
contentions
for
a
certain
number
of
years
even
until
the
fifth
day
of
the
second
month
in
the
eleventh
year
there
was
a
cry
of
war
heard
throughout
the
land

for
behold
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
had
come
in
upon
the
wilderness
side
into
the
borders
of
the
land
even
into
the
city
of
ammonihah
and
began
to
slay
the
people
and
destroy
the
city

and
now
it
came
to
pass
before
the
nephites
could
raise
a
sufficient
army
to
drive
them
out
of
the
land
they
had
destroyed
the
people
who
were
in
the
city
of
ammonihah
and
also
some
around
the
borders
of
noah
and
taken
others
captive
into
the
wilderness

now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
nephites
were
desirous
to
obtain
those
who
had
been
carried
away
captive
into
the
wilderness

therefore
he
that
had
been
appointed
chief
captain
over
the
armies
of
the
nephites
and
his
name
was
zoram
and
he
had
two
sons
lehi
and
ahanow
zoram
and
his
two
sons
knowing
that
alma
was
high
priest
over
the
church
and
having
heard
that
he
had
the
spirit
of
prophecy
therefore
they
went
unto
him
and
desired
of
him
to
know
whither
the
lord
would
that
they
should
go
into
the
wilderness
in
search
of
their
brethren
who
had
been
taken
captive
by
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
inquired
of
the
lord
concerning
the
matter
and
alma
returned
and
said
unto
them
behold
the
lamanites
will
cross
the
river
sidon
in
the
south
wilderness
away
up
beyond
the
borders
of
the
land
of
manti
and
behold
there
shall
ye
meet
them
on
the
east
of
the
river
sidon
and
there
the
lord
will
deliver
unto
thee
thy
brethren
who
have
been
taken
captive
by
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
zoram
and
his
sons
crossed
over
the
river
sidon
with
their
armies
and
marched
away
beyond
the
borders
of
manti
into
the
south
wilderness
which
was
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
sidon

and
they
came
upon
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
and
the
lamanites
were
scattered
and
driven
into
the
wilderness
and
they
took
their
brethren
who
had
been
taken
captive
by
the
lamanites
and
there
was
not
one
soul
of
them
had
been
lost
that
were
taken
captive
and
they
were
brought
by
their
brethren
to
possess
their
own
lands

and
thus
ended
the
eleventh
year
of
the
judges
the
lamanites
having
been
driven
out
of
the
land
and
the
people
of
ammonihah
were
destroyed
yea
every
living
soul
of
the
ammonihahites
was
destroyed
and
also
their
great
city
which
they
said
god
could
not
destroy
because
of
its
greatness

but
behold
in
one
day
it
was
left
desolate
and
the
carcasses
were
mangled
by
dogs
and
wild
beasts
of
the
wilderness

nevertheless
after
many
days
their
dead
bodies
were
heaped
up
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
they
were
covered
with
a
shallow
covering
and
now
so
great
was
the
scent
thereof
that
the
people
did
not
go
in
to
possess
the
land
of
ammonihah
for
many
years
and
it
was
called
desolation
of
nehors
for
they
were
of
the
profession
of
nehor
who
were
slain
and
their
lands
remained
desolate

and
the
lamanites
did
not
come
again
to
war
against
the
nephites
until
the
fourteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
and
thus
for
three
years
did
the
people
of
nephi
have
continual
peace
in
all
the
land

and
alma
and
amulek
went
forth
preaching
repentance
to
the
people
in
their
temples
and
in
their
sanctuaries
and
also
in
their
synagogues
which
were
built
after
the
manner
of
the
jews

and
as
many
as
would
hear
their
words
unto
them
they
did
impart
the
word
of
god
without
any
respect
of
persons
continually

and
thus
did
alma
and
amulek
go
forth
and
also
many
more
who
had
been
chosen
for
the
work
to
preach
the
word
throughout
all
the
land
and
the
establishment
of
the
church
became
general
throughout
the
land
in
all
the
region
round
about
among
all
the
people
of
the
nephites

and
there
was
no
inequality
among
them
the
lord
did
pour
out
his
spirit
on
all
the
face
of
the
land
to
prepare
the
minds
of
the
children
of
men
or
to
prepare
their
hearts
to
receive
the
word
which
should
be
taught
among
them
at
the
time
of
his
coming

that
they
might
not
be
hardened
against
the
word
that
they
might
not
be
unbelieving
and
go
on
to
destruction
but
that
they
might
receive
the
word
with
joy
and
as
a
branch
be
grafted
into
the
true
vine
that
they
might
enter
into
the
rest
of
the
lord
their
god

now
those
priests
who
did
go
forth
among
the
people
did
preach
against
all
lyings
and
deceivings
and
envyings
and
strifes
and
malice
and
revilings
and
stealing
robbing
plundering
murdering
committing
adultery
and
all
manner
of
lasciviousness
crying
that
these
things
ought
not
so
to
be

holding
forth
things
which
must
shortly
come
yea
holding
forth
the
coming
of
the
son
of
god
his
sufferings
and
death
and
also
the
resurrection
of
the
dead

and
many
of
the
people
did
inquire
concerning
the
place
where
the
son
of
god
should
come
and
they
were
taught
that
he
would
appear
unto
them
after
his
resurrection
and
this
the
people
did
hear
with
great
joy
and
gladness

and
now
after
the
church
had
been
established
throughout
all
the
landhaving
got
the
victory
over
the
devil
and
the
word
of
god
being
preached
in
its
purity
in
all
the
land
and
the
lord
pouring
out
his
blessings
upon
the
peoplethus
ended
the
fourteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
alma
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
as
alma
was
journeying
from
the
land
of
gideon
southward
away
to
the
land
of
manti
behold
to
his
astonishment
he
met
with
the
sons
of
mosiah
journeying
towards
the
land
of
zarahemla

now
these
sons
of
mosiah
were
with
alma
at
the
time
the
angel
first
appeared
unto
him
therefore
alma
did
rejoice
exceedingly
to
see
his
brethren
and
what
added
more
to
his
joy
they
were
still
his
brethren
in
the
lord
yea
and
they
had
waxed
strong
in
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
for
they
were
men
of
a
sound
understanding
and
they
had
searched
the
scriptures
diligently
that
they
might
know
the
word
of
god

but
this
is
not
all
they
had
given
themselves
to
much
prayer
and
fasting
therefore
they
had
the
spirit
of
prophecy
and
the
spirit
of
revelation
and
when
they
taught
they
taught
with
power
and
authority
of
god

and
they
had
been
teaching
the
word
of
god
for
the
space
of
fourteen
years
among
the
lamanites
having
had
much
success
in
bringing
many
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
yea
by
the
power
of
their
words
many
were
brought
before
the
altar
of
god
to
call
on
his
name
and
confess
their
sins
before
him

now
these
are
the
circumstances
which
attended
them
in
their
journeyings
for
they
had
many
afflictions
they
did
suffer
much
both
in
body
and
in
mind
such
as
hunger
thirst
and
fatigue
and
also
much
labor
in
the
spirit

now
these
were
their
journeyings
having
taken
leave
of
their
father
mosiah
in
the
first
year
of
the
judges
having
refused
the
kingdom
which
their
father
was
desirous
to
confer
upon
them
and
also
this
was
the
minds
of
the
people

nevertheless
they
departed
out
of
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
took
their
swords
and
their
spears
and
their
bows
and
their
arrows
and
their
slings
and
this
they
did
that
they
might
provide
food
for
themselves
while
in
the
wilderness

and
thus
they
departed
into
the
wilderness
with
their
numbers
which
they
had
selected
to
go
up
to
the
land
of
nephi
to
preach
the
word
of
god
unto
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
journeyed
many
days
in
the
wilderness
and
they
fasted
much
and
prayed
much
that
the
lord
would
grant
unto
them
a
portion
of
his
spirit
to
go
with
them
and
abide
with
them
that
they
might
be
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
god
to
bring
if
it
were
possible
their
brethren
the
lamanites
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
to
the
knowledge
of
the
baseness
of
the
traditions
of
their
fathers
which
were
not
correct

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
did
visit
them
with
his
spirit
and
said
unto
them
be
comforted
and
they
were
comforted

and
the
lord
said
unto
them
also
go
forth
among
the
lamanites
thy
brethren
and
establish
my
word
yet
ye
shall
be
patient
in
longsuffering
and
afflictions
that
ye
may
show
forth
good
examples
unto
them
in
me
and
i
will
make
an
instrument
of
thee
in
my
hands
unto
the
salvation
of
many
souls

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
hearts
of
the
sons
of
mosiah
and
also
those
who
were
with
them
took
courage
to
go
forth
unto
the
lamanites
to
declare
unto
them
the
word
of
god

and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
had
arrived
in
the
borders
of
the
land
of
the
lamanites
that
they
separated
themselves
and
departed
one
from
another
trusting
in
the
lord
that
they
should
meet
again
at
the
close
of
their
harvest
for
they
supposed
that
great
was
the
work
which
they
had
undertaken

and
assuredly
it
was
great
for
they
had
undertaken
to
preach
the
word
of
god
to
a
wild
and
a
hardened
and
a
ferocious
people
a
people
who
delighted
in
murdering
the
nephites
and
robbing
and
plundering
them
and
their
hearts
were
set
upon
riches
or
upon
gold
and
silver
and
precious
stones
yet
they
sought
to
obtain
these
things
by
murdering
and
plundering
that
they
might
not
labor
for
them
with
their
own
hands

thus
they
were
a
very
indolent
people
many
of
whom
did
worship
idols
and
the
curse
of
god
had
fallen
upon
them
because
of
the
traditions
of
their
fathers
notwithstanding
the
promises
of
the
lord
were
extended
unto
them
on
the
conditions
of
repentance

therefore
this
was
the
cause
for
which
the
sons
of
mosiah
had
undertaken
the
work
that
perhaps
they
might
bring
them
unto
repentance
that
perhaps
they
might
bring
them
to
know
of
the
plan
of
redemption

therefore
they
separated
themselves
one
from
another
and
went
forth
among
them
every
man
alone
according
to
the
word
and
power
of
god
which
was
given
unto
him

now
ammon
being
the
chief
among
them
or
rather
he
did
administer
unto
them
and
he
departed
from
them
after
having
blessed
them
according
to
their
several
stations
having
imparted
the
word
of
god
unto
them
or
administered
unto
them
before
his
departure
and
thus
they
took
their
several
journeys
throughout
the
land

and
ammon
went
to
the
land
of
ishmael
the
land
being
called
after
the
sons
of
ishmael
who
also
became
lamanites

and
as
ammon
entered
the
land
of
ishmael
the
lamanites
took
him
and
bound
him
as
was
their
custom
to
bind
all
the
nephites
who
fell
into
their
hands
and
carry
them
before
the
king
and
thus
it
was
left
to
the
pleasure
of
the
king
to
slay
them
or
to
retain
them
in
captivity
or
to
cast
them
into
prison
or
to
cast
them
out
of
his
land
according
to
his
will
and
pleasure

and
thus
ammon
was
carried
before
the
king
who
was
over
the
land
of
ishmael
and
his
name
was
lamoni
and
he
was
a
descendant
of
ishmael

and
the
king
inquired
of
ammon
if
it
were
his
desire
to
dwell
in
the
land
among
the
lamanites
or
among
his
people

and
ammon
said
unto
him
yea
i
desire
to
dwell
among
this
people
for
a
time
yea
and
perhaps
until
the
day
i
die

and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
lamoni
was
much
pleased
with
ammon
and
caused
that
his
bands
should
be
loosed
and
he
would
that
ammon
should
take
one
of
his
daughters
to
wife

but
ammon
said
unto
him
nay
but
i
will
be
thy
servant
therefore
ammon
became
a
servant
to
king
lamoni
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
was
set
among
other
servants
to
watch
the
flocks
of
lamoni
according
to
the
custom
of
the
lamanites

and
after
he
had
been
in
the
service
of
the
king
three
days
as
he
was
with
the
lamanitish
servants
going
forth
with
their
flocks
to
the
place
of
water
which
was
called
the
water
of
sebus
and
all
the
lamanites
drive
their
flocks
hither
that
they
may
have
water

therefore
as
ammon
and
the
servants
of
the
king
were
driving
forth
their
flocks
to
this
place
of
water
behold
a
certain
number
of
the
lamanites
who
had
been
with
their
flocks
to
water
stood
and
scattered
the
flocks
of
ammon
and
the
servants
of
the
king
and
they
scattered
them
insomuch
that
they
fled
many
ways

now
the
servants
of
the
king
began
to
murmur
saying
now
the
king
will
slay
us
as
he
has
our
brethren
because
their
flocks
were
scattered
by
the
wickedness
of
these
men
and
they
began
to
weep
exceedingly
saying
behold
our
flocks
are
scattered
already

now
they
wept
because
of
the
fear
of
being
slain
now
when
ammon
saw
this
his
heart
was
swollen
within
him
with
joy
for
said
he
i
will
show
forth
my
power
unto
these
my
fellowservants
or
the
power
which
is
in
me
in
restoring
these
flocks
unto
the
king
that
i
may
win
the
hearts
of
these
my
fellowservants
that
i
may
lead
them
to
believe
in
my
words

and
now
these
were
the
thoughts
of
ammon
when
he
saw
the
afflictions
of
those
whom
he
termed
to
be
his
brethren

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
flattered
them
by
his
words
saying
my
brethren
be
of
good
cheer
and
let
us
go
in
search
of
the
flocks
and
we
will
gather
them
together
and
bring
them
back
unto
the
place
of
water
and
thus
we
will
preserve
the
flocks
unto
the
king
and
he
will
not
slay
us

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
in
search
of
the
flocks
and
they
did
follow
ammon
and
they
rushed
forth
with
much
swiftness
and
did
head
the
flocks
of
the
king
and
did
gather
them
together
again
to
the
place
of
water

and
those
men
again
stood
to
scatter
their
flocks
but
ammon
said
unto
his
brethren
encircle
the
flocks
round
about
that
they
flee
not
and
i
go
and
contend
with
these
men
who
do
scatter
our
flocks

therefore
they
did
as
ammon
commanded
them
and
he
went
forth
and
stood
to
contend
with
those
who
stood
by
the
waters
of
sebus
and
they
were
in
number
not
a
few

therefore
they
did
not
fear
ammon
for
they
supposed
that
one
of
their
men
could
slay
him
according
to
their
pleasure
for
they
knew
not
that
the
lord
had
promised
mosiah
that
he
would
deliver
his
sons
out
of
their
hands
neither
did
they
know
anything
concerning
the
lord
therefore
they
delighted
in
the
destruction
of
their
brethren
and
for
this
cause
they
stood
to
scatter
the
flocks
of
the
king

but
ammon
stood
forth
and
began
to
cast
stones
at
them
with
his
sling
yea
with
mighty
power
he
did
sling
stones
amongst
them
and
thus
he
slew
a
certain
number
of
them
insomuch
that
they
began
to
be
astonished
at
his
power
nevertheless
they
were
angry
because
of
the
slain
of
their
brethren
and
they
were
determined
that
he
should
fall
therefore
seeing
that
they
could
not
hit
him
with
their
stones
they
came
forth
with
clubs
to
slay
him

but
behold
every
man
that
lifted
his
club
to
smite
ammon
he
smote
off
their
arms
with
his
sword
for
he
did
withstand
their
blows
by
smiting
their
arms
with
the
edge
of
his
sword
insomuch
that
they
began
to
be
astonished
and
began
to
flee
before
him
yea
and
they
were
not
few
in
number
and
he
caused
them
to
flee
by
the
strength
of
his
arm

now
six
of
them
had
fallen
by
the
sling
but
he
slew
none
save
it
were
their
leader
with
his
sword
and
he
smote
off
as
many
of
their
arms
as
were
lifted
against
him
and
they
were
not
a
few

and
when
he
had
driven
them
afar
off
he
returned
and
they
watered
their
flocks
and
returned
them
to
the
pasture
of
the
king
and
then
went
in
unto
the
king
bearing
the
arms
which
had
been
smitten
off
by
the
sword
of
ammon
of
those
who
sought
to
slay
him
and
they
were
carried
in
unto
the
king
for
a
testimony
of
the
things
which
they
had
done
alma
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
lamoni
caused
that
his
servants
should
stand
forth
and
testify
to
all
the
things
which
they
had
seen
concerning
the
matter

and
when
they
had
all
testified
to
the
things
which
they
had
seen
and
he
had
learned
of
the
faithfulness
of
ammon
in
preserving
his
flocks
and
also
of
his
great
power
in
contending
against
those
who
sought
to
slay
him
he
was
astonished
exceedingly
and
said
surely
this
is
more
than
a
man
behold
is
not
this
the
great
spirit
who
doth
send
such
great
punishments
upon
this
people
because
of
their
murders

and
they
answered
the
king
and
said
whether
he
be
the
great
spirit
or
a
man
we
know
not
but
this
much
we
do
know
that
he
cannot
be
slain
by
the
enemies
of
the
king
neither
can
they
scatter
the
kings
flocks
when
he
is
with
us
because
of
his
expertness
and
great
strength
therefore
we
know
that
he
is
a
friend
to
the
king
and
now
o
king
we
do
not
believe
that
a
man
has
such
great
power
for
we
know
he
cannot
be
slain

and
now
when
the
king
heard
these
words
he
said
unto
them
now
i
know
that
it
is
the
great
spirit
and
he
has
come
down
at
this
time
to
preserve
your
lives
that
i
might
not
slay
you
as
i
did
your
brethren
now
this
is
the
great
spirit
of
whom
our
fathers
have
spoken

now
this
was
the
tradition
of
lamoni
which
he
had
received
from
his
father
that
there
was
a
great
spirit
notwithstanding
they
believed
in
a
great
spirit
they
supposed
that
whatsoever
they
did
was
right
nevertheless
lamoni
began
to
fear
exceedingly
with
fear
lest
he
had
done
wrong
in
slaying
his
servants

for
he
had
slain
many
of
them
because
their
brethren
had
scattered
their
flocks
at
the
place
of
water
and
thus
because
they
had
had
their
flocks
scattered
they
were
slain

now
it
was
the
practice
of
these
lamanites
to
stand
by
the
waters
of
sebus
to
scatter
the
flocks
of
the
people
that
thereby
they
might
drive
away
many
that
were
scattered
unto
their
own
land
it
being
a
practice
of
plunder
among
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
lamoni
inquired
of
his
servants
saying
where
is
this
man
that
has
such
great
power

and
they
said
unto
him
behold
he
is
feeding
thy
horses
now
the
king
had
commanded
his
servants
previous
to
the
time
of
the
watering
of
their
flocks
that
they
should
prepare
his
horses
and
chariots
and
conduct
him
forth
to
the
land
of
nephi
for
there
had
been
a
great
feast
appointed
at
the
land
of
nephi
by
the
father
of
lamoni
who
was
king
over
all
the
land

now
when
king
lamoni
heard
that
ammon
was
preparing
his
horses
and
his
chariots
he
was
more
astonished
because
of
the
faithfulness
of
ammon
saying
surely
there
has
not
been
any
servant
among
all
my
servants
that
has
been
so
faithful
as
this
man
for
even
he
doth
remember
all
my
commandments
to
execute
them

now
i
surely
know
that
this
is
the
great
spirit
and
i
would
desire
him
that
he
come
in
unto
me
but
i
durst
not

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
ammon
had
made
ready
the
horses
and
the
chariots
for
the
king
and
his
servants
he
went
in
unto
the
king
and
he
saw
that
the
countenance
of
the
king
was
changed
therefore
he
was
about
to
return
out
of
his
presence

and
one
of
the
kings
servants
said
unto
him
rabbanah
which
is
being
interpreted
powerful
or
great
king
considering
their
kings
to
be
powerful
and
thus
he
said
unto
him
rabbanah
the
king
desireth
thee
to
stay

therefore
ammon
turned
himself
unto
the
king
and
said
unto
him
what
wilt
thou
that
i
should
do
for
thee
o
king
and
the
king
answered
him
not
for
the
space
of
an
hour
according
to
their
time
for
he
knew
not
what
he
should
say
unto
him

and
it
came
to
pass
that
ammon
said
unto
him
again
what
desirest
thou
of
me
but
the
king
answered
him
not

and
it
came
to
pass
that
ammon
being
filled
with
the
spirit
of
god
therefore
he
perceived
the
thoughts
of
the
king
and
he
said
unto
him
is
it
because
thou
hast
heard
that
i
defended
thy
servants
and
thy
flocks
and
slew
seven
of
their
brethren
with
the
sling
and
with
the
sword
and
smote
off
the
arms
of
others
in
order
to
defend
thy
flocks
and
thy
servants
behold
is
it
this
that
causeth
thy
marvelings

i
say
unto
you
what
is
it
that
thy
marvelings
are
so
great
behold
i
am
a
man
and
am
thy
servant
therefore
whatsoever
thou
desirest
which
is
right
that
will
i
do

now
when
the
king
had
heard
these
words
he
marveled
again
for
he
beheld
that
ammon
could
discern
his
thoughts
but
notwithstanding
this
king
lamoni
did
open
his
mouth
and
said
unto
him
who
art
thou
art
thou
that
great
spirit
who
knows
all
things

ammon
answered
and
said
unto
him
i
am
not

and
the
king
said
how
knowest
thou
the
thoughts
of
my
heart
thou
mayest
speak
boldly
and
tell
me
concerning
these
things
and
also
tell
me
by
what
power
ye
slew
and
smote
off
the
arms
of
my
brethren
that
scattered
my
flocks

and
now
if
thou
wilt
tell
me
concerning
these
things
whatsoever
thou
desirest
i
will
give
unto
thee
and
if
it
were
needed
i
would
guard
thee
with
my
armies
but
i
know
that
thou
art
more
powerful
than
all
they
nevertheless
whatsoever
thou
desirest
of
me
i
will
grant
it
unto
thee

now
ammon
being
wise
yet
harmless
he
said
unto
lamoni
wilt
thou
hearken
unto
my
words
if
i
tell
thee
by
what
power
i
do
these
things
and
this
is
the
thing
that
i
desire
of
thee

and
the
king
answered
him
and
said
yea
i
will
believe
all
thy
words
and
thus
he
was
caught
with
guile

and
ammon
began
to
speak
unto
him
with
boldness
and
said
unto
him
believest
thou
that
there
is
a
god

and
he
answered
and
said
unto
him
i
do
not
know
what
that
meaneth

and
then
ammon
said
believest
thou
that
there
is
a
great
spirit

and
he
said
yea

and
ammon
said
this
is
god
and
ammon
said
unto
him
again
believest
thou
that
this
great
spirit
who
is
god
created
all
things
which
are
in
heaven
and
in
the
earth

and
he
said
yea
i
believe
that
he
created
all
things
which
are
in
the
earth
but
i
do
not
know
the
heavens

and
ammon
said
unto
him
the
heavens
is
a
place
where
god
dwells
and
all
his
holy
angels

and
king
lamoni
said
is
it
above
the
earth

and
ammon
said
yea
and
he
looketh
down
upon
all
the
children
of
men
and
he
knows
all
the
thoughts
and
intents
of
the
heart
for
by
his
hand
were
they
all
created
from
the
beginning

and
king
lamoni
said
i
believe
all
these
things
which
thou
hast
spoken
art
thou
sent
from
god

ammon
said
unto
him
i
am
a
man
and
man
in
the
beginning
was
created
after
the
image
of
god
and
i
am
called
by
his
holy
spirit
to
teach
these
things
unto
this
people
that
they
may
be
brought
to
a
knowledge
of
that
which
is
just
and
true

and
a
portion
of
that
spirit
dwelleth
in
me
which
giveth
me
knowledge
and
also
power
according
to
my
faith
and
desires
which
are
in
god

now
when
ammon
had
said
these
words
he
began
at
the
creation
of
the
world
and
also
the
creation
of
adam
and
told
him
all
the
things
concerning
the
fall
of
man
and
rehearsed
and
laid
before
him
the
records
and
the
holy
scriptures
of
the
people
which
had
been
spoken
by
the
prophets
even
down
to
the
time
that
their
father
lehi
left
jerusalem

and
he
also
rehearsed
unto
them
for
it
was
unto
the
king
and
to
his
servants
all
the
journeyings
of
their
fathers
in
the
wilderness
and
all
their
sufferings
with
hunger
and
thirst
and
their
travail
and
so
forth

and
he
also
rehearsed
unto
them
concerning
the
rebellions
of
laman
and
lemuel
and
the
sons
of
ishmael
yea
all
their
rebellions
did
he
relate
unto
them
and
he
expounded
unto
them
all
the
records
and
scriptures
from
the
time
that
lehi
left
jerusalem
down
to
the
present
time

but
this
is
not
all
for
he
expounded
unto
them
the
plan
of
redemption
which
was
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
and
he
also
made
known
unto
them
concerning
the
coming
of
christ
and
all
the
works
of
the
lord
did
he
make
known
unto
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
he
had
said
all
these
things
and
expounded
them
to
the
king
that
the
king
believed
all
his
words

and
he
began
to
cry
unto
the
lord
saying
o
lord
have
mercy
according
to
thy
abundant
mercy
which
thou
hast
had
upon
the
people
of
nephi
have
upon
me
and
my
people

and
now
when
he
had
said
this
he
fell
unto
the
earth
as
if
he
were
dead

and
it
came
to
pass
that
his
servants
took
him
and
carried
him
in
unto
his
wife
and
laid
him
upon
a
bed
and
he
lay
as
if
he
were
dead
for
the
space
of
two
days
and
two
nights
and
his
wife
and
his
sons
and
his
daughters
mourned
over
him
after
the
manner
of
the
lamanites
greatly
lamenting
his
loss
alma
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
two
days
and
two
nights
they
were
about
to
take
his
body
and
lay
it
in
a
sepulchre
which
they
had
made
for
the
purpose
of
burying
their
dead

now
the
queen
having
heard
of
the
fame
of
ammon
therefore
she
sent
and
desired
that
he
should
come
in
unto
her

and
it
came
to
pass
that
ammon
did
as
he
was
commanded
and
went
in
unto
the
queen
and
desired
to
know
what
she
would
that
he
should
do

and
she
said
unto
him
the
servants
of
my
husband
have
made
it
known
unto
me
that
thou
art
a
prophet
of
a
holy
god
and
that
thou
hast
power
to
do
many
mighty
works
in
his
name

therefore
if
this
is
the
case
i
would
that
ye
should
go
in
and
see
my
husband
for
he
has
been
laid
upon
his
bed
for
the
space
of
two
days
and
two
nights
and
some
say
that
he
is
not
dead
but
others
say
that
he
is
dead
and
that
he
stinketh
and
that
he
ought
to
be
placed
in
the
sepulchre
but
as
for
myself
to
me
he
doth
not
stink

now
this
was
what
ammon
desired
for
he
knew
that
king
lamoni
was
under
the
power
of
god
he
knew
that
the
dark
veil
of
unbelief
was
being
cast
away
from
his
mind
and
the
light
which
did
light
up
his
mind
which
was
the
light
of
the
glory
of
god
which
was
a
marvelous
light
of
his
goodnessyea
this
light
had
infused
such
joy
into
his
soul
the
cloud
of
darkness
having
been
dispelled
and
that
the
light
of
everlasting
life
was
lit
up
in
his
soul
yea
he
knew
that
this
had
overcome
his
natural
frame
and
he
was
carried
away
in
god

therefore
what
the
queen
desired
of
him
was
his
only
desire
therefore
he
went
in
to
see
the
king
according
as
the
queen
had
desired
him
and
he
saw
the
king
and
he
knew
that
he
was
not
dead

and
he
said
unto
the
queen
he
is
not
dead
but
he
sleepeth
in
god
and
on
the
morrow
he
shall
rise
again
therefore
bury
him
not

and
ammon
said
unto
her
believest
thou
this
and
she
said
unto
him
i
have
had
no
witness
save
thy
word
and
the
word
of
our
servants
nevertheless
i
believe
that
it
shall
be
according
as
thou
hast
said

and
ammon
said
unto
her
blessed
art
thou
because
of
thy
exceeding
faith
i
say
unto
thee
woman
there
has
not
been
such
great
faith
among
all
the
people
of
the
nephites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
she
watched
over
the
bed
of
her
husband
from
that
time
even
until
that
time
on
the
morrow
which
ammon
had
appointed
that
he
should
rise

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
arose
according
to
the
words
of
ammon
and
as
he
arose
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
unto
the
woman
and
said
blessed
be
the
name
of
god
and
blessed
art
thou

for
as
sure
as
thou
livest
behold
i
have
seen
my
redeemer
and
he
shall
come
forth
and
be
born
of
a
woman
and
he
shall
redeem
all
mankind
who
believe
on
his
name
now
when
he
had
said
these
words
his
heart
was
swollen
within
him
and
he
sunk
again
with
joy
and
the
queen
also
sunk
down
being
overpowered
by
the
spirit

now
ammon
seeing
the
spirit
of
the
lord
poured
out
according
to
his
prayers
upon
the
lamanites
his
brethren
who
had
been
the
cause
of
so
much
mourning
among
the
nephites
or
among
all
the
people
of
god
because
of
their
iniquities
and
their
traditions
he
fell
upon
his
knees
and
began
to
pour
out
his
soul
in
prayer
and
thanksgiving
to
god
for
what
he
had
done
for
his
brethren
and
he
was
also
overpowered
with
joy
and
thus
they
all
three
had
sunk
to
the
earth

now
when
the
servants
of
the
king
had
seen
that
they
had
fallen
they
also
began
to
cry
unto
god
for
the
fear
of
the
lord
had
come
upon
them
also
for
it
was
they
who
had
stood
before
the
king
and
testified
unto
him
concerning
the
great
power
of
ammon

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
call
on
the
name
of
the
lord
in
their
might
even
until
they
had
all
fallen
to
the
earth
save
it
were
one
of
the
lamanitish
women
whose
name
was
abish
she
having
been
converted
unto
the
lord
for
many
years
on
account
of
a
remarkable
vision
of
her
father

thus
having
been
converted
to
the
lord
and
never
having
made
it
known
therefore
when
she
saw
that
all
the
servants
of
lamoni
had
fallen
to
the
earth
and
also
her
mistress
the
queen
and
the
king
and
ammon
lay
prostrate
upon
the
earth
she
knew
that
it
was
the
power
of
god
and
supposing
that
this
opportunity
by
making
known
unto
the
people
what
had
happened
among
them
that
by
beholding
this
scene
it
would
cause
them
to
believe
in
the
power
of
god
therefore
she
ran
forth
from
house
to
house
making
it
known
unto
the
people

and
they
began
to
assemble
themselves
together
unto
the
house
of
the
king
and
there
came
a
multitude
and
to
their
astonishment
they
beheld
the
king
and
the
queen
and
their
servants
prostrate
upon
the
earth
and
they
all
lay
there
as
though
they
were
dead
and
they
also
saw
ammon
and
behold
he
was
a
nephite

and
now
the
people
began
to
murmur
among
themselves
some
saying
that
it
was
a
great
evil
that
had
come
upon
them
or
upon
the
king
and
his
house
because
he
had
suffered
that
the
nephite
should
remain
in
the
land

but
others
rebuked
them
saying
the
king
hath
brought
this
evil
upon
his
house
because
he
slew
his
servants
who
had
had
their
flocks
scattered
at
the
waters
of
sebus

and
they
were
also
rebuked
by
those
men
who
had
stood
at
the
waters
of
sebus
and
scattered
the
flocks
which
belonged
to
the
king
for
they
were
angry
with
ammon
because
of
the
number
which
he
had
slain
of
their
brethren
at
the
waters
of
sebus
while
defending
the
flocks
of
the
king

now
one
of
them
whose
brother
had
been
slain
with
the
sword
of
ammon
being
exceedingly
angry
with
ammon
drew
his
sword
and
went
forth
that
he
might
let
it
fall
upon
ammon
to
slay
him
and
as
he
lifted
the
sword
to
smite
him
behold
he
fell
dead

now
we
see
that
ammon
could
not
be
slain
for
the
lord
had
said
unto
mosiah
his
father
i
will
spare
him
and
it
shall
be
unto
him
according
to
thy
faiththerefore
mosiah
trusted
him
unto
the
lord

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
multitude
beheld
that
the
man
had
fallen
dead
who
lifted
the
sword
to
slay
ammon
fear
came
upon
them
all
and
they
durst
not
put
forth
their
hands
to
touch
him
or
any
of
those
who
had
fallen
and
they
began
to
marvel
again
among
themselves
what
could
be
the
cause
of
this
great
power
or
what
all
these
things
could
mean

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
among
them
who
said
that
ammon
was
the
great
spirit
and
others
said
he
was
sent
by
the
great
spirit

but
others
rebuked
them
all
saying
that
he
was
a
monster
who
had
been
sent
from
the
nephites
to
torment
them

and
there
were
some
who
said
that
ammon
was
sent
by
the
great
spirit
to
afflict
them
because
of
their
iniquities
and
that
it
was
the
great
spirit
that
had
always
attended
the
nephites
who
had
ever
delivered
them
out
of
their
hands
and
they
said
that
it
was
this
great
spirit
who
had
destroyed
so
many
of
their
brethren
the
lamanites

and
thus
the
contention
began
to
be
exceedingly
sharp
among
them
and
while
they
were
thus
contending
the
woman
servant
who
had
caused
the
multitude
to
be
gathered
together
came
and
when
she
saw
the
contention
which
was
among
the
multitude
she
was
exceedingly
sorrowful
even
unto
tears

and
it
came
to
pass
that
she
went
and
took
the
queen
by
the
hand
that
perhaps
she
might
raise
her
from
the
ground
and
as
soon
as
she
touched
her
hand
she
arose
and
stood
upon
her
feet
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
saying
o
blessed
jesus
who
has
saved
me
from
an
awful
hell
o
blessed
god
have
mercy
on
this
people

and
when
she
had
said
this
she
clasped
her
hands
being
filled
with
joy
speaking
many
words
which
were
not
understood
and
when
she
had
done
this
she
took
the
king
lamoni
by
the
hand
and
behold
he
arose
and
stood
upon
his
feet

and
he
immediately
seeing
the
contention
among
his
people
went
forth
and
began
to
rebuke
them
and
to
teach
them
the
words
which
he
had
heard
from
the
mouth
of
ammon
and
as
many
as
heard
his
words
believed
and
were
converted
unto
the
lord

but
there
were
many
among
them
who
would
not
hear
his
words
therefore
they
went
their
way

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
ammon
arose
he
also
administered
unto
them
and
also
did
all
the
servants
of
lamoni
and
they
did
all
declare
unto
the
people
the
selfsame
thingthat
their
hearts
had
been
changed
that
they
had
no
more
desire
to
do
evil

and
behold
many
did
declare
unto
the
people
that
they
had
seen
angels
and
had
conversed
with
them
and
thus
they
had
told
them
things
of
god
and
of
his
righteousness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
that
did
believe
in
their
words
and
as
many
as
did
believe
were
baptized
and
they
became
a
righteous
people
and
they
did
establish
a
church
among
them

and
thus
the
work
of
the
lord
did
commence
among
the
lamanites
thus
the
lord
did
begin
to
pour
out
his
spirit
upon
them
and
we
see
that
his
arm
is
extended
to
all
people
who
will
repent
and
believe
on
his
name
alma
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
established
a
church
in
that
land
that
king
lamoni
desired
that
ammon
should
go
with
him
to
the
land
of
nephi
that
he
might
show
him
unto
his
father

and
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
to
ammon
saying
thou
shalt
not
go
up
to
the
land
of
nephi
for
behold
the
king
will
seek
thy
life
but
thou
shalt
go
to
the
land
of
middoni
for
behold
thy
brother
aaron
and
also
muloki
and
ammah
are
in
prison

now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
ammon
had
heard
this
he
said
unto
lamoni
behold
my
brother
and
brethren
are
in
prison
at
middoni
and
i
go
that
i
may
deliver
them

now
lamoni
said
unto
ammon
i
know
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
thou
canst
do
all
things
but
behold
i
will
go
with
thee
to
the
land
of
middoni
for
the
king
of
the
land
of
middoni
whose
name
is
antiomno
is
a
friend
unto
me
therefore
i
go
to
the
land
of
middoni
that
i
may
flatter
the
king
of
the
land
and
he
will
cast
thy
brethren
out
of
prison
now
lamoni
said
unto
him
who
told
thee
that
thy
brethren
were
in
prison

and
ammon
said
unto
him
no
one
hath
told
me
save
it
be
god
and
he
said
unto
mego
and
deliver
thy
brethren
for
they
are
in
prison
in
the
land
of
middoni

now
when
lamoni
had
heard
this
he
caused
that
his
servants
should
make
ready
his
horses
and
his
chariots

and
he
said
unto
ammon
come
i
will
go
with
thee
down
to
the
land
of
middoni
and
there
i
will
plead
with
the
king
that
he
will
cast
thy
brethren
out
of
prison

and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
ammon
and
lamoni
were
journeying
thither
they
met
the
father
of
lamoni
who
was
king
over
all
the
land

and
behold
the
father
of
lamoni
said
unto
him
why
did
ye
not
come
to
the
feast
on
that
great
day
when
i
made
a
feast
unto
my
sons
and
unto
my
people

and
he
also
said
whither
art
thou
going
with
this
nephite
who
is
one
of
the
children
of
a
liar

and
it
came
to
pass
that
lamoni
rehearsed
unto
him
whither
he
was
going
for
he
feared
to
offend
him

and
he
also
told
him
all
the
cause
of
his
tarrying
in
his
own
kingdom
that
he
did
not
go
unto
his
father
to
the
feast
which
he
had
prepared

and
now
when
lamoni
had
rehearsed
unto
him
all
these
things
behold
to
his
astonishment
his
father
was
angry
with
him
and
said
lamoni
thou
art
going
to
deliver
these
nephites
who
are
sons
of
a
liar
behold
he
robbed
our
fathers
and
now
his
children
are
also
come
amongst
us
that
they
may
by
their
cunning
and
their
lyings
deceive
us
that
they
again
may
rob
us
of
our
property

now
the
father
of
lamoni
commanded
him
that
he
should
slay
ammon
with
the
sword
and
he
also
commanded
him
that
he
should
not
go
to
the
land
of
middoni
but
that
he
should
return
with
him
to
the
land
of
ishmael

but
lamoni
said
unto
him
i
will
not
slay
ammon
neither
will
i
return
to
the
land
of
ishmael
but
i
go
to
the
land
of
middoni
that
i
may
release
the
brethren
of
ammon
for
i
know
that
they
are
just
men
and
holy
prophets
of
the
true
god

now
when
his
father
had
heard
these
words
he
was
angry
with
him
and
he
drew
his
sword
that
he
might
smite
him
to
the
earth

but
ammon
stood
forth
and
said
unto
him
behold
thou
shalt
not
slay
thy
son
nevertheless
it
were
better
that
he
should
fall
than
thee
for
behold
he
has
repented
of
his
sins
but
if
thou
shouldst
fall
at
this
time
in
thine
anger
thy
soul
could
not
be
saved

and
again
it
is
expedient
that
thou
shouldst
forbear
for
if
thou
shouldst
slay
thy
son
he
being
an
innocent
man
his
blood
would
cry
from
the
ground
to
the
lord
his
god
for
vengeance
to
come
upon
thee
and
perhaps
thou
wouldst
lose
thy
soul

now
when
ammon
had
said
these
words
unto
him
he
answered
him
saying
i
know
that
if
i
should
slay
my
son
that
i
should
shed
innocent
blood
for
it
is
thou
that
hast
sought
to
destroy
him

and
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
to
slay
ammon
but
ammon
withstood
his
blows
and
also
smote
his
arm
that
he
could
not
use
it

now
when
the
king
saw
that
ammon
could
slay
him
he
began
to
plead
with
ammon
that
he
would
spare
his
life

but
ammon
raised
his
sword
and
said
unto
him
behold
i
will
smite
thee
except
thou
wilt
grant
unto
me
that
my
brethren
may
be
cast
out
of
prison

now
the
king
fearing
he
should
lose
his
life
said
if
thou
wilt
spare
me
i
will
grant
unto
thee
whatsoever
thou
wilt
ask
even
to
half
of
the
kingdom

now
when
ammon
saw
that
he
had
wrought
upon
the
old
king
according
to
his
desire
he
said
unto
him
if
thou
wilt
grant
that
my
brethren
may
be
cast
out
of
prison
and
also
that
lamoni
may
retain
his
kingdom
and
that
ye
be
not
displeased
with
him
but
grant
that
he
may
do
according
to
his
own
desires
in
whatsoever
thing
he
thinketh
then
will
i
spare
thee
otherwise
i
will
smite
thee
to
the
earth

now
when
ammon
had
said
these
words
the
king
began
to
rejoice
because
of
his
life

and
when
he
saw
that
ammon
had
no
desire
to
destroy
him
and
when
he
also
saw
the
great
love
he
had
for
his
son
lamoni
he
was
astonished
exceedingly
and
said
because
this
is
all
that
thou
hast
desired
that
i
would
release
thy
brethren
and
suffer
that
my
son
lamoni
should
retain
his
kingdom
behold
i
will
grant
unto
you
that
my
son
may
retain
his
kingdom
from
this
time
and
forever
and
i
will
govern
him
no
more

and
i
will
also
grant
unto
thee
that
thy
brethren
may
be
cast
out
of
prison
and
thou
and
thy
brethren
may
come
unto
me
in
my
kingdom
for
i
shall
greatly
desire
to
see
thee
for
the
king
was
greatly
astonished
at
the
words
which
he
had
spoken
and
also
at
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
by
his
son
lamoni
therefore
he
was
desirous
to
learn
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
ammon
and
lamoni
proceeded
on
their
journey
towards
the
land
of
middoni
and
lamoni
found
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
king
of
the
land
therefore
the
brethren
of
ammon
were
brought
forth
out
of
prison

and
when
ammon
did
meet
them
he
was
exceedingly
sorrowful
for
behold
they
were
naked
and
their
skins
were
worn
exceedingly
because
of
being
bound
with
strong
cords
and
they
also
had
suffered
hunger
thirst
and
all
kinds
of
afflictions
nevertheless
they
were
patient
in
all
their
sufferings

and
as
it
happened
it
was
their
lot
to
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
more
hardened
and
a
more
stiffnecked
people
therefore
they
would
not
hearken
unto
their
words
and
they
had
cast
them
out
and
had
smitten
them
and
had
driven
them
from
house
to
house
and
from
place
to
place
even
until
they
had
arrived
in
the
land
of
middoni
and
there
they
were
taken
and
cast
into
prison
and
bound
with
strong
cords
and
kept
in
prison
for
many
days
and
were
delivered
by
lamoni
and
ammon
alma
chapter


now
when
ammon
and
his
brethren
separated
themselves
in
the
borders
of
the
land
of
the
lamanites
behold
aaron
took
his
journey
towards
the
land
which
was
called
by
the
lamanites
jerusalem
calling
it
after
the
land
of
their
fathers
nativity
and
it
was
away
joining
the
borders
of
mormon

now
the
lamanites
and
the
amalekites
and
the
people
of
amulon
had
built
a
great
city
which
was
called
jerusalem

now
the
lamanites
of
themselves
were
sufficiently
hardened
but
the
amalekites
and
the
amulonites
were
still
harder
therefore
they
did
cause
the
lamanites
that
they
should
harden
their
hearts
that
they
should
wax
strong
in
wickedness
and
their
abominations

and
it
came
to
pass
that
aaron
came
to
the
city
of
jerusalem
and
first
began
to
preach
to
the
amalekites
and
he
began
to
preach
to
them
in
their
synagogues
for
they
had
built
synagogues
after
the
order
of
the
nehors
for
many
of
the
amalekites
and
the
amulonites
were
after
the
order
of
the
nehors

therefore
as
aaron
entered
into
one
of
their
synagogues
to
preach
unto
the
people
and
as
he
was
speaking
unto
them
behold
there
arose
an
amalekite
and
began
to
contend
with
him
saying
what
is
that
thou
hast
testified
hast
thou
seen
an
angel
why
do
not
angels
appear
unto
us
behold
are
not
this
people
as
good
as
thy
people

thou
also
sayest
except
we
repent
we
shall
perish
how
knowest
thou
the
thought
and
intent
of
our
hearts
how
knowest
thou
that
we
have
cause
to
repent
how
knowest
thou
that
we
are
not
a
righteous
people
behold
we
have
built
sanctuaries
and
we
do
assemble
ourselves
together
to
worship
god
we
do
believe
that
god
will
save
all
men

now
aaron
said
unto
him
believest
thou
that
the
son
of
god
shall
come
to
redeem
mankind
from
their
sins

and
the
man
said
unto
him
we
do
not
believe
that
thou
knowest
any
such
thing
we
do
not
believe
in
these
foolish
traditions
we
do
not
believe
that
thou
knowest
of
things
to
come
neither
do
we
believe
that
thy
fathers
and
also
that
our
fathers
did
know
concerning
the
things
which
they
spake
of
that
which
is
to
come

now
aaron
began
to
open
the
scriptures
unto
them
concerning
the
coming
of
christ
and
also
concerning
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
that
there
could
be
no
redemption
for
mankind
save
it
were
through
the
death
and
sufferings
of
christ
and
the
atonement
of
his
blood

and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
began
to
expound
these
things
unto
them
they
were
angry
with
him
and
began
to
mock
him
and
they
would
not
hear
the
words
which
he
spake

therefore
when
he
saw
that
they
would
not
hear
his
words
he
departed
out
of
their
synagogue
and
came
over
to
a
village
which
was
called
anianti
and
there
he
found
muloki
preaching
the
word
unto
them
and
also
ammah
and
his
brethren
and
they
contended
with
many
about
the
word

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
saw
that
the
people
would
harden
their
hearts
therefore
they
departed
and
came
over
into
the
land
of
middoni
and
they
did
preach
the
word
unto
many
and
few
believed
on
the
words
which
they
taught

nevertheless
aaron
and
a
certain
number
of
his
brethren
were
taken
and
cast
into
prison
and
the
remainder
of
them
fled
out
of
the
land
of
middoni
unto
the
regions
round
about

and
those
who
were
cast
into
prison
suffered
many
things
and
they
were
delivered
by
the
hand
of
lamoni
and
ammon
and
they
were
fed
and
clothed

and
they
went
forth
again
to
declare
the
word
and
thus
they
were
delivered
for
the
first
time
out
of
prison
and
thus
they
had
suffered

and
they
went
forth
whithersoever
they
were
led
by
the
spirit
of
the
lord
preaching
the
word
of
god
in
every
synagogue
of
the
amalekites
or
in
every
assembly
of
the
lamanites
where
they
could
be
admitted

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
began
to
bless
them
insomuch
that
they
brought
many
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
yea
they
did
convince
many
of
their
sins
and
of
the
traditions
of
their
fathers
which
were
not
correct

and
it
came
to
pass
that
ammon
and
lamoni
returned
from
the
land
of
middoni
to
the
land
of
ishmael
which
was
the
land
of
their
inheritance

and
king
lamoni
would
not
suffer
that
ammon
should
serve
him
or
be
his
servant

but
he
caused
that
there
should
be
synagogues
built
in
the
land
of
ishmael
and
he
caused
that
his
people
or
the
people
who
were
under
his
reign
should
assemble
themselves
together

and
he
did
rejoice
over
them
and
he
did
teach
them
many
things
and
he
did
also
declare
unto
them
that
they
were
a
people
who
were
under
him
and
that
they
were
a
free
people
that
they
were
free
from
the
oppressions
of
the
king
his
father
for
that
his
father
had
granted
unto
him
that
he
might
reign
over
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
of
ishmael
and
in
all
the
land
round
about

and
he
also
declared
unto
them
that
they
might
have
the
liberty
of
worshiping
the
lord
their
god
according
to
their
desires
in
whatsoever
place
they
were
in
if
it
were
in
the
land
which
was
under
the
reign
of
king
lamoni

and
ammon
did
preach
unto
the
people
of
king
lamoni
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
teach
them
all
things
concerning
things
pertaining
to
righteousness
and
he
did
exhort
them
daily
with
all
diligence
and
they
gave
heed
unto
his
word
and
they
were
zealous
for
keeping
the
commandments
of
god
alma
chapter


now
as
ammon
was
thus
teaching
the
people
of
lamoni
continually
we
will
return
to
the
account
of
aaron
and
his
brethren
for
after
he
departed
from
the
land
of
middoni
he
was
led
by
the
spirit
to
the
land
of
nephi
even
to
the
house
of
the
king
which
was
over
all
the
land
save
it
were
the
land
of
ishmael
and
he
was
the
father
of
lamoni

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
went
in
unto
him
into
the
kings
palace
with
his
brethren
and
bowed
himself
before
the
king
and
said
unto
him
behold
o
king
we
are
the
brethren
of
ammon
whom
thou
hast
delivered
out
of
prison

and
now
o
king
if
thou
wilt
spare
our
lives
we
will
be
thy
servants
and
the
king
said
unto
them
arise
for
i
will
grant
unto
you
your
lives
and
i
will
not
suffer
that
ye
shall
be
my
servants
but
i
will
insist
that
ye
shall
administer
unto
me
for
i
have
been
somewhat
troubled
in
mind
because
of
the
generosity
and
the
greatness
of
the
words
of
thy
brother
ammon
and
i
desire
to
know
the
cause
why
he
has
not
come
up
out
of
middoni
with
thee

and
aaron
said
unto
the
king
behold
the
spirit
of
the
lord
has
called
him
another
way
he
has
gone
to
the
land
of
ishmael
to
teach
the
people
of
lamoni

now
the
king
said
unto
them
what
is
this
that
ye
have
said
concerning
the
spirit
of
the
lord
behold
this
is
the
thing
which
doth
trouble
me

and
also
what
is
this
that
ammon
saidif
ye
will
repent
ye
shall
be
saved
and
if
ye
will
not
repent
ye
shall
be
cast
off
at
the
last
day

and
aaron
answered
him
and
said
unto
him
believest
thou
that
there
is
a
god
and
the
king
said
i
know
that
the
amalekites
say
that
there
is
a
god
and
i
have
granted
unto
them
that
they
should
build
sanctuaries
that
they
may
assemble
themselves
together
to
worship
him
and
if
now
thou
sayest
there
is
a
god
behold
i
will
believe

and
now
when
aaron
heard
this
his
heart
began
to
rejoice
and
he
said
behold
assuredly
as
thou
livest
o
king
there
is
a
god

and
the
king
said
is
god
that
great
spirit
that
brought
our
fathers
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem

and
aaron
said
unto
him
yea
he
is
that
great
spirit
and
he
created
all
things
both
in
heaven
and
in
earth
believest
thou
this

and
he
said
yea
i
believe
that
the
great
spirit
created
all
things
and
i
desire
that
ye
should
tell
me
concerning
all
these
things
and
i
will
believe
thy
words

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
aaron
saw
that
the
king
would
believe
his
words
he
began
from
the
creation
of
adam
reading
the
scriptures
unto
the
kinghow
god
created
man
after
his
own
image
and
that
god
gave
him
commandments
and
that
because
of
transgression
man
had
fallen

and
aaron
did
expound
unto
him
the
scriptures
from
the
creation
of
adam
laying
the
fall
of
man
before
him
and
their
carnal
state
and
also
the
plan
of
redemption
which
was
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
through
christ
for
all
whosoever
would
believe
on
his
name

and
since
man
had
fallen
he
could
not
merit
anything
of
himself
but
the
sufferings
and
death
of
christ
atone
for
their
sins
through
faith
and
repentance
and
so
forth
and
that
he
breaketh
the
bands
of
death
that
the
grave
shall
have
no
victory
and
that
the
sting
of
death
should
be
swallowed
up
in
the
hopes
of
glory
and
aaron
did
expound
all
these
things
unto
the
king

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
aaron
had
expounded
these
things
unto
him
the
king
said
what
shall
i
do
that
i
may
have
this
eternal
life
of
which
thou
hast
spoken
yea
what
shall
i
do
that
i
may
be
born
of
god
having
this
wicked
spirit
rooted
out
of
my
breast
and
receive
his
spirit
that
i
may
be
filled
with
joy
that
i
may
not
be
cast
off
at
the
last
day
behold
said
he
i
will
give
up
all
that
i
possess
yea
i
will
forsake
my
kingdom
that
i
may
receive
this
great
joy

but
aaron
said
unto
him
if
thou
desirest
this
thing
if
thou
wilt
bow
down
before
god
yea
if
thou
wilt
repent
of
all
thy
sins
and
will
bow
down
before
god
and
call
on
his
name
in
faith
believing
that
ye
shall
receive
then
shalt
thou
receive
the
hope
which
thou
desirest

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
aaron
had
said
these
words
the
king
did
bow
down
before
the
lord
upon
his
knees
yea
even
he
did
prostrate
himself
upon
the
earth
and
cried
mightily
saying

o
god
aaron
hath
told
me
that
there
is
a
god
and
if
there
is
a
god
and
if
thou
art
god
wilt
thou
make
thyself
known
unto
me
and
i
will
give
away
all
my
sins
to
know
thee
and
that
i
may
be
raised
from
the
dead
and
be
saved
at
the
last
day
and
now
when
the
king
had
said
these
words
he
was
struck
as
if
he
were
dead

and
it
came
to
pass
that
his
servants
ran
and
told
the
queen
all
that
had
happened
unto
the
king
and
she
came
in
unto
the
king
and
when
she
saw
him
lay
as
if
he
were
dead
and
also
aaron
and
his
brethren
standing
as
though
they
had
been
the
cause
of
his
fall
she
was
angry
with
them
and
commanded
that
her
servants
or
the
servants
of
the
king
should
take
them
and
slay
them

now
the
servants
had
seen
the
cause
of
the
kings
fall
therefore
they
durst
not
lay
their
hands
on
aaron
and
his
brethren
and
they
pled
with
the
queen
saying
why
commandest
thou
that
we
should
slay
these
men
when
behold
one
of
them
is
mightier
than
us
all
therefore
we
shall
fall
before
them

now
when
the
queen
saw
the
fear
of
the
servants
she
also
began
to
fear
exceedingly
lest
there
should
some
evil
come
upon
her
and
she
commanded
her
servants
that
they
should
go
and
call
the
people
that
they
might
slay
aaron
and
his
brethren

now
when
aaron
saw
the
determination
of
the
queen
he
also
knowing
the
hardness
of
the
hearts
of
the
people
feared
lest
that
a
multitude
should
assemble
themselves
together
and
there
should
be
a
great
contention
and
a
disturbance
among
them
therefore
he
put
forth
his
hand
and
raised
the
king
from
the
earth
and
said
unto
him
stand
and
he
stood
upon
his
feet
receiving
his
strength

now
this
was
done
in
the
presence
of
the
queen
and
many
of
the
servants
and
when
they
saw
it
they
greatly
marveled
and
began
to
fear
and
the
king
stood
forth
and
began
to
minister
unto
them
and
he
did
minister
unto
them
insomuch
that
his
whole
household
were
converted
unto
the
lord

now
there
was
a
multitude
gathered
together
because
of
the
commandment
of
the
queen
and
there
began
to
be
great
murmurings
among
them
because
of
aaron
and
his
brethren

but
the
king
stood
forth
among
them
and
administered
unto
them
and
they
were
pacified
towards
aaron
and
those
who
were
with
him

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
king
saw
that
the
people
were
pacified
he
caused
that
aaron
and
his
brethren
should
stand
forth
in
the
midst
of
the
multitude
and
that
they
should
preach
the
word
unto
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
sent
a
proclamation
throughout
all
the
land
amongst
all
his
people
who
were
in
all
his
land
who
were
in
all
the
regions
round
about
which
was
bordering
even
to
the
sea
on
the
east
and
on
the
west
and
which
was
divided
from
the
land
of
zarahemla
by
a
narrow
strip
of
wilderness
which
ran
from
the
sea
east
even
to
the
sea
west
and
round
about
on
the
borders
of
the
seashore
and
the
borders
of
the
wilderness
which
was
on
the
north
by
the
land
of
zarahemla
through
the
borders
of
manti
by
the
head
of
the
river
sidon
running
from
the
east
towards
the
westand
thus
were
the
lamanites
and
the
nephites
divided

now
the
more
idle
part
of
the
lamanites
lived
in
the
wilderness
and
dwelt
in
tents
and
they
were
spread
through
the
wilderness
on
the
west
in
the
land
of
nephi
yea
and
also
on
the
west
of
the
land
of
zarahemla
in
the
borders
by
the
seashore
and
on
the
west
in
the
land
of
nephi
in
the
place
of
their
fathers
first
inheritance
and
thus
bordering
along
by
the
seashore

and
also
there
were
many
lamanites
on
the
east
by
the
seashore
whither
the
nephites
had
driven
them
and
thus
the
nephites
were
nearly
surrounded
by
the
lamanites
nevertheless
the
nephites
had
taken
possession
of
all
the
northern
parts
of
the
land
bordering
on
the
wilderness
at
the
head
of
the
river
sidon
from
the
east
to
the
west
round
about
on
the
wilderness
side
on
the
north
even
until
they
came
to
the
land
which
they
called
bountiful

and
it
bordered
upon
the
land
which
they
called
desolation
it
being
so
far
northward
that
it
came
into
the
land
which
had
been
peopled
and
been
destroyed
of
whose
bones
we
have
spoken
which
was
discovered
by
the
people
of
zarahemla
it
being
the
place
of
their
first
landing

and
they
came
from
there
up
into
the
south
wilderness
thus
the
land
on
the
northward
was
called
desolation
and
the
land
on
the
southward
was
called
bountiful
it
being
the
wilderness
which
is
filled
with
all
manner
of
wild
animals
of
every
kind
a
part
of
which
had
come
from
the
land
northward
for
food

and
now
it
was
only
the
distance
of
a
day
and
a
halfs
journey
for
a
nephite
on
the
line
bountiful
and
the
land
desolation
from
the
east
to
the
west
sea
and
thus
the
land
of
nephi
and
the
land
of
zarahemla
were
nearly
surrounded
by
water
there
being
a
small
neck
of
land
between
the
land
northward
and
the
land
southward

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
nephites
had
inhabited
the
land
bountiful
even
from
the
east
unto
the
west
sea
and
thus
the
nephites
in
their
wisdom
with
their
guards
and
their
armies
had
hemmed
in
the
lamanites
on
the
south
that
thereby
they
should
have
no
more
possession
on
the
north
that
they
might
not
overrun
the
land
northward

therefore
the
lamanites
could
have
no
more
possessions
only
in
the
land
of
nephi
and
the
wilderness
round
about
now
this
was
wisdom
in
the
nephitesas
the
lamanites
were
an
enemy
to
them
they
would
not
suffer
their
afflictions
on
every
hand
and
also
that
they
might
have
a
country
whither
they
might
flee
according
to
their
desires

and
now
i
after
having
said
this
return
again
to
the
account
of
ammon
and
aaron
omner
and
himni
and
their
brethren
alma
chapter


behold
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
of
the
lamanites
sent
a
proclamation
among
all
his
people
that
they
should
not
lay
their
hands
on
ammon
or
aaron
or
omner
or
himni
nor
either
of
their
brethren
who
should
go
forth
preaching
the
word
of
god
in
whatsoever
place
they
should
be
in
any
part
of
their
land

yea
he
sent
a
decree
among
them
that
they
should
not
lay
their
hands
on
them
to
bind
them
or
to
cast
them
into
prison
neither
should
they
spit
upon
them
nor
smite
them
nor
cast
them
out
of
their
synagogues
nor
scourge
them
neither
should
they
cast
stones
at
them
but
that
they
should
have
free
access
to
their
houses
and
also
their
temples
and
their
sanctuaries

and
thus
they
might
go
forth
and
preach
the
word
according
to
their
desires
for
the
king
had
been
converted
unto
the
lord
and
all
his
household
therefore
he
sent
his
proclamation
throughout
the
land
unto
his
people
that
the
word
of
god
might
have
no
obstruction
but
that
it
might
go
forth
throughout
all
the
land
that
his
people
might
be
convinced
concerning
the
wicked
traditions
of
their
fathers
and
that
they
might
be
convinced
that
they
were
all
brethren
and
that
they
ought
not
to
murder
nor
to
plunder
nor
to
steal
nor
to
commit
adultery
nor
to
commit
any
manner
of
wickedness

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
king
had
sent
forth
this
proclamation
that
aaron
and
his
brethren
went
forth
from
city
to
city
and
from
one
house
of
worship
to
another
establishing
churches
and
consecrating
priests
and
teachers
throughout
the
land
among
the
lamanites
to
preach
and
to
teach
the
word
of
god
among
them
and
thus
they
began
to
have
great
success

and
thousands
were
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
yea
thousands
were
brought
to
believe
in
the
traditions
of
the
nephites
and
they
were
taught
the
records
and
prophecies
which
were
handed
down
even
to
the
present
time

and
as
sure
as
the
lord
liveth
so
sure
as
many
as
believed
or
as
many
as
were
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
through
the
preaching
of
ammon
and
his
brethren
according
to
the
spirit
of
revelation
and
of
prophecy
and
the
power
of
god
working
miracles
in
themyea
i
say
unto
you
as
the
lord
liveth
as
many
of
the
lamanites
as
believed
in
their
preaching
and
were
converted
unto
the
lord
never
did
fall
away

for
they
became
a
righteous
people
they
did
lay
down
the
weapons
of
their
rebellion
that
they
did
not
fight
against
god
any
more
neither
against
any
of
their
brethren

now
these
are
they
who
were
converted
unto
the
lord

the
people
of
the
lamanites
who
were
in
the
land
of
ishmael

and
also
of
the
people
of
the
lamanites
who
were
in
the
land
of
middoni

and
also
of
the
people
of
the
lamanites
who
were
in
the
city
of
nephi

and
also
of
the
people
of
the
lamanites
who
were
in
the
land
of
shilom
and
who
were
in
the
land
of
shemlon
and
in
the
city
of
lemuel
and
in
the
city
of
shimnilom

and
these
are
the
names
of
the
cities
of
the
lamanites
which
were
converted
unto
the
lord
and
these
are
they
that
laid
down
the
weapons
of
their
rebellion
yea
all
their
weapons
of
war
and
they
were
all
lamanites

and
the
amalekites
were
not
converted
save
only
one
neither
were
any
of
the
amulonites
but
they
did
harden
their
hearts
and
also
the
hearts
of
the
lamanites
in
that
part
of
the
land
wheresoever
they
dwelt
yea
and
all
their
villages
and
all
their
cities

therefore
we
have
named
all
the
cities
of
the
lamanites
in
which
they
did
repent
and
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
and
were
converted

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
and
those
who
were
converted
were
desirous
that
they
might
have
a
name
that
thereby
they
might
be
distinguished
from
their
brethren
therefore
the
king
consulted
with
aaron
and
many
of
their
priests
concerning
the
name
that
they
should
take
upon
them
that
they
might
be
distinguished

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
called
their
names
antinephilehies
and
they
were
called
by
this
name
and
were
no
more
called
lamanites

and
they
began
to
be
a
very
industrious
people
yea
and
they
were
friendly
with
the
nephites
therefore
they
did
open
a
correspondence
with
them
and
the
curse
of
god
did
no
more
follow
them
alma
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
amalekites
and
the
amulonites
and
the
lamanites
who
were
in
the
land
of
amulon
and
also
in
the
land
of
helam
and
who
were
in
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
in
fine
in
all
the
land
round
about
who
had
not
been
converted
and
had
not
taken
upon
them
the
name
of
antinephilehi
were
stirred
up
by
the
amalekites
and
by
the
amulonites
to
anger
against
their
brethren

and
their
hatred
became
exceedingly
sore
against
them
even
insomuch
that
they
began
to
rebel
against
their
king
insomuch
that
they
would
not
that
he
should
be
their
king
therefore
they
took
up
arms
against
the
people
of
antinephilehi

now
the
king
conferred
the
kingdom
upon
his
son
and
he
called
his
name
antinephilehi

and
the
king
died
in
that
selfsame
year
that
the
lamanites
began
to
make
preparations
for
war
against
the
people
of
god

now
when
ammon
and
his
brethren
and
all
those
who
had
come
up
with
him
saw
the
preparations
of
the
lamanites
to
destroy
their
brethren
they
came
forth
to
the
land
of
midian
and
there
ammon
met
all
his
brethren
and
from
thence
they
came
to
the
land
of
ishmael
that
they
might
hold
a
council
with
lamoni
and
also
with
his
brother
antinephilehi
what
they
should
do
to
defend
themselves
against
the
lamanites

now
there
was
not
one
soul
among
all
the
people
who
had
been
converted
unto
the
lord
that
would
take
up
arms
against
their
brethren
nay
they
would
not
even
make
any
preparations
for
war
yea
and
also
their
king
commanded
them
that
they
should
not

now
these
are
the
words
which
he
said
unto
the
people
concerning
the
matter
i
thank
my
god
my
beloved
people
that
our
great
god
has
in
goodness
sent
these
our
brethren
the
nephites
unto
us
to
preach
unto
us
and
to
convince
us
of
the
traditions
of
our
wicked
fathers

and
behold
i
thank
my
great
god
that
he
has
given
us
a
portion
of
his
spirit
to
soften
our
hearts
that
we
have
opened
a
correspondence
with
these
brethren
the
nephites

and
behold
i
also
thank
my
god
that
by
opening
this
correspondence
we
have
been
convinced
of
our
sins
and
of
the
many
murders
which
we
have
committed

and
i
also
thank
my
god
yea
my
great
god
that
he
hath
granted
unto
us
that
we
might
repent
of
these
things
and
also
that
he
hath
forgiven
us
of
those
our
many
sins
and
murders
which
we
have
committed
and
taken
away
the
guilt
from
our
hearts
through
the
merits
of
his
son

and
now
behold
my
brethren
since
it
has
been
all
that
we
could
do
as
we
were
the
most
lost
of
all
mankind
to
repent
of
all
our
sins
and
the
many
murders
which
we
have
committed
and
to
get
god
to
take
them
away
from
our
hearts
for
it
was
all
we
could
do
to
repent
sufficiently
before
god
that
he
would
take
away
our
stain

now
my
best
beloved
brethren
since
god
hath
taken
away
our
stains
and
our
swords
have
become
bright
then
let
us
stain
our
swords
no
more
with
the
blood
of
our
brethren

behold
i
say
unto
you
nay
let
us
retain
our
swords
that
they
be
not
stained
with
the
blood
of
our
brethren
for
perhaps
if
we
should
stain
our
swords
again
they
can
no
more
be
washed
bright
through
the
blood
of
the
son
of
our
great
god
which
shall
be
shed
for
the
atonement
of
our
sins

and
the
great
god
has
had
mercy
on
us
and
made
these
things
known
unto
us
that
we
might
not
perish
yea
and
he
has
made
these
things
known
unto
us
beforehand
because
he
loveth
our
souls
as
well
as
he
loveth
our
children
therefore
in
his
mercy
he
doth
visit
us
by
his
angels
that
the
plan
of
salvation
might
be
made
known
unto
us
as
well
as
unto
future
generations

oh
how
merciful
is
our
god
and
now
behold
since
it
has
been
as
much
as
we
could
do
to
get
our
stains
taken
away
from
us
and
our
swords
are
made
bright
let
us
hide
them
away
that
they
may
be
kept
bright
as
a
testimony
to
our
god
at
the
last
day
or
at
the
day
that
we
shall
be
brought
to
stand
before
him
to
be
judged
that
we
have
not
stained
our
swords
in
the
blood
of
our
brethren
since
he
imparted
his
word
unto
us
and
has
made
us
clean
thereby

and
now
my
brethren
if
our
brethren
seek
to
destroy
us
behold
we
will
hide
away
our
swords
yea
even
we
will
bury
them
deep
in
the
earth
that
they
may
be
kept
bright
as
a
testimony
that
we
have
never
used
them
at
the
last
day
and
if
our
brethren
destroy
us
behold
we
shall
go
to
our
god
and
shall
be
saved

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
king
had
made
an
end
of
these
sayings
and
all
the
people
were
assembled
together
they
took
their
swords
and
all
the
weapons
which
were
used
for
the
shedding
of
mans
blood
and
they
did
bury
them
up
deep
in
the
earth
alma

and
this
they
did
it
being
in
their
view
a
testimony
to
god
and
also
to
men
that
they
never
would
use
weapons
again
for
the
shedding
of
mans
blood
and
this
they
did
vouching
and
covenanting
with
god
that
rather
than
shed
the
blood
of
their
brethren
they
would
give
up
their
own
lives
and
rather
than
take
away
from
a
brother
they
would
give
unto
him
and
rather
than
spend
their
days
in
idleness
they
would
labor
abundantly
with
their
hands

and
thus
we
see
that
when
these
lamanites
were
brought
to
believe
and
to
know
the
truth
they
were
firm
and
would
suffer
even
unto
death
rather
than
commit
sin
and
thus
we
see
that
they
buried
their
weapons
of
peace
or
they
buried
the
weapons
of
war
for
peace

and
it
came
to
pass
that
their
brethren
the
lamanites
made
preparations
for
war
and
came
up
to
the
land
of
nephi
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
the
king
and
to
place
another
in
his
stead
and
also
of
destroying
the
people
of
antinephilehi
out
of
the
land

now
when
the
people
saw
that
they
were
coming
against
them
they
went
out
to
meet
them
and
prostrated
themselves
before
them
to
the
earth
and
began
to
call
on
the
name
of
the
lord
and
thus
they
were
in
this
attitude
when
the
lamanites
began
to
fall
upon
them
and
began
to
slay
them
with
the
sword

and
thus
without
meeting
any
resistance
they
did
slay
a
thousand
and
five
of
them
and
we
know
that
they
are
blessed
for
they
have
gone
to
dwell
with
their
god

now
when
the
lamanites
saw
that
their
brethren
would
not
flee
from
the
sword
neither
would
they
turn
aside
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
but
that
they
would
lie
down
and
perish
and
praised
god
even
in
the
very
act
of
perishing
under
the
sword

now
when
the
lamanites
saw
this
they
did
forbear
from
slaying
them
and
there
were
many
whose
hearts
had
swollen
in
them
for
those
of
their
brethren
who
had
fallen
under
the
sword
for
they
repented
of
the
things
which
they
had
done

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
threw
down
their
weapons
of
war
and
they
would
not
take
them
again
for
they
were
stung
for
the
murders
which
they
had
committed
and
they
came
down
even
as
their
brethren
relying
upon
the
mercies
of
those
whose
arms
were
lifted
to
slay
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
god
were
joined
that
day
by
more
than
the
number
who
had
been
slain
and
those
who
had
been
slain
were
righteous
people
therefore
we
have
no
reason
to
doubt
but
what
they
were
saved

and
there
was
not
a
wicked
man
slain
among
them
but
there
were
more
than
a
thousand
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
thus
we
see
that
the
lord
worketh
in
many
ways
to
the
salvation
of
his
people

now
the
greatest
number
of
those
of
the
lamanites
who
slew
so
many
of
their
brethren
were
amalekites
and
amulonites
the
greatest
number
of
whom
were
after
the
order
of
the
nehors

now
among
those
who
joined
the
people
of
the
lord
there
were
none
who
were
amalekites
or
amulonites
or
who
were
of
the
order
of
nehor
but
they
were
actual
descendants
of
laman
and
lemuel

and
thus
we
can
plainly
discern
that
after
a
people
have
been
once
enlightened
by
the
spirit
of
god
and
have
had
great
knowledge
of
things
pertaining
to
righteousness
and
then
have
fallen
away
into
sin
and
transgression
they
become
more
hardened
and
thus
their
state
becomes
worse
than
though
they
had
never
known
these
things
alma
chapter


and
behold
now
it
came
to
pass
that
those
lamanites
were
more
angry
because
they
had
slain
their
brethren
therefore
they
swore
vengeance
upon
the
nephites
and
they
did
no
more
attempt
to
slay
the
people
of
antinephilehi
at
that
time

but
they
took
their
armies
and
went
over
into
the
borders
of
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
fell
upon
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
of
ammonihah
and
destroyed
them

and
after
that
they
had
many
battles
with
the
nephites
in
the
which
they
were
driven
and
slain

and
among
the
lamanites
who
were
slain
were
almost
all
the
seed
of
amulon
and
his
brethren
who
were
the
priests
of
noah
and
they
were
slain
by
the
hands
of
the
nephites

and
the
remainder
having
fled
into
the
east
wilderness
and
having
usurped
the
power
and
authority
over
the
lamanites
caused
that
many
of
the
lamanites
should
perish
by
fire
because
of
their
belief

for
many
of
them
after
having
suffered
much
loss
and
so
many
afflictions
began
to
be
stirred
up
in
remembrance
of
the
words
which
aaron
and
his
brethren
had
preached
to
them
in
their
land
therefore
they
began
to
disbelieve
the
traditions
of
their
fathers
and
to
believe
in
the
lord
and
that
he
gave
great
power
unto
the
nephites
and
thus
there
were
many
of
them
converted
in
the
wilderness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
those
rulers
who
were
the
remnant
of
the
children
of
amulon
caused
that
they
should
be
put
to
death
yea
all
those
that
believed
in
these
things

now
this
martyrdom
caused
that
many
of
their
brethren
should
be
stirred
up
to
anger
and
there
began
to
be
contention
in
the
wilderness
and
the
lamanites
began
to
hunt
the
seed
of
amulon
and
his
brethren
and
began
to
slay
them
and
they
fled
into
the
east
wilderness

and
behold
they
are
hunted
at
this
day
by
the
lamanites
thus
the
words
of
abinadi
were
brought
to
pass
which
he
said
concerning
the
seed
of
the
priests
who
caused
that
he
should
suffer
death
by
fire

for
he
said
unto
them
what
ye
shall
do
unto
me
shall
be
a
type
of
things
to
come

and
now
abinadi
was
the
first
that
suffered
death
by
fire
because
of
his
belief
in
god
now
this
is
what
he
meant
that
many
should
suffer
death
by
fire
according
as
he
had
suffered

and
he
said
unto
the
priests
of
noah
that
their
seed
should
cause
many
to
be
put
to
death
in
the
like
manner
as
he
was
and
that
they
should
be
scattered
abroad
and
slain
even
as
a
sheep
having
no
shepherd
is
driven
and
slain
by
wild
beasts
and
now
behold
these
words
were
verified
for
they
were
driven
by
the
lamanites
and
they
were
hunted
and
they
were
smitten

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lamanites
saw
that
they
could
not
overpower
the
nephites
they
returned
again
to
their
own
land
and
many
of
them
came
over
to
dwell
in
the
land
of
ishmael
and
the
land
of
nephi
and
did
join
themselves
to
the
people
of
god
who
were
the
people
of
antinephilehi

and
they
did
also
bury
their
weapons
of
war
according
as
their
brethren
had
and
they
began
to
be
a
righteous
people
and
they
did
walk
in
the
ways
of
the
lord
and
did
observe
to
keep
his
commandments
and
his
statutes

yea
and
they
did
keep
the
law
of
moses
for
it
was
expedient
that
they
should
keep
the
law
of
moses
as
yet
for
it
was
not
all
fulfilled
but
notwithstanding
the
law
of
moses
they
did
look
forward
to
the
coming
of
christ
considering
that
the
law
of
moses
was
a
type
of
his
coming
and
believing
that
they
must
keep
those
outward
performances
until
the
time
that
he
should
be
revealed
unto
them

now
they
did
not
suppose
that
salvation
came
by
the
law
of
moses
but
the
law
of
moses
did
serve
to
strengthen
their
faith
in
christ
and
thus
they
did
retain
a
hope
through
faith
unto
eternal
salvation
relying
upon
the
spirit
of
prophecy
which
spake
of
those
things
to
come

and
now
behold
ammon
and
aaron
and
omner
and
himni
and
their
brethren
did
rejoice
exceedingly
for
the
success
which
they
had
had
among
the
lamanites
seeing
that
the
lord
had
granted
unto
them
according
to
their
prayers
and
that
he
had
also
verified
his
word
unto
them
in
every
particular
alma
chapter


and
now
these
are
the
words
of
ammon
to
his
brethren
which
say
thus
my
brothers
and
my
brethren
behold
i
say
unto
you
how
great
reason
have
we
to
rejoice
for
could
we
have
supposed
when
we
started
from
the
land
of
zarahemla
that
god
would
have
granted
unto
us
such
great
blessings

and
now
i
ask
what
great
blessings
has
he
bestowed
upon
us
can
ye
tell

behold
i
answer
for
you
for
our
brethren
the
lamanites
were
in
darkness
yea
even
in
the
darkest
abyss
but
behold
how
many
of
them
are
brought
to
behold
the
marvelous
light
of
god
and
this
is
the
blessing
which
hath
been
bestowed
upon
us
that
we
have
been
made
instruments
in
the
hands
of
god
to
bring
about
this
great
work

behold
thousands
of
them
do
rejoice
and
have
been
brought
into
the
fold
of
god

behold
the
field
was
ripe
and
blessed
are
ye
for
ye
did
thrust
in
the
sickle
and
did
reap
with
your
might
yea
all
the
day
long
did
ye
labor
and
behold
the
number
of
your
sheaves
and
they
shall
be
gathered
into
the
garners
that
they
are
not
wasted

yea
they
shall
not
be
beaten
down
by
the
storm
at
the
last
day
yea
neither
shall
they
be
harrowed
up
by
the
whirlwinds
but
when
the
storm
cometh
they
shall
be
gathered
together
in
their
place
that
the
storm
cannot
penetrate
to
them
yea
neither
shall
they
be
driven
with
fierce
winds
whithersoever
the
enemy
listeth
to
carry
them

but
behold
they
are
in
the
hands
of
the
lord
of
the
harvest
and
they
are
his
and
he
will
raise
them
up
at
the
last
day

blessed
be
the
name
of
our
god
let
us
sing
to
his
praise
yea
let
us
give
thanks
to
his
holy
name
for
he
doth
work
righteousness
forever

for
if
we
had
not
come
up
out
of
the
land
of
zarahemla
these
our
dearly
beloved
brethren
who
have
so
dearly
beloved
us
would
still
have
been
racked
with
hatred
against
us
yea
and
they
would
also
have
been
strangers
to
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
ammon
had
said
these
words
his
brother
aaron
rebuked
him
saying
ammon
i
fear
that
thy
joy
doth
carry
thee
away
unto
boasting

but
ammon
said
unto
him
i
do
not
boast
in
my
own
strength
nor
in
my
own
wisdom
but
behold
my
joy
is
full
yea
my
heart
is
brim
with
joy
and
i
will
rejoice
in
my
god

yea
i
know
that
i
am
nothing
as
to
my
strength
i
am
weak
therefore
i
will
not
boast
of
myself
but
i
will
boast
of
my
god
for
in
his
strength
i
can
do
all
things
yea
behold
many
mighty
miracles
we
have
wrought
in
this
land
for
which
we
will
praise
his
name
forever

behold
how
many
thousands
of
our
brethren
has
he
loosed
from
the
pains
of
hell
and
they
are
brought
to
sing
redeeming
love
and
this
because
of
the
power
of
his
word
which
is
in
us
therefore
have
we
not
great
reason
to
rejoice

yea
we
have
reason
to
praise
him
forever
for
he
is
the
most
high
god
and
has
loosed
our
brethren
from
the
chains
of
hell

yea
they
were
encircled
about
with
everlasting
darkness
and
destruction
but
behold
he
has
brought
them
into
his
everlasting
light
yea
into
everlasting
salvation
and
they
are
encircled
about
with
the
matchless
bounty
of
his
love
yea
and
we
have
been
instruments
in
his
hands
of
doing
this
great
and
marvelous
work

therefore
let
us
glory
yea
we
will
glory
in
the
lord
yea
we
will
rejoice
for
our
joy
is
full
yea
we
will
praise
our
god
forever
behold
who
can
glory
too
much
in
the
lord
yea
who
can
say
too
much
of
his
great
power
and
of
his
mercy
and
of
his
longsuffering
towards
the
children
of
men
behold
i
say
unto
you
i
cannot
say
the
smallest
part
which
i
feel

who
could
have
supposed
that
our
god
would
have
been
so
merciful
as
to
have
snatched
us
from
our
awful
sinful
and
polluted
state

behold
we
went
forth
even
in
wrath
with
mighty
threatenings
to
destroy
his
church

oh
then
why
did
he
not
consign
us
to
an
awful
destruction
yea
why
did
he
not
let
the
sword
of
his
justice
fall
upon
us
and
doom
us
to
eternal
despair

oh
my
soul
almost
as
it
were
fleeth
at
the
thought
behold
he
did
not
exercise
his
justice
upon
us
but
in
his
great
mercy
hath
brought
us
over
that
everlasting
gulf
of
death
and
misery
even
to
the
salvation
of
our
souls

and
now
behold
my
brethren
what
natural
man
is
there
that
knoweth
these
things
i
say
unto
you
there
is
none
that
knoweth
these
things
save
it
be
the
penitent

yea
he
that
repenteth
and
exerciseth
faith
and
bringeth
forth
good
works
and
prayeth
continually
without
ceasingunto
such
it
is
given
to
know
the
mysteries
of
god
yea
unto
such
it
shall
be
given
to
reveal
things
which
never
have
been
revealed
yea
and
it
shall
be
given
unto
such
to
bring
thousands
of
souls
to
repentance
even
as
it
has
been
given
unto
us
to
bring
these
our
brethren
to
repentance

now
do
ye
remember
my
brethren
that
we
said
unto
our
brethren
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
we
go
up
to
the
land
of
nephi
to
preach
unto
our
brethren
the
lamanites
and
they
laughed
us
to
scorn

for
they
said
unto
us
do
ye
suppose
that
ye
can
bring
the
lamanites
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
do
ye
suppose
that
ye
can
convince
the
lamanites
of
the
incorrectness
of
the
traditions
of
their
fathers
as
stiffnecked
a
people
as
they
are
whose
hearts
delight
in
the
shedding
of
blood
whose
days
have
been
spent
in
the
grossest
iniquity
whose
ways
have
been
the
ways
of
a
transgressor
from
the
beginning
now
my
brethren
ye
remember
that
this
was
their
language

and
moreover
they
did
say
let
us
take
up
arms
against
them
that
we
destroy
them
and
their
iniquity
out
of
the
land
lest
they
overrun
us
and
destroy
us

but
behold
my
beloved
brethren
we
came
into
the
wilderness
not
with
the
intent
to
destroy
our
brethren
but
with
the
intent
that
perhaps
we
might
save
some
few
of
their
souls

now
when
our
hearts
were
depressed
and
we
were
about
to
turn
back
behold
the
lord
comforted
us
and
said
go
amongst
thy
brethren
the
lamanites
and
bear
with
patience
thine
afflictions
and
i
will
give
unto
you
success

and
now
behold
we
have
come
and
been
forth
amongst
them
and
we
have
been
patient
in
our
sufferings
and
we
have
suffered
every
privation
yea
we
have
traveled
from
house
to
house
relying
upon
the
mercies
of
the
worldnot
upon
the
mercies
of
the
world
alone
but
upon
the
mercies
of
god

and
we
have
entered
into
their
houses
and
taught
them
and
we
have
taught
them
in
their
streets
yea
and
we
have
taught
them
upon
their
hills
and
we
have
also
entered
into
their
temples
and
their
synagogues
and
taught
them
and
we
have
been
cast
out
and
mocked
and
spit
upon
and
smote
upon
our
cheeks
and
we
have
been
stoned
and
taken
and
bound
with
strong
cords
and
cast
into
prison
and
through
the
power
and
wisdom
of
god
we
have
been
delivered
again

and
we
have
suffered
all
manner
of
afflictions
and
all
this
that
perhaps
we
might
be
the
means
of
saving
some
soul
and
we
supposed
that
our
joy
would
be
full
if
perhaps
we
could
be
the
means
of
saving
some

now
behold
we
can
look
forth
and
see
the
fruits
of
our
labors
and
are
they
few
i
say
unto
you
nay
they
are
many
yea
and
we
can
witness
of
their
sincerity
because
of
their
love
towards
their
brethren
and
also
towards
us

for
behold
they
had
rather
sacrifice
their
lives
than
even
to
take
the
life
of
their
enemy
and
they
have
buried
their
weapons
of
war
deep
in
the
earth
because
of
their
love
towards
their
brethren

and
now
behold
i
say
unto
you
has
there
been
so
great
love
in
all
the
land
behold
i
say
unto
you
nay
there
has
not
even
among
the
nephites

for
behold
they
would
take
up
arms
against
their
brethren
they
would
not
suffer
themselves
to
be
slain
but
behold
how
many
of
these
have
laid
down
their
lives
and
we
know
that
they
have
gone
to
their
god
because
of
their
love
and
of
their
hatred
to
sin

now
have
we
not
reason
to
rejoice
yea
i
say
unto
you
there
never
were
men
that
had
so
great
reason
to
rejoice
as
we
since
the
world
began
yea
and
my
joy
is
carried
away
even
unto
boasting
in
my
god
for
he
has
all
power
all
wisdom
and
all
understanding
he
comprehendeth
all
things
and
he
is
a
merciful
being
even
unto
salvation
to
those
who
will
repent
and
believe
on
his
name

now
if
this
is
boasting
even
so
will
i
boast
for
this
is
my
life
and
my
light
my
joy
and
my
salvation
and
my
redemption
from
everlasting
wo
yea
blessed
is
the
name
of
my
god
who
has
been
mindful
of
this
people
who
are
a
branch
of
the
tree
of
israel
and
has
been
lost
from
its
body
in
a
strange
land
yea
i
say
blessed
be
the
name
of
my
god
who
has
been
mindful
of
us
wanderers
in
a
strange
land

now
my
brethren
we
see
that
god
is
mindful
of
every
people
whatsoever
land
they
may
be
in
yea
he
numbereth
his
people
and
his
bowels
of
mercy
are
over
all
the
earth
now
this
is
my
joy
and
my
great
thanksgiving
yea
and
i
will
give
thanks
unto
my
god
forever
amen

chapter


now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
those
lamanites
who
had
gone
to
war
against
the
nephites
had
found
after
their
many
struggles
to
destroy
them
that
it
was
in
vain
to
seek
their
destruction
they
returned
again
to
the
land
of
nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
amalekites
because
of
their
loss
were
exceedingly
angry
and
when
they
saw
that
they
could
not
seek
revenge
from
the
nephites
they
began
to
stir
up
the
people
in
anger
against
their
brethren
the
people
of
antinephilehi
therefore
they
began
again
to
destroy
them

now
this
people
again
refused
to
take
their
arms
and
they
suffered
themselves
to
be
slain
according
to
the
desires
of
their
enemies

now
when
ammon
and
his
brethren
saw
this
work
of
destruction
among
those
whom
they
so
dearly
beloved
and
among
those
who
had
so
dearly
beloved
themfor
they
were
treated
as
though
they
were
angels
sent
from
god
to
save
them
from
everlasting
destructiontherefore
when
ammon
and
his
brethren
saw
this
great
work
of
destruction
they
were
moved
with
compassion
and
they
said
unto
the
king

let
us
gather
together
this
people
of
the
lord
and
let
us
go
down
to
the
land
of
zarahemla
to
our
brethren
the
nephites
and
flee
out
of
the
hands
of
our
enemies
that
we
be
not
destroyed

but
the
king
said
unto
them
behold
the
nephites
will
destroy
us
because
of
the
many
murders
and
sins
we
have
committed
against
them

and
ammon
said
i
will
go
and
inquire
of
the
lord
and
if
he
say
unto
us
go
down
unto
our
brethren
will
ye
go

and
the
king
said
unto
him
yea
if
the
lord
saith
unto
us
go
we
will
go
down
unto
our
brethren
and
we
will
be
their
slaves
until
we
repair
unto
them
the
many
murders
and
sins
which
we
have
committed
against
them

but
ammon
said
unto
him
it
is
against
the
law
of
our
brethren
which
was
established
by
my
father
that
there
should
be
any
slaves
among
them
therefore
let
us
go
down
and
rely
upon
the
mercies
of
our
brethren

but
the
king
said
unto
him
inquire
of
the
lord
and
if
he
saith
unto
us
go
we
will
go
otherwise
we
will
perish
in
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
ammon
went
and
inquired
of
the
lord
and
the
lord
said
unto
him

get
this
people
out
of
this
land
that
they
perish
not
for
satan
has
great
hold
on
the
hearts
of
the
amalekites
who
do
stir
up
the
lamanites
to
anger
against
their
brethren
to
slay
them
therefore
get
thee
out
of
this
land
and
blessed
are
this
people
in
this
generation
for
i
will
preserve
them

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
ammon
went
and
told
the
king
all
the
words
which
the
lord
had
said
unto
him

and
they
gathered
together
all
their
people
yea
all
the
people
of
the
lord
and
did
gather
together
all
their
flocks
and
herds
and
departed
out
of
the
land
and
came
into
the
wilderness
which
divided
the
land
of
nephi
from
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
came
over
near
the
borders
of
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
ammon
said
unto
them
behold
i
and
my
brethren
will
go
forth
into
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
ye
shall
remain
here
until
we
return
and
we
will
try
the
hearts
of
our
brethren
whether
they
will
that
ye
shall
come
into
their
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
ammon
was
going
forth
into
the
land
that
he
and
his
brethren
met
alma
over
in
the
place
of
which
has
been
spoken
and
behold
this
was
a
joyful
meeting

now
the
joy
of
ammon
was
so
great
even
that
he
was
full
yea
he
was
swallowed
up
in
the
joy
of
his
god
even
to
the
exhausting
of
his
strength
and
he
fell
again
to
the
earth

now
was
not
this
exceeding
joy
behold
this
is
joy
which
none
receiveth
save
it
be
the
truly
penitent
and
humble
seeker
of
happiness

now
the
joy
of
alma
in
meeting
his
brethren
was
truly
great
and
also
the
joy
of
aaron
of
omner
and
himni
but
behold
their
joy
was
not
that
to
exceed
their
strength

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
conducted
his
brethren
back
to
the
land
of
zarahemla
even
to
his
own
house
and
they
went
and
told
the
chief
judge
all
the
things
that
had
happened
unto
them
in
the
land
of
nephi
among
their
brethren
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
chief
judge
sent
a
proclamation
throughout
all
the
land
desiring
the
voice
of
the
people
concerning
the
admitting
their
brethren
who
were
the
people
of
antinephilehi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
people
came
saying
behold
we
will
give
up
the
land
of
jershon
which
is
on
the
east
by
the
sea
which
joins
the
land
bountiful
which
is
on
the
south
of
the
land
bountiful
and
this
land
jershon
is
the
land
which
we
will
give
unto
our
brethren
for
an
inheritance

and
behold
we
will
set
our
armies
between
the
land
jershon
and
the
land
nephi
that
we
may
protect
our
brethren
in
the
land
jershon
and
this
we
do
for
our
brethren
on
account
of
their
fear
to
take
up
arms
against
their
brethren
lest
they
should
commit
sin
and
this
their
great
fear
came
because
of
their
sore
repentance
which
they
had
on
account
of
their
many
murders
and
their
awful
wickedness

and
now
behold
this
will
we
do
unto
our
brethren
that
they
may
inherit
the
land
jershon
and
we
will
guard
them
from
their
enemies
with
our
armies
on
condition
that
they
will
give
us
a
portion
of
their
substance
to
assist
us
that
we
may
maintain
our
armies

now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
ammon
had
heard
this
he
returned
to
the
people
of
antinephilehi
and
also
alma
with
him
into
the
wilderness
where
they
had
pitched
their
tents
and
made
known
unto
them
all
these
things
and
alma
also
related
unto
them
his
conversion
with
ammon
and
aaron
and
his
brethren

and
it
came
to
pass
that
it
did
cause
great
joy
among
them
and
they
went
down
into
the
land
of
jershon
and
took
possession
of
the
land
of
jershon
and
they
were
called
by
the
nephites
the
people
of
ammon
therefore
they
were
distinguished
by
that
name
ever
after

and
they
were
among
the
people
of
nephi
and
also
numbered
among
the
people
who
were
of
the
church
of
god
and
they
were
also
distinguished
for
their
zeal
towards
god
and
also
towards
men
for
they
were
perfectly
honest
and
upright
in
all
things
and
they
were
firm
in
the
faith
of
christ
even
unto
the
end

and
they
did
look
upon
shedding
the
blood
of
their
brethren
with
the
greatest
abhorrence
and
they
never
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
take
up
arms
against
their
brethren
and
they
never
did
look
upon
death
with
any
degree
of
terror
for
their
hope
and
views
of
christ
and
the
resurrection
therefore
death
was
swallowed
up
to
them
by
the
victory
of
christ
over
it

therefore
they
would
suffer
death
in
the
most
aggravating
and
distressing
manner
which
could
be
inflicted
by
their
brethren
before
they
would
take
the
sword
or
cimeter
to
smite
them

and
thus
they
were
a
zealous
and
beloved
people
a
highly
favored
people
of
the
lord
alma
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
people
of
ammon
were
established
in
the
land
of
jershon
and
a
church
also
established
in
the
land
of
jershon
and
the
armies
of
the
nephites
were
set
round
about
the
land
of
jershon
yea
in
all
the
borders
round
about
the
land
of
zarahemla
behold
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
had
followed
their
brethren
into
the
wilderness

and
thus
there
was
a
tremendous
battle
yea
even
such
an
one
as
never
had
been
known
among
all
the
people
in
the
land
from
the
time
lehi
left
jerusalem
yea
and
tens
of
thousands
of
the
lamanites
were
slain
and
scattered
abroad

yea
and
also
there
was
a
tremendous
slaughter
among
the
people
of
nephi
nevertheless
the
lamanites
were
driven
and
scattered
and
the
people
of
nephi
returned
again
to
their
land

and
now
this
was
a
time
that
there
was
a
great
mourning
and
lamentation
heard
throughout
all
the
land
among
all
the
people
of
nephi

yea
the
cry
of
widows
mourning
for
their
husbands
and
also
of
fathers
mourning
for
their
sons
and
the
daughter
for
the
brother
yea
the
brother
for
the
father
and
thus
the
cry
of
mourning
was
heard
among
all
of
them
mourning
for
their
kindred
who
had
been
slain

and
now
surely
this
was
a
sorrowful
day
yea
a
time
of
solemnity
and
a
time
of
much
fasting
and
prayer

and
thus
endeth
the
fifteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi

and
this
is
the
account
of
ammon
and
his
brethren
their
journeyings
in
the
land
of
nephi
their
sufferings
in
the
land
their
sorrows
and
their
afflictions
and
their
incomprehensible
joy
and
the
reception
and
safety
of
the
brethren
in
the
land
of
jershon
and
now
may
the
lord
the
redeemer
of
all
men
bless
their
souls
forever

and
this
is
the
account
of
the
wars
and
contentions
among
the
nephites
and
also
the
wars
between
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites
and
the
fifteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
is
ended

and
from
the
first
year
to
the
fifteenth
has
brought
to
pass
the
destruction
of
many
thousand
lives
yea
it
has
brought
to
pass
an
awful
scene
of
bloodshed

and
the
bodies
of
many
thousands
are
laid
low
in
the
earth
while
the
bodies
of
many
thousands
are
moldering
in
heaps
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
yea
and
many
thousands
are
mourning
for
the
loss
of
their
kindred
because
they
have
reason
to
fear
according
to
the
promises
of
the
lord
that
they
are
consigned
to
a
state
of
endless
wo

while
many
thousands
of
others
truly
mourn
for
the
loss
of
their
kindred
yet
they
rejoice
and
exult
in
the
hope
and
even
know
according
to
the
promises
of
the
lord
that
they
are
raised
to
dwell
at
the
right
hand
of
god
in
a
state
of
neverending
happiness

and
thus
we
see
how
great
the
inequality
of
man
is
because
of
sin
and
transgression
and
the
power
of
the
devil
which
comes
by
the
cunning
plans
which
he
hath
devised
to
ensnare
the
hearts
of
men

and
thus
we
see
the
great
call
of
diligence
of
men
to
labor
in
the
vineyards
of
the
lord
and
thus
we
see
the
great
reason
of
sorrow
and
also
of
rejoicingsorrow
because
of
death
and
destruction
among
men
and
joy
because
of
the
light
of
christ
unto
life
alma
chapter


o
that
i
were
an
angel
and
could
have
the
wish
of
mine
heart
that
i
might
go
forth
and
speak
with
the
trump
of
god
with
a
voice
to
shake
the
earth
and
cry
repentance
unto
every
people

yea
i
would
declare
unto
every
soul
as
with
the
voice
of
thunder
repentance
and
the
plan
of
redemption
that
they
should
repent
and
come
unto
our
god
that
there
might
not
be
more
sorrow
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth

but
behold
i
am
a
man
and
do
sin
in
my
wish
for
i
ought
to
be
content
with
the
things
which
the
lord
hath
allotted
unto
me

i
ought
not
to
harrow
up
in
my
desires
the
firm
decree
of
a
just
god
for
i
know
that
he
granteth
unto
men
according
to
their
desire
whether
it
be
unto
death
or
unto
life
yea
i
know
that
he
allotteth
unto
men
yea
decreeth
unto
them
decrees
which
are
unalterable
according
to
their
wills
whether
they
be
unto
salvation
or
unto
destruction

yea
and
i
know
that
good
and
evil
have
come
before
all
men
he
that
knoweth
not
good
from
evil
is
blameless
but
he
that
knoweth
good
and
evil
to
him
it
is
given
according
to
his
desires
whether
he
desireth
good
or
evil
life
or
death
joy
or
remorse
of
conscience

now
seeing
that
i
know
these
things
why
should
i
desire
more
than
to
perform
the
work
to
which
i
have
been
called

why
should
i
desire
that
i
were
an
angel
that
i
could
speak
unto
all
the
ends
of
the
earth

for
behold
the
lord
doth
grant
unto
all
nations
of
their
own
nation
and
tongue
to
teach
his
word
yea
in
wisdom
all
that
he
seeth
fit
that
they
should
have
therefore
we
see
that
the
lord
doth
counsel
in
wisdom
according
to
that
which
is
just
and
true

i
know
that
which
the
lord
hath
commanded
me
and
i
glory
in
it
i
do
not
glory
of
myself
but
i
glory
in
that
which
the
lord
hath
commanded
me
yea
and
this
is
my
glory
that
perhaps
i
may
be
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
god
to
bring
some
soul
to
repentance
and
this
is
my
joy

and
behold
when
i
see
many
of
my
brethren
truly
penitent
and
coming
to
the
lord
their
god
then
is
my
soul
filled
with
joy
then
do
i
remember
what
the
lord
has
done
for
me
yea
even
that
he
hath
heard
my
prayer
yea
then
do
i
remember
his
merciful
arm
which
he
extended
towards
me

yea
and
i
also
remember
the
captivity
of
my
fathers
for
i
surely
do
know
that
the
lord
did
deliver
them
out
of
bondage
and
by
this
did
establish
his
church
yea
the
lord
god
the
god
of
abraham
the
god
of
isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
did
deliver
them
out
of
bondage

yea
i
have
always
remembered
the
captivity
of
my
fathers
and
that
same
god
who
delivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
the
egyptians
did
deliver
them
out
of
bondage

yea
and
that
same
god
did
establish
his
church
among
them
yea
and
that
same
god
hath
called
me
by
a
holy
calling
to
preach
the
word
unto
this
people
and
hath
given
me
much
success
in
the
which
my
joy
is
full

but
i
do
not
joy
in
my
own
success
alone
but
my
joy
is
more
full
because
of
the
success
of
my
brethren
who
have
been
up
to
the
land
of
nephi

behold
they
have
labored
exceedingly
and
have
brought
forth
much
fruit
and
how
great
shall
be
their
reward

now
when
i
think
of
the
success
of
these
my
brethren
my
soul
is
carried
away
even
to
the
separation
of
it
from
the
body
as
it
were
so
great
is
my
joy

and
now
may
god
grant
unto
these
my
brethren
that
they
may
sit
down
in
the
kingdom
of
god
yea
and
also
all
those
who
are
the
fruit
of
their
labors
that
they
may
go
no
more
out
but
that
they
may
praise
him
forever
and
may
god
grant
that
it
may
be
done
according
to
my
words
even
as
i
have
spoken
amen
alma
chapter


behold
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
people
of
ammon
were
established
in
the
land
of
jershon
yea
and
also
after
the
lamanites
were
driven
out
of
the
land
and
their
dead
were
buried
by
the
people
of
the
land

now
their
dead
were
not
numbered
because
of
the
greatness
of
their
numbers
neither
were
the
dead
of
the
nephites
numberedbut
it
came
to
pass
after
they
had
buried
their
dead
and
also
after
the
days
of
fasting
and
mourning
and
prayer
and
it
was
in
the
sixteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
there
began
to
be
continual
peace
throughout
all
the
land

yea
and
the
people
did
observe
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
and
they
were
strict
in
observing
the
ordinances
of
god
according
to
the
law
of
moses
for
they
were
taught
to
keep
the
law
of
moses
until
it
should
be
fulfilled

and
thus
the
people
did
have
no
disturbance
in
all
the
sixteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
commencement
of
the
seventeenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
there
was
continual
peace

but
it
came
to
pass
in
the
latter
end
of
the
seventeenth
year
there
came
a
man
into
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
he
was
antichrist
for
he
began
to
preach
unto
the
people
against
the
prophecies
which
had
been
spoken
by
the
prophets
concerning
the
coming
of
christ

now
there
was
no
law
against
a
mans
belief
for
it
was
strictly
contrary
to
the
commands
of
god
that
there
should
be
a
law
which
should
bring
men
on
to
unequal
grounds

for
thus
saith
the
scripture
choose
ye
this
day
whom
ye
will
serve

now
if
a
man
desired
to
serve
god
it
was
his
privilege
or
rather
if
he
believed
in
god
it
was
his
privilege
to
serve
him
but
if
he
did
not
believe
in
him
there
was
no
law
to
punish
him

but
if
he
murdered
he
was
punished
unto
death
and
if
he
robbed
he
was
also
punished
and
if
he
stole
he
was
also
punished
and
if
he
committed
adultery
he
was
also
punished
yea
for
all
this
wickedness
they
were
punished

for
there
was
a
law
that
men
should
be
judged
according
to
their
crimes
nevertheless
there
was
no
law
against
a
mans
belief
therefore
a
man
was
punished
only
for
the
crimes
which
he
had
done
therefore
all
men
were
on
equal
grounds

and
this
antichrist
whose
name
was
korihor
and
the
law
could
have
no
hold
upon
him
began
to
preach
unto
the
people
that
there
should
be
no
christ
and
after
this
manner
did
he
preach
saying

o
ye
that
are
bound
down
under
a
foolish
and
a
vain
hope
why
do
ye
yoke
yourselves
with
such
foolish
things
why
do
ye
look
for
a
christ
for
no
man
can
know
of
anything
which
is
to
come

behold
these
things
which
ye
call
prophecies
which
ye
say
are
handed
down
by
holy
prophets
behold
they
are
foolish
traditions
of
your
fathers

how
do
ye
know
of
their
surety
behold
ye
cannot
know
of
things
which
ye
do
not
see
therefore
ye
cannot
know
that
there
shall
be
a
christ

ye
look
forward
and
say
that
ye
see
a
remission
of
your
sins
but
behold
it
is
the
effect
of
a
frenzied
mind
and
this
derangement
of
your
minds
comes
because
of
the
traditions
of
your
fathers
which
lead
you
away
into
a
belief
of
things
which
are
not
so

and
many
more
such
things
did
he
say
unto
them
telling
them
that
there
could
be
no
atonement
made
for
the
sins
of
men
but
every
man
fared
in
this
life
according
to
the
management
of
the
creature
therefore
every
man
prospered
according
to
his
genius
and
that
every
man
conquered
according
to
his
strength
and
whatsoever
a
man
did
was
no
crime

and
thus
he
did
preach
unto
them
leading
away
the
hearts
of
many
causing
them
to
lift
up
their
heads
in
their
wickedness
yea
leading
away
many
women
and
also
men
to
commit
whoredomstelling
them
that
when
a
man
was
dead
that
was
the
end
thereof

now
this
man
went
over
to
the
land
of
jershon
also
to
preach
these
things
among
the
people
of
ammon
who
were
once
the
people
of
the
lamanites

but
behold
they
were
more
wise
than
many
of
the
nephites
for
they
took
him
and
bound
him
and
carried
him
before
ammon
who
was
a
high
priest
over
that
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
caused
that
he
should
be
carried
out
of
the
land
and
he
came
over
into
the
land
of
gideon
and
began
to
preach
unto
them
also
and
here
he
did
not
have
much
success
for
he
was
taken
and
bound
and
carried
before
the
high
priest
and
also
the
chief
judge
over
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
high
priest
said
unto
him
why
do
ye
go
about
perverting
the
ways
of
the
lord
why
do
ye
teach
this
people
that
there
shall
be
no
christ
to
interrupt
their
rejoicings
why
do
ye
speak
against
all
the
prophecies
of
the
holy
prophets

now
the
high
priests
name
was
giddonah
and
korihor
said
unto
him
because
i
do
not
teach
the
foolish
traditions
of
your
fathers
and
because
i
do
not
teach
this
people
to
bind
themselves
down
under
the
foolish
ordinances
and
performances
which
are
laid
down
by
ancient
priests
to
usurp
power
and
authority
over
them
to
keep
them
in
ignorance
that
they
may
not
lift
up
their
heads
but
be
brought
down
according
to
thy
words

ye
say
that
this
people
is
a
free
people
behold
i
say
they
are
in
bondage
ye
say
that
those
ancient
prophecies
are
true
behold
i
say
that
ye
do
not
know
that
they
are
true

ye
say
that
this
people
is
a
guilty
and
a
fallen
people
because
of
the
transgression
of
a
parent
behold
i
say
that
a
child
is
not
guilty
because
of
its
parents

and
ye
also
say
that
christ
shall
come
but
behold
i
say
that
ye
do
not
know
that
there
shall
be
a
christ
and
ye
say
also
that
he
shall
be
slain
for
the
sins
of
the
world

and
thus
ye
lead
away
this
people
after
the
foolish
traditions
of
your
fathers
and
according
to
your
own
desires
and
ye
keep
them
down
even
as
it
were
in
bondage
that
ye
may
glut
yourselves
with
the
labors
of
their
hands
that
they
durst
not
look
up
with
boldness
and
that
they
durst
not
enjoy
their
rights
and
privileges

yea
they
durst
not
make
use
of
that
which
is
their
own
lest
they
should
offend
their
priests
who
do
yoke
them
according
to
their
desires
and
have
brought
them
to
believe
by
their
traditions
and
their
dreams
and
their
whims
and
their
visions
and
their
pretended
mysteries
that
they
should
if
they
did
not
do
according
to
their
words
offend
some
unknown
being
who
they
say
is
goda
being
who
never
has
been
seen
or
known
who
never
was
nor
ever
will
be

now
when
the
high
priest
and
the
chief
judge
saw
the
hardness
of
his
heart
yea
when
they
saw
that
he
would
revile
even
against
god
they
would
not
make
any
reply
to
his
words
but
they
caused
that
he
should
be
bound
and
they
delivered
him
up
into
the
hands
of
the
officers
and
sent
him
to
the
land
of
zarahemla
that
he
might
be
brought
before
alma
and
the
chief
judge
who
was
governor
over
all
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
was
brought
before
alma
and
the
chief
judge
he
did
go
on
in
the
same
manner
as
he
did
in
the
land
of
gideon
yea
he
went
on
to
blaspheme

and
he
did
rise
up
in
great
swelling
words
before
alma
and
did
revile
against
the
priests
and
teachers
accusing
them
of
leading
away
the
people
after
the
silly
traditions
of
their
fathers
for
the
sake
of
glutting
on
the
labors
of
the
people

now
alma
said
unto
him
thou
knowest
that
we
do
not
glut
ourselves
upon
the
labors
of
this
people
for
behold
i
have
labored
even
from
the
commencement
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
until
now
with
mine
own
hands
for
my
support
notwithstanding
my
many
travels
round
about
the
land
to
declare
the
word
of
god
unto
my
people

and
notwithstanding
the
many
labors
which
i
have
performed
in
the
church
i
have
never
received
so
much
as
even
one
senine
for
my
labor
neither
has
any
of
my
brethren
save
it
were
in
the
judgmentseat
and
then
we
have
received
only
according
to
law
for
our
time

and
now
if
we
do
not
receive
anything
for
our
labors
in
the
church
what
doth
it
profit
us
to
labor
in
the
church
save
it
were
to
declare
the
truth
that
we
may
have
rejoicings
in
the
joy
of
our
brethren

then
why
sayest
thou
that
we
preach
unto
this
people
to
get
gain
when
thou
of
thyself
knowest
that
we
receive
no
gain
and
now
believest
thou
that
we
deceive
this
people
that
causes
such
joy
in
their
hearts

and
korihor
answered
him
yea

and
then
alma
said
unto
him
believest
thou
that
there
is
a
god

and
he
answered
nay

now
alma
said
unto
him
will
ye
deny
again
that
there
is
a
god
and
also
deny
the
christ
for
behold
i
say
unto
you
i
know
there
is
a
god
and
also
that
christ
shall
come

and
now
what
evidence
have
ye
that
there
is
no
god
or
that
christ
cometh
not
i
say
unto
you
that
ye
have
none
save
it
be
your
word
only

but
behold
i
have
all
things
as
a
testimony
that
these
things
are
true
and
ye
also
have
all
things
as
a
testimony
unto
you
that
they
are
true
and
will
ye
deny
them
believest
thou
that
these
things
are
true

behold
i
know
that
thou
believest
but
thou
art
possessed
with
a
lying
spirit
and
ye
have
put
off
the
spirit
of
god
that
it
may
have
no
place
in
you
but
the
devil
has
power
over
you
and
he
doth
carry
you
about
working
devices
that
he
may
destroy
the
children
of
god

and
now
korihor
said
unto
alma
if
thou
wilt
show
me
a
sign
that
i
may
be
convinced
that
there
is
a
god
yea
show
unto
me
that
he
hath
power
and
then
will
i
be
convinced
of
the
truth
of
thy
words

but
alma
said
unto
him
thou
hast
had
signs
enough
will
ye
tempt
your
god
will
ye
say
show
unto
me
a
sign
when
ye
have
the
testimony
of
all
these
thy
brethren
and
also
all
the
holy
prophets
the
scriptures
are
laid
before
thee
yea
and
all
things
denote
there
is
a
god
yea
even
the
earth
and
all
things
that
are
upon
the
face
of
it
yea
and
its
motion
yea
and
also
all
the
planets
which
move
in
their
regular
form
do
witness
that
there
is
a
supreme
creator

and
yet
do
ye
go
about
leading
away
the
hearts
of
this
people
testifying
unto
them
there
is
no
god
and
yet
will
ye
deny
against
all
these
witnesses
and
he
said
yea
i
will
deny
except
ye
shall
show
me
a
sign

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
said
unto
him
behold
i
am
grieved
because
of
the
hardness
of
your
heart
yea
that
ye
will
still
resist
the
spirit
of
the
truth
that
thy
soul
may
be
destroyed

but
behold
it
is
better
that
thy
soul
should
be
lost
than
that
thou
shouldst
be
the
means
of
bringing
many
souls
down
to
destruction
by
thy
lying
and
by
thy
flattering
words
therefore
if
thou
shalt
deny
again
behold
god
shall
smite
thee
that
thou
shalt
become
dumb
that
thou
shalt
never
open
thy
mouth
any
more
that
thou
shalt
not
deceive
this
people
any
more

now
korihor
said
unto
him
i
do
not
deny
the
existence
of
a
god
but
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
a
god
and
i
say
also
that
ye
do
not
know
that
there
is
a
god
and
except
ye
show
me
a
sign
i
will
not
believe

now
alma
said
unto
him
this
will
i
give
unto
thee
for
a
sign
that
thou
shalt
be
struck
dumb
according
to
my
words
and
i
say
that
in
the
name
of
god
ye
shall
be
struck
dumb
that
ye
shall
no
more
have
utterance

now
when
alma
had
said
these
words
korihor
was
struck
dumb
that
he
could
not
have
utterance
according
to
the
words
of
alma

and
now
when
the
chief
judge
saw
this
he
put
forth
his
hand
and
wrote
unto
korihor
saying
art
thou
convinced
of
the
power
of
god
in
whom
did
ye
desire
that
alma
should
show
forth
his
sign
would
ye
that
he
should
afflict
others
to
show
unto
thee
a
sign
behold
he
has
showed
unto
you
a
sign
and
now
will
ye
dispute
more

and
korihor
put
forth
his
hand
and
wrote
saying
i
know
that
i
am
dumb
for
i
cannot
speak
and
i
know
that
nothing
save
it
were
the
power
of
god
could
bring
this
upon
me
yea
and
i
always
knew
that
there
was
a
god

but
behold
the
devil
hath
deceived
me
for
he
appeared
unto
me
in
the
form
of
an
angel
and
said
unto
me
go
and
reclaim
this
people
for
they
have
all
gone
astray
after
an
unknown
god
and
he
said
unto
me
there
is
no
god
yea
and
he
taught
me
that
which
i
should
say
and
i
have
taught
his
words
and
i
taught
them
because
they
were
pleasing
unto
the
carnal
mind
and
i
taught
them
even
until
i
had
much
success
insomuch
that
i
verily
believed
that
they
were
true
and
for
this
cause
i
withstood
the
truth
even
until
i
have
brought
this
great
curse
upon
me

now
when
he
had
said
this
he
besought
that
alma
should
pray
unto
god
that
the
curse
might
be
taken
from
him

but
alma
said
unto
him
if
this
curse
should
be
taken
from
thee
thou
wouldst
again
lead
away
the
hearts
of
this
people
therefore
it
shall
be
unto
thee
even
as
the
lord
will

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
curse
was
not
taken
off
of
korihor
but
he
was
cast
out
and
went
about
from
house
to
house
begging
for
his
food

now
the
knowledge
of
what
had
happened
unto
korihor
was
immediately
published
throughout
all
the
land
yea
the
proclamation
was
sent
forth
by
the
chief
judge
to
all
the
people
in
the
land
declaring
unto
those
who
had
believed
in
the
words
of
korihor
that
they
must
speedily
repent
lest
the
same
judgments
would
come
unto
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
all
convinced
of
the
wickedness
of
korihor
therefore
they
were
all
converted
again
unto
the
lord
and
this
put
an
end
to
the
iniquity
after
the
manner
of
korihor
and
korihor
did
go
about
from
house
to
house
begging
food
for
his
support

and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
he
went
forth
among
the
people
yea
among
a
people
who
had
separated
themselves
from
the
nephites
and
called
themselves
zoramites
being
led
by
a
man
whose
name
was
zoramand
as
he
went
forth
amongst
them
behold
he
was
run
upon
and
trodden
down
even
until
he
was
dead

and
thus
we
see
the
end
of
him
who
perverteth
the
ways
of
the
lord
and
thus
we
see
that
the
devil
will
not
support
his
children
at
the
last
day
but
doth
speedily
drag
them
down
to
hell
alma
chapter


now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
end
of
korihor
alma
having
received
tidings
that
the
zoramites
were
perverting
the
ways
of
the
lord
and
that
zoram
who
was
their
leader
was
leading
the
hearts
of
the
people
to
bow
down
to
dumb
idols
his
heart
again
began
to
sicken
because
of
the
iniquity
of
the
people

for
it
was
the
cause
of
great
sorrow
to
alma
to
know
of
iniquity
among
his
people
therefore
his
heart
was
exceedingly
sorrowful
because
of
the
separation
of
the
zoramites
from
the
nephites

now
the
zoramites
had
gathered
themselves
together
in
a
land
which
they
called
antionum
which
was
east
of
the
land
of
zarahemla
which
lay
nearly
bordering
upon
the
seashore
which
was
south
of
the
land
of
jershon
which
also
bordered
upon
the
wilderness
south
which
wilderness
was
full
of
the
lamanites

now
the
nephites
greatly
feared
that
the
zoramites
would
enter
into
a
correspondence
with
the
lamanites
and
that
it
would
be
the
means
of
great
loss
on
the
part
of
the
nephites

and
now
as
the
preaching
of
the
word
had
a
great
tendency
to
lead
the
people
to
do
that
which
was
justyea
it
had
had
more
powerful
effect
upon
the
minds
of
the
people
than
the
sword
or
anything
else
which
had
happened
unto
themtherefore
alma
thought
it
was
expedient
that
they
should
try
the
virtue
of
the
word
of
god

therefore
he
took
ammon
and
aaron
and
omner
and
himni
he
did
leave
in
the
church
in
zarahemla
but
the
former
three
he
took
with
him
and
also
amulek
and
zeezrom
who
were
at
melek
and
he
also
took
two
of
his
sons

now
the
eldest
of
his
sons
he
took
not
with
him
and
his
name
was
helaman
but
the
names
of
those
whom
he
took
with
him
were
shiblon
and
corianton
and
these
are
the
names
of
those
who
went
with
him
among
the
zoramites
to
preach
unto
them
the
word

now
the
zoramites
were
dissenters
from
the
nephites
therefore
they
had
had
the
word
of
god
preached
unto
them

but
they
had
fallen
into
great
errors
for
they
would
not
observe
to
keep
the
commandments
of
god
and
his
statutes
according
to
the
law
of
moses

neither
would
they
observe
the
performances
of
the
church
to
continue
in
prayer
and
supplication
to
god
daily
that
they
might
not
enter
into
temptation

yea
in
fine
they
did
pervert
the
ways
of
the
lord
in
very
many
instances
therefore
for
this
cause
alma
and
his
brethren
went
into
the
land
to
preach
the
word
unto
them

now
when
they
had
come
into
the
land
behold
to
their
astonishment
they
found
that
the
zoramites
had
built
synagogues
and
that
they
did
gather
themselves
together
on
one
day
of
the
week
which
day
they
did
call
the
day
of
the
lord
and
they
did
worship
after
a
manner
which
alma
and
his
brethren
had
never
beheld

for
they
had
a
place
built
up
in
the
center
of
their
synagogue
a
place
for
standing
which
was
high
above
the
head
and
the
top
thereof
would
only
admit
one
person

therefore
whosoever
desired
to
worship
must
go
forth
and
stand
upon
the
top
thereof
and
stretch
forth
his
hands
towards
heaven
and
cry
with
a
loud
voice
saying

holy
holy
god
we
believe
that
thou
art
god
and
we
believe
that
thou
art
holy
and
that
thou
wast
a
spirit
and
that
thou
art
a
spirit
and
that
thou
wilt
be
a
spirit
forever

holy
god
we
believe
that
thou
hast
separated
us
from
our
brethren
and
we
do
not
believe
in
the
tradition
of
our
brethren
which
was
handed
down
to
them
by
the
childishness
of
their
fathers
but
we
believe
that
thou
hast
elected
us
to
be
thy
holy
children
and
also
thou
hast
made
it
known
unto
us
that
there
shall
be
no
christ

but
thou
art
the
same
yesterday
today
and
forever
and
thou
hast
elected
us
that
we
shall
be
saved
whilst
all
around
us
are
elected
to
be
cast
by
thy
wrath
down
to
hell
for
the
which
holiness
o
god
we
thank
thee
and
we
also
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
elected
us
that
we
may
not
be
led
away
after
the
foolish
traditions
of
our
brethren
which
doth
bind
them
down
to
a
belief
of
christ
which
doth
lead
their
hearts
to
wander
far
from
thee
our
god

and
again
we
thank
thee
o
god
that
we
are
a
chosen
and
a
holy
people
amen

now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
alma
and
his
brethren
and
his
sons
had
heard
these
prayers
they
were
astonished
beyond
all
measure

for
behold
every
man
did
go
forth
and
offer
up
these
same
prayers

now
the
place
was
called
by
them
rameumptom
which
being
interpreted
is
the
holy
stand

now
from
this
stand
they
did
offer
up
every
man
the
selfsame
prayer
unto
god
thanking
their
god
that
they
were
chosen
of
him
and
that
he
did
not
lead
them
away
after
the
tradition
of
their
brethren
and
that
their
hearts
were
not
stolen
away
to
believe
in
things
to
come
which
they
knew
nothing
about

now
after
the
people
had
all
offered
up
thanks
after
this
manner
they
returned
to
their
homes
never
speaking
of
their
god
again
until
they
had
assembled
themselves
together
again
to
the
holy
stand
to
offer
up
thanks
after
their
manner

now
when
alma
saw
this
his
heart
was
grieved
for
he
saw
that
they
were
a
wicked
and
a
perverse
people
yea
he
saw
that
their
hearts
were
set
upon
gold
and
upon
silver
and
upon
all
manner
of
fine
goods

yea
and
he
also
saw
that
their
hearts
were
lifted
up
unto
great
boasting
in
their
pride

and
he
lifted
up
his
voice
to
heaven
and
cried
saying
o
how
long
o
lord
wilt
thou
suffer
that
thy
servants
shall
dwell
here
below
in
the
flesh
to
behold
such
gross
wickedness
among
the
children
of
men

behold
o
god
they
cry
unto
thee
and
yet
their
hearts
are
swallowed
up
in
their
pride
behold
o
god
they
cry
unto
thee
with
their
mouths
while
they
are
puffed
up
even
to
greatness
with
the
vain
things
of
the
world

behold
o
my
god
their
costly
apparel
and
their
ringlets
and
their
bracelets
and
their
ornaments
of
gold
and
all
their
precious
things
which
they
are
ornamented
with
and
behold
their
hearts
are
set
upon
them
and
yet
they
cry
unto
thee
and
saywe
thank
thee
o
god
for
we
are
a
chosen
people
unto
thee
while
others
shall
perish

yea
and
they
say
that
thou
hast
made
it
known
unto
them
that
there
shall
be
no
christ

o
lord
god
how
long
wilt
thou
suffer
that
such
wickedness
and
infidelity
shall
be
among
this
people
o
lord
wilt
thou
give
me
strength
that
i
may
bear
with
mine
infirmities
for
i
am
infirm
and
such
wickedness
among
this
people
doth
pain
my
soul

o
lord
my
heart
is
exceedingly
sorrowful
wilt
thou
comfort
my
soul
in
christ
o
lord
wilt
thou
grant
unto
me
that
i
may
have
strength
that
i
may
suffer
with
patience
these
afflictions
which
shall
come
upon
me
because
of
the
iniquity
of
this
people

o
lord
wilt
thou
comfort
my
soul
and
give
unto
me
success
and
also
my
fellow
laborers
who
are
with
meyea
ammon
and
aaron
and
omner
and
also
amulek
and
zeezrom
and
also
my
two
sonsyea
even
all
these
wilt
thou
comfort
o
lord
yea
wilt
thou
comfort
their
souls
in
christ

wilt
thou
grant
unto
them
that
they
may
have
strength
that
they
may
bear
their
afflictions
which
shall
come
upon
them
because
of
the
iniquities
of
this
people

o
lord
wilt
thou
grant
unto
us
that
we
may
have
success
in
bringing
them
again
unto
thee
in
christ

behold
o
lord
their
souls
are
precious
and
many
of
them
are
our
brethren
therefore
give
unto
us
o
lord
power
and
wisdom
that
we
may
bring
these
our
brethren
again
unto
thee

now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
alma
had
said
these
words
that
he
clapped
his
hands
upon
all
them
who
were
with
him
and
behold
as
he
clapped
his
hands
upon
them
they
were
filled
with
the
holy
spirit

and
after
that
they
did
separate
themselves
one
from
another
taking
no
thought
for
themselves
what
they
should
eat
or
what
they
should
drink
or
what
they
should
put
on

and
the
lord
provided
for
them
that
they
should
hunger
not
neither
should
they
thirst
yea
and
he
also
gave
them
strength
that
they
should
suffer
no
manner
of
afflictions
save
it
were
swallowed
up
in
the
joy
of
christ
now
this
was
according
to
the
prayer
of
alma
and
this
because
he
prayed
in
faith
alma
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
go
forth
and
began
to
preach
the
word
of
god
unto
the
people
entering
into
their
synagogues
and
into
their
houses
yea
and
even
they
did
preach
the
word
in
their
streets

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
much
labor
among
them
they
began
to
have
success
among
the
poor
class
of
people
for
behold
they
were
cast
out
of
the
synagogues
because
of
the
coarseness
of
their
apparel

therefore
they
were
not
permitted
to
enter
into
their
synagogues
to
worship
god
being
esteemed
as
filthiness
therefore
they
were
poor
yea
they
were
esteemed
by
their
brethren
as
dross
therefore
they
were
poor
as
to
things
of
the
world
and
also
they
were
poor
in
heart

now
as
alma
was
teaching
and
speaking
unto
the
people
upon
the
hill
onidah
there
came
a
great
multitude
unto
him
who
were
those
of
whom
we
have
been
speaking
of
whom
were
poor
in
heart
because
of
their
poverty
as
to
the
things
of
the
world

and
they
came
unto
alma
and
the
one
who
was
the
foremost
among
them
said
unto
him
behold
what
shall
these
my
brethren
do
for
they
are
despised
of
all
men
because
of
their
poverty
yea
and
more
especially
by
our
priests
for
they
have
cast
us
out
of
our
synagogues
which
we
have
labored
abundantly
to
build
with
our
own
hands
and
they
have
cast
us
out
because
of
our
exceeding
poverty
and
we
have
no
place
to
worship
our
god
and
behold
what
shall
we
do

and
now
when
alma
heard
this
he
turned
him
about
his
face
immediately
towards
him
and
he
beheld
with
great
joy
for
he
beheld
that
their
afflictions
had
truly
humbled
them
and
that
they
were
in
a
preparation
to
hear
the
word

therefore
he
did
say
no
more
to
the
other
multitude
but
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
cried
unto
those
whom
he
beheld
who
were
truly
penitent
and
said
unto
them

i
behold
that
ye
are
lowly
in
heart
and
if
so
blessed
are
ye

behold
thy
brother
hath
said
what
shall
we
dofor
we
are
cast
out
of
our
synagogues
that
we
cannot
worship
our
god

behold
i
say
unto
you
do
ye
suppose
that
ye
cannot
worship
god
save
it
be
in
your
synagogues
only

moreover
i
would
ask
do
ye
suppose
that
ye
must
not
worship
god
only
once
in
a
week

i
say
unto
you
it
is
well
that
ye
are
cast
out
of
your
synagogues
that
ye
may
be
humble
and
that
ye
may
learn
wisdom
for
it
is
necessary
that
ye
should
learn
wisdom
for
it
is
because
that
ye
are
cast
out
that
ye
are
despised
of
your
brethren
because
of
your
exceeding
poverty
that
ye
are
brought
to
a
lowliness
of
heart
for
ye
are
necessarily
brought
to
be
humble

and
now
because
ye
are
compelled
to
be
humble
blessed
are
ye
for
a
man
sometimes
if
he
is
compelled
to
be
humble
seeketh
repentance
and
now
surely
whosoever
repenteth
shall
find
mercy
and
he
that
findeth
mercy
and
endureth
to
the
end
the
same
shall
be
saved

and
now
as
i
said
unto
you
that
because
ye
were
compelled
to
be
humble
ye
were
blessed
do
ye
not
suppose
that
they
are
more
blessed
who
truly
humble
themselves
because
of
the
word

yea
he
that
truly
humbleth
himself
and
repenteth
of
his
sins
and
endureth
to
the
end
the
same
shall
be
blessedyea
much
more
blessed
than
they
who
are
compelled
to
be
humble
because
of
their
exceeding
poverty

therefore
blessed
are
they
who
humble
themselves
without
being
compelled
to
be
humble
or
rather
in
other
words
blessed
is
he
that
believeth
in
the
word
of
god
and
is
baptized
without
stubbornness
of
heart
yea
without
being
brought
to
know
the
word
or
even
compelled
to
know
before
they
will
believe

yea
there
are
many
who
do
say
if
thou
wilt
show
unto
us
a
sign
from
heaven
then
we
shall
know
of
a
surety
then
we
shall
believe

now
i
ask
is
this
faith
behold
i
say
unto
you
nay
for
if
a
man
knoweth
a
thing
he
hath
no
cause
to
believe
for
he
knoweth
it

and
now
how
much
more
cursed
is
he
that
knoweth
the
will
of
god
and
doeth
it
not
than
he
that
only
believeth
or
only
hath
cause
to
believe
and
falleth
into
transgression

now
of
this
thing
ye
must
judge
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
it
is
on
the
one
hand
even
as
it
is
on
the
other
and
it
shall
be
unto
every
man
according
to
his
work

and
now
as
i
said
concerning
faithfaith
is
not
to
have
a
perfect
knowledge
of
things
therefore
if
ye
have
faith
ye
hope
for
things
which
are
not
seen
which
are
true

and
now
behold
i
say
unto
you
and
i
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
god
is
merciful
unto
all
who
believe
on
his
name
therefore
he
desireth
in
the
first
place
that
ye
should
believe
yea
even
on
his
word

and
now
he
imparteth
his
word
by
angels
unto
men
yea
not
only
men
but
women
also
now
this
is
not
all
little
children
do
have
words
given
unto
them
many
times
which
confound
the
wise
and
the
learned

and
now
my
beloved
brethren
as
ye
have
desired
to
know
of
me
what
ye
shall
do
because
ye
are
afflicted
and
cast
outnow
i
do
not
desire
that
ye
should
suppose
that
i
mean
to
judge
you
only
according
to
that
which
is
true

for
i
do
not
mean
that
ye
all
of
you
have
been
compelled
to
humble
yourselves
for
i
verily
believe
that
there
are
some
among
you
who
would
humble
themselves
let
them
be
in
whatsoever
circumstances
they
might

now
as
i
said
concerning
faiththat
it
was
not
a
perfect
knowledgeeven
so
it
is
with
my
words
ye
cannot
know
of
their
surety
at
first
unto
perfection
any
more
than
faith
is
a
perfect
knowledge

but
behold
if
ye
will
awake
and
arouse
your
faculties
even
to
an
experiment
upon
my
words
and
exercise
a
particle
of
faith
yea
even
if
ye
can
no
more
than
desire
to
believe
let
this
desire
work
in
you
even
until
ye
believe
in
a
manner
that
ye
can
give
place
for
a
portion
of
my
words

now
we
will
compare
the
word
unto
a
seed
now
if
ye
give
place
that
a
seed
may
be
planted
in
your
heart
behold
if
it
be
a
true
seed
or
a
good
seed
if
ye
do
not
cast
it
out
by
your
unbelief
that
ye
will
resist
the
spirit
of
the
lord
behold
it
will
begin
to
swell
within
your
breasts
and
when
you
feel
these
swelling
motions
ye
will
begin
to
say
within
yourselvesit
must
needs
be
that
this
is
a
good
seed
or
that
the
word
is
good
for
it
beginneth
to
enlarge
my
soul
yea
it
beginneth
to
enlighten
my
understanding
yea
it
beginneth
to
be
delicious
to
me

now
behold
would
not
this
increase
your
faith
i
say
unto
you
yea
nevertheless
it
hath
not
grown
up
to
a
perfect
knowledge

but
behold
as
the
seed
swelleth
and
sprouteth
and
beginneth
to
grow
then
you
must
needs
say
that
the
seed
is
good
for
behold
it
swelleth
and
sprouteth
and
beginneth
to
grow
and
now
behold
will
not
this
strengthen
your
faith
yea
it
will
strengthen
your
faith
for
ye
will
say
i
know
that
this
is
a
good
seed
for
behold
it
sprouteth
and
beginneth
to
grow

and
now
behold
are
ye
sure
that
this
is
a
good
seed
i
say
unto
you
yea
for
every
seed
bringeth
forth
unto
its
own
likeness

therefore
if
a
seed
groweth
it
is
good
but
if
it
groweth
not
behold
it
is
not
good
therefore
it
is
cast
away

and
now
behold
because
ye
have
tried
the
experiment
and
planted
the
seed
and
it
swelleth
and
sprouteth
and
beginneth
to
grow
ye
must
needs
know
that
the
seed
is
good

and
now
behold
is
your
knowledge
perfect
yea
your
knowledge
is
perfect
in
that
thing
and
your
faith
is
dormant
and
this
because
ye
know
for
ye
know
that
the
word
hath
swelled
your
souls
and
ye
also
know
that
it
hath
sprouted
up
that
your
understanding
doth
begin
to
be
enlightened
and
your
mind
doth
begin
to
expand

o
then
is
not
this
real
i
say
unto
you
yea
because
it
is
light
and
whatsoever
is
light
is
good
because
it
is
discernible
therefore
ye
must
know
that
it
is
good
and
now
behold
after
ye
have
tasted
this
light
is
your
knowledge
perfect

behold
i
say
unto
you
nay
neither
must
ye
lay
aside
your
faith
for
ye
have
only
exercised
your
faith
to
plant
the
seed
that
ye
might
try
the
experiment
to
know
if
the
seed
was
good

and
behold
as
the
tree
beginneth
to
grow
ye
will
say
let
us
nourish
it
with
great
care
that
it
may
get
root
that
it
may
grow
up
and
bring
forth
fruit
unto
us
and
now
behold
if
ye
nourish
it
with
much
care
it
will
get
root
and
grow
up
and
bring
forth
fruit

but
if
ye
neglect
the
tree
and
take
no
thought
for
its
nourishment
behold
it
will
not
get
any
root
and
when
the
heat
of
the
sun
cometh
and
scorcheth
it
because
it
hath
no
root
it
withers
away
and
ye
pluck
it
up
and
cast
it
out

now
this
is
not
because
the
seed
was
not
good
neither
is
it
because
the
fruit
thereof
would
not
be
desirable
but
it
is
because
your
ground
is
barren
and
ye
will
not
nourish
the
tree
therefore
ye
cannot
have
the
fruit
thereof

and
thus
if
ye
will
not
nourish
the
word
looking
forward
with
an
eye
of
faith
to
the
fruit
thereof
ye
can
never
pluck
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
life

but
if
ye
will
nourish
the
word
yea
nourish
the
tree
as
it
beginneth
to
grow
by
your
faith
with
great
diligence
and
with
patience
looking
forward
to
the
fruit
thereof
it
shall
take
root
and
behold
it
shall
be
a
tree
springing
up
unto
everlasting
life

and
because
of
your
diligence
and
your
faith
and
your
patience
with
the
word
in
nourishing
it
that
it
may
take
root
in
you
behold
by
and
by
ye
shall
pluck
the
fruit
thereof
which
is
most
precious
which
is
sweet
above
all
that
is
sweet
and
which
is
white
above
all
that
is
white
yea
and
pure
above
all
that
is
pure
and
ye
shall
feast
upon
this
fruit
even
until
ye
are
filled
that
ye
hunger
not
neither
shall
ye
thirst

then
my
brethren
ye
shall
reap
the
rewards
of
your
faith
and
your
diligence
and
patience
and
longsuffering
waiting
for
the
tree
to
bring
forth
fruit
unto
you
alma
chapter


now
after
alma
had
spoken
these
words
they
sent
forth
unto
him
desiring
to
know
whether
they
should
believe
in
one
god
that
they
might
obtain
this
fruit
of
which
he
had
spoken
or
how
they
should
plant
the
seed
or
the
word
of
which
he
had
spoken
which
he
said
must
be
planted
in
their
hearts
or
in
what
manner
they
should
begin
to
exercise
their
faith

and
alma
said
unto
them
behold
ye
have
said
that
ye
could
not
worship
your
god
because
ye
are
cast
out
of
your
synagogues
but
behold
i
say
unto
you
if
ye
suppose
that
ye
cannot
worship
god
ye
do
greatly
err
and
ye
ought
to
search
the
scriptures
if
ye
suppose
that
they
have
taught
you
this
ye
do
not
understand
them

do
ye
remember
to
have
read
what
zenos
the
prophet
of
old
has
said
concerning
prayer
or
worship

for
he
said
thou
art
merciful
o
god
for
thou
hast
heard
my
prayer
even
when
i
was
in
the
wilderness
yea
thou
wast
merciful
when
i
prayed
concerning
those
who
were
mine
enemies
and
thou
didst
turn
them
to
me

yea
o
god
and
thou
wast
merciful
unto
me
when
i
did
cry
unto
thee
in
my
field
when
i
did
cry
unto
thee
in
my
prayer
and
thou
didst
hear
me

and
again
o
god
when
i
did
turn
to
my
house
thou
didst
hear
me
in
my
prayer

and
when
i
did
turn
unto
my
closet
o
lord
and
prayed
unto
thee
thou
didst
hear
me

yea
thou
art
merciful
unto
thy
children
when
they
cry
unto
thee
to
be
heard
of
thee
and
not
of
men
and
thou
wilt
hear
them

yea
o
god
thou
hast
been
merciful
unto
me
and
heard
my
cries
in
the
midst
of
thy
congregations

yea
and
thou
hast
also
heard
me
when
i
have
been
cast
out
and
have
been
despised
by
mine
enemies
yea
thou
didst
hear
my
cries
and
wast
angry
with
mine
enemies
and
thou
didst
visit
them
in
thine
anger
with
speedy
destruction

and
thou
didst
hear
me
because
of
mine
afflictions
and
my
sincerity
and
it
is
because
of
thy
son
that
thou
hast
been
thus
merciful
unto
me
therefore
i
will
cry
unto
thee
in
all
mine
afflictions
for
in
thee
is
my
joy
for
thou
hast
turned
thy
judgments
away
from
me
because
of
thy
son

and
now
alma
said
unto
them
do
ye
believe
those
scriptures
which
have
been
written
by
them
of
old

behold
if
ye
do
ye
must
believe
what
zenos
said
for
behold
he
said
thou
hast
turned
away
thy
judgments
because
of
thy
son

now
behold
my
brethren
i
would
ask
if
ye
have
read
the
scriptures
if
ye
have
how
can
ye
disbelieve
on
the
son
of
god

for
it
is
not
written
that
zenos
alone
spake
of
these
things
but
zenock
also
spake
of
these
things

for
behold
he
said
thou
art
angry
o
lord
with
this
people
because
they
will
not
understand
thy
mercies
which
thou
hast
bestowed
upon
them
because
of
thy
son

and
now
my
brethren
ye
see
that
a
second
prophet
of
old
has
testified
of
the
son
of
god
and
because
the
people
would
not
understand
his
words
they
stoned
him
to
death

but
behold
this
is
not
all
these
are
not
the
only
ones
who
have
spoken
concerning
the
son
of
god

behold
he
was
spoken
of
by
moses
yea
and
behold
a
type
was
raised
up
in
the
wilderness
that
whosoever
would
look
upon
it
might
live
and
many
did
look
and
live

but
few
understood
the
meaning
of
those
things
and
this
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
but
there
were
many
who
were
so
hardened
that
they
would
not
look
therefore
they
perished
now
the
reason
they
would
not
look
is
because
they
did
not
believe
that
it
would
heal
them

o
my
brethren
if
ye
could
be
healed
by
merely
casting
about
your
eyes
that
ye
might
be
healed
would
ye
not
behold
quickly
or
would
ye
rather
harden
your
hearts
in
unbelief
and
be
slothful
that
ye
would
not
cast
about
your
eyes
that
ye
might
perish

if
so
wo
shall
come
upon
you
but
if
not
so
then
cast
about
your
eyes
and
begin
to
believe
in
the
son
of
god
that
he
will
come
to
redeem
his
people
and
that
he
shall
suffer
and
die
to
atone
for
their
sins
and
that
he
shall
rise
again
from
the
dead
which
shall
bring
to
pass
the
resurrection
that
all
men
shall
stand
before
him
to
be
judged
at
the
last
and
judgment
day
according
to
their
works

and
now
my
brethren
i
desire
that
ye
shall
plant
this
word
in
your
hearts
and
as
it
beginneth
to
swell
even
so
nourish
it
by
your
faith
and
behold
it
will
become
a
tree
springing
up
in
you
unto
everlasting
life
and
then
may
god
grant
unto
you
that
your
burdens
may
be
light
through
the
joy
of
his
son
and
even
all
this
can
ye
do
if
ye
will
amen
alma
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
alma
had
spoken
these
words
unto
them
he
sat
down
upon
the
ground
and
amulek
arose
and
began
to
teach
them
saying

my
brethren
i
think
that
it
is
impossible
that
ye
should
be
ignorant
of
the
things
which
have
been
spoken
concerning
the
coming
of
christ
who
is
taught
by
us
to
be
the
son
of
god
yea
i
know
that
these
things
were
taught
unto
you
bountifully
before
your
dissension
from
among
us

and
as
ye
have
desired
of
my
beloved
brother
that
he
should
make
known
unto
you
what
ye
should
do
because
of
your
afflictions
and
he
hath
spoken
somewhat
unto
you
to
prepare
your
minds
yea
and
he
hath
exhorted
you
unto
faith
and
to
patience

yea
even
that
ye
would
have
so
much
faith
as
even
to
plant
the
word
in
your
hearts
that
ye
may
try
the
experiment
of
its
goodness

and
we
have
beheld
that
the
great
question
which
is
in
your
minds
is
whether
the
word
be
in
the
son
of
god
or
whether
there
shall
be
no
christ

and
ye
also
beheld
that
my
brother
has
proved
unto
you
in
many
instances
that
the
word
is
in
christ
unto
salvation

my
brother
has
called
upon
the
words
of
zenos
that
redemption
cometh
through
the
son
of
god
and
also
upon
the
words
of
zenock
and
also
he
has
appealed
unto
moses
to
prove
that
these
things
are
true

and
now
behold
i
will
testify
unto
you
of
myself
that
these
things
are
true
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
i
do
know
that
christ
shall
come
among
the
children
of
men
to
take
upon
him
the
transgressions
of
his
people
and
that
he
shall
atone
for
the
sins
of
the
world
for
the
lord
god
hath
spoken
it

for
it
is
expedient
that
an
atonement
should
be
made
for
according
to
the
great
plan
of
the
eternal
god
there
must
be
an
atonement
made
or
else
all
mankind
must
unavoidably
perish
yea
all
are
hardened
yea
all
are
fallen
and
are
lost
and
must
perish
except
it
be
through
the
atonement
which
it
is
expedient
should
be
made

for
it
is
expedient
that
there
should
be
a
great
and
last
sacrifice
yea
not
a
sacrifice
of
man
neither
of
beast
neither
of
any
manner
of
fowl
for
it
shall
not
be
a
human
sacrifice
but
it
must
be
an
infinite
and
eternal
sacrifice

now
there
is
not
any
man
that
can
sacrifice
his
own
blood
which
will
atone
for
the
sins
of
another
now
if
a
man
murdereth
behold
will
our
law
which
is
just
take
the
life
of
his
brother
i
say
unto
you
nay

but
the
law
requireth
the
life
of
him
who
hath
murdered
therefore
there
can
be
nothing
which
is
short
of
an
infinite
atonement
which
will
suffice
for
the
sins
of
the
world

therefore
it
is
expedient
that
there
should
be
a
great
and
last
sacrifice
and
then
shall
there
be
or
it
is
expedient
there
should
be
a
stop
to
the
shedding
of
blood
then
shall
the
law
of
moses
be
fulfilled
yea
it
shall
be
all
fulfilled
every
jot
and
tittle
and
none
shall
have
passed
away

and
behold
this
is
the
whole
meaning
of
the
law
every
whit
pointing
to
that
great
and
last
sacrifice
and
that
great
and
last
sacrifice
will
be
the
son
of
god
yea
infinite
and
eternal

and
thus
he
shall
bring
salvation
to
all
those
who
shall
believe
on
his
name
this
being
the
intent
of
this
last
sacrifice
to
bring
about
the
bowels
of
mercy
which
overpowereth
justice
and
bringeth
about
means
unto
men
that
they
may
have
faith
unto
repentance

and
thus
mercy
can
satisfy
the
demands
of
justice
and
encircles
them
in
the
arms
of
safety
while
he
that
exercises
no
faith
unto
repentance
is
exposed
to
the
whole
law
of
the
demands
of
justice
therefore
only
unto
him
that
has
faith
unto
repentance
is
brought
about
the
great
and
eternal
plan
of
redemption

therefore
may
god
grant
unto
you
my
brethren
that
ye
may
begin
to
exercise
your
faith
unto
repentance
that
ye
begin
to
call
upon
his
holy
name
that
he
would
have
mercy
upon
you

yea
cry
unto
him
for
mercy
for
he
is
mighty
to
save

yea
humble
yourselves
and
continue
in
prayer
unto
him

cry
unto
him
when
ye
are
in
your
fields
yea
over
all
your
flocks

cry
unto
him
in
your
houses
yea
over
all
your
household
both
morning
midday
and
evening

yea
cry
unto
him
against
the
power
of
your
enemies

yea
cry
unto
him
against
the
devil
who
is
an
enemy
to
all
righteousness

cry
unto
him
over
the
crops
of
your
fields
that
ye
may
prosper
in
them

cry
over
the
flocks
of
your
fields
that
they
may
increase

but
this
is
not
all
ye
must
pour
out
your
souls
in
your
closets
and
your
secret
places
and
in
your
wilderness

yea
and
when
you
do
not
cry
unto
the
lord
let
your
hearts
be
full
drawn
out
in
prayer
unto
him
continually
for
your
welfare
and
also
for
the
welfare
of
those
who
are
around
you

and
now
behold
my
beloved
brethren
i
say
unto
you
do
not
suppose
that
this
is
all
for
after
ye
have
done
all
these
things
if
ye
turn
away
the
needy
and
the
naked
and
visit
not
the
sick
and
afflicted
and
impart
of
your
substance
if
ye
have
to
those
who
stand
in
needi
say
unto
you
if
ye
do
not
any
of
these
things
behold
your
prayer
is
vain
and
availeth
you
nothing
and
ye
are
as
hypocrites
who
do
deny
the
faith

therefore
if
ye
do
not
remember
to
be
charitable
ye
are
as
dross
which
the
refiners
do
cast
out
it
being
of
no
worth
and
is
trodden
under
foot
of
men

and
now
my
brethren
i
would
that
after
ye
have
received
so
many
witnesses
seeing
that
the
holy
scriptures
testify
of
these
things
ye
come
forth
and
bring
fruit
unto
repentance

yea
i
would
that
ye
would
come
forth
and
harden
not
your
hearts
any
longer
for
behold
now
is
the
time
and
the
day
of
your
salvation
and
therefore
if
ye
will
repent
and
harden
not
your
hearts
immediately
shall
the
great
plan
of
redemption
be
brought
about
unto
you

for
behold
this
life
is
the
time
for
men
to
prepare
to
meet
god
yea
behold
the
day
of
this
life
is
the
day
for
men
to
perform
their
labors

and
now
as
i
said
unto
you
before
as
ye
have
had
so
many
witnesses
therefore
i
beseech
of
you
that
ye
do
not
procrastinate
the
day
of
your
repentance
until
the
end
for
after
this
day
of
life
which
is
given
us
to
prepare
for
eternity
behold
if
we
do
not
improve
our
time
while
in
this
life
then
cometh
the
night
of
darkness
wherein
there
can
be
no
labor
performed

ye
cannot
say
when
ye
are
brought
to
that
awful
crisis
that
i
will
repent
that
i
will
return
to
my
god
nay
ye
cannot
say
this
for
that
same
spirit
which
doth
possess
your
bodies
at
the
time
that
ye
go
out
of
this
life
that
same
spirit
will
have
power
to
possess
your
body
in
that
eternal
world

for
behold
if
ye
have
procrastinated
the
day
of
your
repentance
even
until
death
behold
ye
have
become
subjected
to
the
spirit
of
the
devil
and
he
doth
seal
you
his
therefore
the
spirit
of
the
lord
hath
withdrawn
from
you
and
hath
no
place
in
you
and
the
devil
hath
all
power
over
you
and
this
is
the
final
state
of
the
wicked

and
this
i
know
because
the
lord
hath
said
he
dwelleth
not
in
unholy
temples
but
in
the
hearts
of
the
righteous
doth
he
dwell
yea
and
he
has
also
said
that
the
righteous
shall
sit
down
in
his
kingdom
to
go
no
more
out
but
their
garments
should
be
made
white
through
the
blood
of
the
lamb

and
now
my
beloved
brethren
i
desire
that
ye
should
remember
these
things
and
that
ye
should
work
out
your
salvation
with
fear
before
god
and
that
ye
should
no
more
deny
the
coming
of
christ

that
ye
contend
no
more
against
the
holy
ghost
but
that
ye
receive
it
and
take
upon
you
the
name
of
christ
that
ye
humble
yourselves
even
to
the
dust
and
worship
god
in
whatsoever
place
ye
may
be
in
in
spirit
and
in
truth
and
that
ye
live
in
thanksgiving
daily
for
the
many
mercies
and
blessings
which
he
doth
bestow
upon
you

yea
and
i
also
exhort
you
my
brethren
that
ye
be
watchful
unto
prayer
continually
that
ye
may
not
be
led
away
by
the
temptations
of
the
devil
that
he
may
not
overpower
you
that
ye
may
not
become
his
subjects
at
the
last
day
for
behold
he
rewardeth
you
no
good
thing

and
now
my
beloved
brethren
i
would
exhort
you
to
have
patience
and
that
ye
bear
with
all
manner
of
afflictions
that
ye
do
not
revile
against
those
who
do
cast
you
out
because
of
your
exceeding
poverty
lest
ye
become
sinners
like
unto
them

but
that
ye
have
patience
and
bear
with
those
afflictions
with
a
firm
hope
that
ye
shall
one
day
rest
from
all
your
afflictions
alma
chapter


now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
amulek
had
made
an
end
of
these
words
they
withdrew
themselves
from
the
multitude
and
came
over
into
the
land
of
jershon

yea
and
the
rest
of
the
brethren
after
they
had
preached
the
word
unto
the
zoramites
also
came
over
into
the
land
of
jershon

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
more
popular
part
of
the
zoramites
had
consulted
together
concerning
the
words
which
had
been
preached
unto
them
they
were
angry
because
of
the
word
for
it
did
destroy
their
craft
therefore
they
would
not
hearken
unto
the
words

and
they
sent
and
gathered
together
throughout
all
the
land
all
the
people
and
consulted
with
them
concerning
the
words
which
had
been
spoken

now
their
rulers
and
their
priests
and
their
teachers
did
not
let
the
people
know
concerning
their
desires
therefore
they
found
out
privily
the
minds
of
all
the
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
they
had
found
out
the
minds
of
all
the
people
those
who
were
in
favor
of
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
by
alma
and
his
brethren
were
cast
out
of
the
land
and
they
were
many
and
they
came
over
also
into
the
land
of
jershon

and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
and
his
brethren
did
minister
unto
them

now
the
people
of
the
zoramites
were
angry
with
the
people
of
ammon
who
were
in
jershon
and
the
chief
ruler
of
the
zoramites
being
a
very
wicked
man
sent
over
unto
the
people
of
ammon
desiring
them
that
they
should
cast
out
of
their
land
all
those
who
came
over
from
them
into
their
land

and
he
breathed
out
many
threatenings
against
them
and
now
the
people
of
ammon
did
not
fear
their
words
therefore
they
did
not
cast
them
out
but
they
did
receive
all
the
poor
of
the
zoramites
that
came
over
unto
them
and
they
did
nourish
them
and
did
clothe
them
and
did
give
unto
them
lands
for
their
inheritance
and
they
did
administer
unto
them
according
to
their
wants

now
this
did
stir
up
the
zoramites
to
anger
against
the
people
of
ammon
and
they
began
to
mix
with
the
lamanites
and
to
stir
them
up
also
to
anger
against
them

and
thus
the
zoramites
and
the
lamanites
began
to
make
preparations
for
war
against
the
people
of
ammon
and
also
against
the
nephites

and
thus
ended
the
seventeenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi

and
the
people
of
ammon
departed
out
of
the
land
of
jershon
and
came
over
into
the
land
of
melek
and
gave
place
in
the
land
of
jershon
for
the
armies
of
the
nephites
that
they
might
contend
with
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
and
the
armies
of
the
zoramites
and
thus
commenced
a
war
betwixt
the
lamanites
and
the
nephites
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
and
an
account
shall
be
given
of
their
wars
hereafter

and
alma
and
ammon
and
their
brethren
and
also
the
two
sons
of
alma
returned
to
the
land
of
zarahemla
after
having
been
instruments
in
the
hands
of
god
of
bringing
many
of
the
zoramites
to
repentance
and
as
many
as
were
brought
to
repentance
were
driven
out
of
their
land
but
they
have
lands
for
their
inheritance
in
the
land
of
jershon
and
they
have
taken
up
arms
to
defend
themselves
and
their
wives
and
children
and
their
lands

now
alma
being
grieved
for
the
iniquity
of
his
people
yea
for
the
wars
and
the
bloodsheds
and
the
contentions
which
were
among
them
and
having
been
to
declare
the
word
or
sent
to
declare
the
word
among
all
the
people
in
every
city
and
seeing
that
the
hearts
of
the
people
began
to
wax
hard
and
that
they
began
to
be
offended
because
of
the
strictness
of
the
word
his
heart
was
exceedingly
sorrowful

therefore
he
caused
that
his
sons
should
be
gathered
together
that
he
might
give
unto
them
every
one
his
charge
separately
concerning
the
things
pertaining
unto
righteousness
and
we
have
an
account
of
his
commandments
which
he
gave
unto
them
according
to
his
own
record
alma
chapter


my
son
give
ear
to
my
words
for
i
swear
unto
you
that
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
the
commandments
of
god
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
land

i
would
that
ye
should
do
as
i
have
done
in
remembering
the
captivity
of
our
fathers
for
they
were
in
bondage
and
none
could
deliver
them
except
it
was
the
god
of
abraham
and
the
god
of
isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
and
he
surely
did
deliver
them
in
their
afflictions

and
now
o
my
son
helaman
behold
thou
art
in
thy
youth
and
therefore
i
beseech
of
thee
that
thou
wilt
hear
my
words
and
learn
of
me
for
i
do
know
that
whosoever
shall
put
their
trust
in
god
shall
be
supported
in
their
trials
and
their
troubles
and
their
afflictions
and
shall
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day

and
i
would
not
that
ye
think
that
i
know
of
myselfnot
of
the
temporal
but
of
the
spiritual
not
of
the
carnal
mind
but
of
god

now
behold
i
say
unto
you
if
i
had
not
been
born
of
god
i
should
not
have
known
these
things
but
god
has
by
the
mouth
of
his
holy
angel
made
these
things
known
unto
me
not
of
any
worthiness
of
myself

for
i
went
about
with
the
sons
of
mosiah
seeking
to
destroy
the
church
of
god
but
behold
god
sent
his
holy
angel
to
stop
us
by
the
way

and
behold
he
spake
unto
us
as
it
were
the
voice
of
thunder
and
the
whole
earth
did
tremble
beneath
our
feet
and
we
all
fell
to
the
earth
for
the
fear
of
the
lord
came
upon
us

but
behold
the
voice
said
unto
me
arise
and
i
arose
and
stood
up
and
beheld
the
angel

and
he
said
unto
me
if
thou
wilt
of
thyself
be
destroyed
seek
no
more
to
destroy
the
church
of
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
fell
to
the
earth
and
it
was
for
the
space
of
three
days
and
three
nights
that
i
could
not
open
my
mouth
neither
had
i
the
use
of
my
limbs

and
the
angel
spake
more
things
unto
me
which
were
heard
by
my
brethren
but
i
did
not
hear
them
for
when
i
heard
the
wordsif
thou
wilt
be
destroyed
of
thyself
seek
no
more
to
destroy
the
church
of
godi
was
struck
with
such
great
fear
and
amazement
lest
perhaps
i
should
be
destroyed
that
i
fell
to
the
earth
and
i
did
hear
no
more

but
i
was
racked
with
eternal
torment
for
my
soul
was
harrowed
up
to
the
greatest
degree
and
racked
with
all
my
sins

yea
i
did
remember
all
my
sins
and
iniquities
for
which
i
was
tormented
with
the
pains
of
hell
yea
i
saw
that
i
had
rebelled
against
my
god
and
that
i
had
not
kept
his
holy
commandments

yea
and
i
had
murdered
many
of
his
children
or
rather
led
them
away
unto
destruction
yea
and
in
fine
so
great
had
been
my
iniquities
that
the
very
thought
of
coming
into
the
presence
of
my
god
did
rack
my
soul
with
inexpressible
horror

oh
thought
i
that
i
could
be
banished
and
become
extinct
both
soul
and
body
that
i
might
not
be
brought
to
stand
in
the
presence
of
my
god
to
be
judged
of
my
deeds

and
now
for
three
days
and
for
three
nights
was
i
racked
even
with
the
pains
of
a
damned
soul

and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
i
was
thus
racked
with
torment
while
i
was
harrowed
up
by
the
memory
of
my
many
sins
behold
i
remembered
also
to
have
heard
my
father
prophesy
unto
the
people
concerning
the
coming
of
one
jesus
christ
a
son
of
god
to
atone
for
the
sins
of
the
world

now
as
my
mind
caught
hold
upon
this
thought
i
cried
within
my
heart
o
jesus
thou
son
of
god
have
mercy
on
me
who
am
in
the
gall
of
bitterness
and
am
encircled
about
by
the
everlasting
chains
of
death

and
now
behold
when
i
thought
this
i
could
remember
my
pains
no
more
yea
i
was
harrowed
up
by
the
memory
of
my
sins
no
more

and
oh
what
joy
and
what
marvelous
light
i
did
behold
yea
my
soul
was
filled
with
joy
as
exceeding
as
was
my
pain

yea
i
say
unto
you
my
son
that
there
could
be
nothing
so
exquisite
and
so
bitter
as
were
my
pains
yea
and
again
i
say
unto
you
my
son
that
on
the
other
hand
there
can
be
nothing
so
exquisite
and
sweet
as
was
my
joy

yea
methought
i
saw
even
as
our
father
lehi
saw
god
sitting
upon
his
throne
surrounded
with
numberless
concourses
of
angels
in
the
attitude
of
singing
and
praising
their
god
yea
and
my
soul
did
long
to
be
there

but
behold
my
limbs
did
receive
their
strength
again
and
i
stood
upon
my
feet
and
did
manifest
unto
the
people
that
i
had
been
born
of
god

yea
and
from
that
time
even
until
now
i
have
labored
without
ceasing
that
i
might
bring
souls
unto
repentance
that
i
might
bring
them
to
taste
of
the
exceeding
joy
of
which
i
did
taste
that
they
might
also
be
born
of
god
and
be
filled
with
the
holy
ghost

yea
and
now
behold
o
my
son
the
lord
doth
give
me
exceedingly
great
joy
in
the
fruit
of
my
labors

for
because
of
the
word
which
he
has
imparted
unto
me
behold
many
have
been
born
of
god
and
have
tasted
as
i
have
tasted
and
have
seen
eye
to
eye
as
i
have
seen
therefore
they
do
know
of
these
things
of
which
i
have
spoken
as
i
do
know
and
the
knowledge
which
i
have
is
of
god

and
i
have
been
supported
under
trials
and
troubles
of
every
kind
yea
and
in
all
manner
of
afflictions
yea
god
has
delivered
me
from
prison
and
from
bonds
and
from
death
yea
and
i
do
put
my
trust
in
him
and
he
will
still
deliver
me

and
i
know
that
he
will
raise
me
up
at
the
last
day
to
dwell
with
him
in
glory
yea
and
i
will
praise
him
forever
for
he
has
brought
our
fathers
out
of
egypt
and
he
has
swallowed
up
the
egyptians
in
the
red
sea
and
he
led
them
by
his
power
into
the
promised
land
yea
and
he
has
delivered
them
out
of
bondage
and
captivity
from
time
to
time

yea
and
he
has
also
brought
our
fathers
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
he
has
also
by
his
everlasting
power
delivered
them
out
of
bondage
and
captivity
from
time
to
time
even
down
to
the
present
day
and
i
have
always
retained
in
remembrance
their
captivity
yea
and
ye
also
ought
to
retain
in
remembrance
as
i
have
done
their
captivity

but
behold
my
son
this
is
not
all
for
ye
ought
to
know
as
i
do
know
that
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
the
commandments
of
god
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
land
and
ye
ought
to
know
also
that
inasmuch
as
ye
will
not
keep
the
commandments
of
god
ye
shall
be
cut
off
from
his
presence
now
this
is
according
to
his
word
alma
chapter


and
now
my
son
helaman
i
command
you
that
ye
take
the
records
which
have
been
entrusted
with
me

and
i
also
command
you
that
ye
keep
a
record
of
this
people
according
as
i
have
done
upon
the
plates
of
nephi
and
keep
all
these
things
sacred
which
i
have
kept
even
as
i
have
kept
them
for
it
is
for
a
wise
purpose
that
they
are
kept

and
these
plates
of
brass
which
contain
these
engravings
which
have
the
records
of
the
holy
scriptures
upon
them
which
have
the
genealogy
of
our
forefathers
even
from
the
beginning

behold
it
has
been
prophesied
by
our
fathers
that
they
should
be
kept
and
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
another
and
be
kept
and
preserved
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
until
they
should
go
forth
unto
every
nation
kindred
tongue
and
people
that
they
shall
know
of
the
mysteries
contained
thereon

and
now
behold
if
they
are
kept
they
must
retain
their
brightness
yea
and
they
will
retain
their
brightness
yea
and
also
shall
all
the
plates
which
do
contain
that
which
is
holy
writ

now
ye
may
suppose
that
this
is
foolishness
in
me
but
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
by
small
and
simple
things
are
great
things
brought
to
pass
and
small
means
in
many
instances
doth
confound
the
wise

and
the
lord
god
doth
work
by
means
to
bring
about
his
great
and
eternal
purposes
and
by
very
small
means
the
lord
doth
confound
the
wise
and
bringeth
about
the
salvation
of
many
souls

and
now
it
has
hitherto
been
wisdom
in
god
that
these
things
should
be
preserved
for
behold
they
have
enlarged
the
memory
of
this
people
yea
and
convinced
many
of
the
error
of
their
ways
and
brought
them
to
the
knowledge
of
their
god
unto
the
salvation
of
their
souls

yea
i
say
unto
you
were
it
not
for
these
things
that
these
records
do
contain
which
are
on
these
plates
ammon
and
his
brethren
could
not
have
convinced
so
many
thousands
of
the
lamanites
of
the
incorrect
tradition
of
their
fathers
yea
these
records
and
their
words
brought
them
unto
repentance
that
is
they
brought
them
to
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
their
god
and
to
rejoice
in
jesus
christ
their
redeemer

and
who
knoweth
but
what
they
will
be
the
means
of
bringing
many
thousands
of
them
yea
and
also
many
thousands
of
our
stiffnecked
brethren
the
nephites
who
are
now
hardening
their
hearts
in
sin
and
iniquities
to
the
knowledge
of
their
redeemer

now
these
mysteries
are
not
yet
fully
made
known
unto
me
therefore
i
shall
forbear

and
it
may
suffice
if
i
only
say
they
are
preserved
for
a
wise
purpose
which
purpose
is
known
unto
god
for
he
doth
counsel
in
wisdom
over
all
his
works
and
his
paths
are
straight
and
his
course
is
one
eternal
round

o
remember
remember
my
son
helaman
how
strict
are
the
commandments
of
god
and
he
said
if
ye
will
keep
my
commandments
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
landbut
if
ye
keep
not
his
commandments
ye
shall
be
cut
off
from
his
presence

and
now
remember
my
son
that
god
has
entrusted
you
with
these
things
which
are
sacred
which
he
has
kept
sacred
and
also
which
he
will
keep
and
preserve
for
a
wise
purpose
in
him
that
he
may
show
forth
his
power
unto
future
generations

and
now
behold
i
tell
you
by
the
spirit
of
prophecy
that
if
ye
transgress
the
commandments
of
god
behold
these
things
which
are
sacred
shall
be
taken
away
from
you
by
the
power
of
god
and
ye
shall
be
delivered
up
unto
satan
that
he
may
sift
you
as
chaff
before
the
wind

but
if
ye
keep
the
commandments
of
god
and
do
with
these
things
which
are
sacred
according
to
that
which
the
lord
doth
command
you
for
you
must
appeal
unto
the
lord
for
all
things
whatsoever
ye
must
do
with
them
behold
no
power
of
earth
or
hell
can
take
them
from
you
for
god
is
powerful
to
the
fulfilling
of
all
his
words

for
he
will
fulfil
all
his
promises
which
he
shall
make
unto
you
for
he
has
fulfilled
his
promises
which
he
has
made
unto
our
fathers

for
he
promised
unto
them
that
he
would
preserve
these
things
for
a
wise
purpose
in
him
that
he
might
show
forth
his
power
unto
future
generations

and
now
behold
one
purpose
hath
he
fulfilled
even
to
the
restoration
of
many
thousands
of
the
lamanites
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
and
he
hath
shown
forth
his
power
in
them
and
he
will
also
still
show
forth
his
power
in
them
unto
future
generations
therefore
they
shall
be
preserved

therefore
i
command
you
my
son
helaman
that
ye
be
diligent
in
fulfilling
all
my
words
and
that
ye
be
diligent
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
god
as
they
are
written

and
now
i
will
speak
unto
you
concerning
those
twentyfour
plates
that
ye
keep
them
that
the
mysteries
and
the
works
of
darkness
and
their
secret
works
or
the
secret
works
of
those
people
who
have
been
destroyed
may
be
made
manifest
unto
this
people
yea
all
their
murders
and
robbings
and
their
plunderings
and
all
their
wickedness
and
abominations
may
be
made
manifest
unto
this
people
yea
and
that
ye
preserve
these
interpreters

for
behold
the
lord
saw
that
his
people
began
to
work
in
darkness
yea
work
secret
murders
and
abominations
therefore
the
lord
said
if
they
did
not
repent
they
should
be
destroyed
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth

and
the
lord
said
i
will
prepare
unto
my
servant
gazelem
a
stone
which
shall
shine
forth
in
darkness
unto
light
that
i
may
discover
unto
my
people
who
serve
me
that
i
may
discover
unto
them
the
works
of
their
brethren
yea
their
secret
works
their
works
of
darkness
and
their
wickedness
and
abominations

and
now
my
son
these
interpreters
were
prepared
that
the
word
of
god
might
be
fulfilled
which
he
spake
saying

i
will
bring
forth
out
of
darkness
unto
light
all
their
secret
works
and
their
abominations
and
except
they
repent
i
will
destroy
them
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
and
i
will
bring
to
light
all
their
secrets
and
abominations
unto
every
nation
that
shall
hereafter
possess
the
land

and
now
my
son
we
see
that
they
did
not
repent
therefore
they
have
been
destroyed
and
thus
far
the
word
of
god
has
been
fulfilled
yea
their
secret
abominations
have
been
brought
out
of
darkness
and
made
known
unto
us

and
now
my
son
i
command
you
that
ye
retain
all
their
oaths
and
their
covenants
and
their
agreements
in
their
secret
abominations
yea
and
all
their
signs
and
their
wonders
ye
shall
keep
from
this
people
that
they
know
them
not
lest
peradventure
they
should
fall
into
darkness
also
and
be
destroyed

for
behold
there
is
a
curse
upon
all
this
land
that
destruction
shall
come
upon
all
those
workers
of
darkness
according
to
the
power
of
god
when
they
are
fully
ripe
therefore
i
desire
that
this
people
might
not
be
destroyed

therefore
ye
shall
keep
these
secret
plans
of
their
oaths
and
their
covenants
from
this
people
and
only
their
wickedness
and
their
murders
and
their
abominations
shall
ye
make
known
unto
them
and
ye
shall
teach
them
to
abhor
such
wickedness
and
abominations
and
murders
and
ye
shall
also
teach
them
that
these
people
were
destroyed
on
account
of
their
wickedness
and
abominations
and
their
murders

for
behold
they
murdered
all
the
prophets
of
the
lord
who
came
among
them
to
declare
unto
them
concerning
their
iniquities
and
the
blood
of
those
whom
they
murdered
did
cry
unto
the
lord
their
god
for
vengeance
upon
those
who
were
their
murderers
and
thus
the
judgments
of
god
did
come
upon
these
workers
of
darkness
and
secret
combinations

yea
and
cursed
be
the
land
forever
and
ever
unto
those
workers
of
darkness
and
secret
combinations
even
unto
destruction
except
they
repent
before
they
are
fully
ripe

and
now
my
son
remember
the
words
which
i
have
spoken
unto
you
trust
not
those
secret
plans
unto
this
people
but
teach
them
an
everlasting
hatred
against
sin
and
iniquity

preach
unto
them
repentance
and
faith
on
the
lord
jesus
christ
teach
them
to
humble
themselves
and
to
be
meek
and
lowly
in
heart
teach
them
to
withstand
every
temptation
of
the
devil
with
their
faith
on
the
lord
jesus
christ

teach
them
to
never
be
weary
of
good
works
but
to
be
meek
and
lowly
in
heart
for
such
shall
find
rest
to
their
souls

o
remember
my
son
and
learn
wisdom
in
thy
youth
yea
learn
in
thy
youth
to
keep
the
commandments
of
god

yea
and
cry
unto
god
for
all
thy
support
yea
let
all
thy
doings
be
unto
the
lord
and
whithersoever
thou
goest
let
it
be
in
the
lord
yea
let
all
thy
thoughts
be
directed
unto
the
lord
yea
let
the
affections
of
thy
heart
be
placed
upon
the
lord
forever

counsel
with
the
lord
in
all
thy
doings
and
he
will
direct
thee
for
good
yea
when
thou
liest
down
at
night
lie
down
unto
the
lord
that
he
may
watch
over
you
in
your
sleep
and
when
thou
risest
in
the
morning
let
thy
heart
be
full
of
thanks
unto
god
and
if
ye
do
these
things
ye
shall
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day

and
now
my
son
i
have
somewhat
to
say
concerning
the
thing
which
our
fathers
call
a
ball
or
directoror
our
fathers
called
it
liahona
which
is
being
interpreted
a
compass
and
the
lord
prepared
it

and
behold
there
cannot
any
man
work
after
the
manner
of
so
curious
a
workmanship
and
behold
it
was
prepared
to
show
unto
our
fathers
the
course
which
they
should
travel
in
the
wilderness

and
it
did
work
for
them
according
to
their
faith
in
god
therefore
if
they
had
faith
to
believe
that
god
could
cause
that
those
spindles
should
point
the
way
they
should
go
behold
it
was
done
therefore
they
had
this
miracle
and
also
many
other
miracles
wrought
by
the
power
of
god
day
by
day

nevertheless
because
those
miracles
were
worked
by
small
means
it
did
show
unto
them
marvelous
works
they
were
slothful
and
forgot
to
exercise
their
faith
and
diligence
and
then
those
marvelous
works
ceased
and
they
did
not
progress
in
their
journey

therefore
they
tarried
in
the
wilderness
or
did
not
travel
a
direct
course
and
were
afflicted
with
hunger
and
thirst
because
of
their
transgressions

and
now
my
son
i
would
that
ye
should
understand
that
these
things
are
not
without
a
shadow
for
as
our
fathers
were
slothful
to
give
heed
to
this
compass
now
these
things
were
temporal
they
did
not
prosper
even
so
it
is
with
things
which
are
spiritual

for
behold
it
is
as
easy
to
give
heed
to
the
word
of
christ
which
will
point
to
you
a
straight
course
to
eternal
bliss
as
it
was
for
our
fathers
to
give
heed
to
this
compass
which
would
point
unto
them
a
straight
course
to
the
promised
land

and
now
i
say
is
there
not
a
type
in
this
thing
for
just
as
surely
as
this
director
did
bring
our
fathers
by
following
its
course
to
the
promised
land
shall
the
words
of
christ
if
we
follow
their
course
carry
us
beyond
this
vale
of
sorrow
into
a
far
better
land
of
promise

o
my
son
do
not
let
us
be
slothful
because
of
the
easiness
of
the
way
for
so
was
it
with
our
fathers
for
so
was
it
prepared
for
them
that
if
they
would
look
they
might
live
even
so
it
is
with
us
the
way
is
prepared
and
if
we
will
look
we
may
live
forever

and
now
my
son
see
that
ye
take
care
of
these
sacred
things
yea
see
that
ye
look
to
god
and
live
go
unto
this
people
and
declare
the
word
and
be
sober
my
son
farewell
alma
chapter


my
son
give
ear
to
my
words
for
i
say
unto
you
even
as
i
said
unto
helaman
that
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
the
commandments
of
god
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
land
and
inasmuch
as
ye
will
not
keep
the
commandments
of
god
ye
shall
be
cut
off
from
his
presence

and
now
my
son
i
trust
that
i
shall
have
great
joy
in
you
because
of
your
steadiness
and
your
faithfulness
unto
god
for
as
you
have
commenced
in
your
youth
to
look
to
the
lord
your
god
even
so
i
hope
that
you
will
continue
in
keeping
his
commandments
for
blessed
is
he
that
endureth
to
the
end

i
say
unto
you
my
son
that
i
have
had
great
joy
in
thee
already
because
of
thy
faithfulness
and
thy
diligence
and
thy
patience
and
thy
longsuffering
among
the
people
of
the
zoramites

for
i
know
that
thou
wast
in
bonds
yea
and
i
also
know
that
thou
wast
stoned
for
the
words
sake
and
thou
didst
bear
all
these
things
with
patience
because
the
lord
was
with
thee
and
now
thou
knowest
that
the
lord
did
deliver
thee

and
now
my
son
shiblon
i
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
as
much
as
ye
shall
put
your
trust
in
god
even
so
much
ye
shall
be
delivered
out
of
your
trials
and
your
troubles
and
your
afflictions
and
ye
shall
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day

now
my
son
i
would
not
that
ye
should
think
that
i
know
these
things
of
myself
but
it
is
the
spirit
of
god
which
is
in
me
which
maketh
these
things
known
unto
me
for
if
i
had
not
been
born
of
god
i
should
not
have
known
these
things

but
behold
the
lord
in
his
great
mercy
sent
his
angel
to
declare
unto
me
that
i
must
stop
the
work
of
destruction
among
his
people
yea
and
i
have
seen
an
angel
face
to
face
and
he
spake
with
me
and
his
voice
was
as
thunder
and
it
shook
the
whole
earth

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
was
three
days
and
three
nights
in
the
most
bitter
pain
and
anguish
of
soul
and
never
until
i
did
cry
out
unto
the
lord
jesus
christ
for
mercy
did
i
receive
a
remission
of
my
sins
but
behold
i
did
cry
unto
him
and
i
did
find
peace
to
my
soul

and
now
my
son
i
have
told
you
this
that
ye
may
learn
wisdom
that
ye
may
learn
of
me
that
there
is
no
other
way
or
means
whereby
man
can
be
saved
only
in
and
through
christ
behold
he
is
the
life
and
the
light
of
the
world
behold
he
is
the
word
of
truth
and
righteousness

and
now
as
ye
have
begun
to
teach
the
word
even
so
i
would
that
ye
should
continue
to
teach
and
i
would
that
ye
would
be
diligent
and
temperate
in
all
things

see
that
ye
are
not
lifted
up
unto
pride
yea
see
that
ye
do
not
boast
in
your
own
wisdom
nor
of
your
much
strength

use
boldness
but
not
overbearance
and
also
see
that
ye
bridle
all
your
passions
that
ye
may
be
filled
with
love
see
that
ye
refrain
from
idleness

do
not
pray
as
the
zoramites
do
for
ye
have
seen
that
they
pray
to
be
heard
of
men
and
to
be
praised
for
their
wisdom

do
not
say
o
god
i
thank
thee
that
we
are
better
than
our
brethren
but
rather
say
o
lord
forgive
my
unworthiness
and
remember
my
brethren
in
mercyyea
acknowledge
your
unworthiness
before
god
at
all
times

and
may
the
lord
bless
your
soul
and
receive
you
at
the
last
day
into
his
kingdom
to
sit
down
in
peace
now
go
my
son
and
teach
the
word
unto
this
people
be
sober
my
son
farewell
alma
chapter


and
now
my
son
i
have
somewhat
more
to
say
unto
thee
than
what
i
said
unto
thy
brother
for
behold
have
ye
not
observed
the
steadiness
of
thy
brother
his
faithfulness
and
his
diligence
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
god
behold
has
he
not
set
a
good
example
for
thee

for
thou
didst
not
give
so
much
heed
unto
my
words
as
did
thy
brother
among
the
people
of
the
zoramites
now
this
is
what
i
have
against
thee
thou
didst
go
on
unto
boasting
in
thy
strength
and
thy
wisdom

and
this
is
not
all
my
son
thou
didst
do
that
which
was
grievous
unto
me
for
thou
didst
forsake
the
ministry
and
did
go
over
into
the
land
of
siron
among
the
borders
of
the
lamanites
after
the
harlot
isabel

yea
she
did
steal
away
the
hearts
of
many
but
this
was
no
excuse
for
thee
my
son
thou
shouldst
have
tended
to
the
ministry
wherewith
thou
wast
entrusted

know
ye
not
my
son
that
these
things
are
an
abomination
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
yea
most
abominable
above
all
sins
save
it
be
the
shedding
of
innocent
blood
or
denying
the
holy
ghost

for
behold
if
ye
deny
the
holy
ghost
when
it
once
has
had
place
in
you
and
ye
know
that
ye
deny
it
behold
this
is
a
sin
which
is
unpardonable
yea
and
whosoever
murdereth
against
the
light
and
knowledge
of
god
it
is
not
easy
for
him
to
obtain
forgiveness
yea
i
say
unto
you
my
son
that
it
is
not
easy
for
him
to
obtain
a
forgiveness

and
now
my
son
i
would
to
god
that
ye
had
not
been
guilty
of
so
great
a
crime
i
would
not
dwell
upon
your
crimes
to
harrow
up
your
soul
if
it
were
not
for
your
good

but
behold
ye
cannot
hide
your
crimes
from
god
and
except
ye
repent
they
will
stand
as
a
testimony
against
you
at
the
last
day

now
my
son
i
would
that
ye
should
repent
and
forsake
your
sins
and
go
no
more
after
the
lusts
of
your
eyes
but
cross
yourself
in
all
these
things
for
except
ye
do
this
ye
can
in
nowise
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
oh
remember
and
take
it
upon
you
and
cross
yourself
in
these
things

and
i
command
you
to
take
it
upon
you
to
counsel
with
your
elder
brothers
in
your
undertakings
for
behold
thou
art
in
thy
youth
and
ye
stand
in
need
to
be
nourished
by
your
brothers
and
give
heed
to
their
counsel

suffer
not
yourself
to
be
led
away
by
any
vain
or
foolish
thing
suffer
not
the
devil
to
lead
away
your
heart
again
after
those
wicked
harlots
behold
o
my
son
how
great
iniquity
ye
brought
upon
the
zoramites
for
when
they
saw
your
conduct
they
would
not
believe
in
my
words

and
now
the
spirit
of
the
lord
doth
say
unto
me
command
thy
children
to
do
good
lest
they
lead
away
the
hearts
of
many
people
to
destruction
therefore
i
command
you
my
son
in
the
fear
of
god
that
ye
refrain
from
your
iniquities

that
ye
turn
to
the
lord
with
all
your
mind
might
and
strength
that
ye
lead
away
the
hearts
of
no
more
to
do
wickedly
but
rather
return
unto
them
and
acknowledge
your
faults
and
that
wrong
which
ye
have
done

seek
not
after
riches
nor
the
vain
things
of
this
world
for
behold
you
cannot
carry
them
with
you

and
now
my
son
i
would
say
somewhat
unto
you
concerning
the
coming
of
christ
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
it
is
he
that
surely
shall
come
to
take
away
the
sins
of
the
world
yea
he
cometh
to
declare
glad
tidings
of
salvation
unto
his
people

and
now
my
son
this
was
the
ministry
unto
which
ye
were
called
to
declare
these
glad
tidings
unto
this
people
to
prepare
their
minds
or
rather
that
salvation
might
come
unto
them
that
they
may
prepare
the
minds
of
their
children
to
hear
the
word
at
the
time
of
his
coming

and
now
i
will
ease
your
mind
somewhat
on
this
subject
behold
you
marvel
why
these
things
should
be
known
so
long
beforehand
behold
i
say
unto
you
is
not
a
soul
at
this
time
as
precious
unto
god
as
a
soul
will
be
at
the
time
of
his
coming

is
it
not
as
necessary
that
the
plan
of
redemption
should
be
made
known
unto
this
people
as
well
as
unto
their
children

is
it
not
as
easy
at
this
time
for
the
lord
to
send
his
angel
to
declare
these
glad
tidings
unto
us
as
unto
our
children
or
as
after
the
time
of
his
coming
alma
chapter


now
my
son
here
is
somewhat
more
i
would
say
unto
thee
for
i
perceive
that
thy
mind
is
worried
concerning
the
resurrection
of
the
dead

behold
i
say
unto
you
that
there
is
no
resurrectionor
i
would
say
in
other
words
that
this
mortal
does
not
put
on
immortality
this
corruption
does
not
put
on
incorruptionuntil
after
the
coming
of
christ

behold
he
bringeth
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
but
behold
my
son
the
resurrection
is
not
yet
now
i
unfold
unto
you
a
mystery
nevertheless
there
are
many
mysteries
which
are
kept
that
no
one
knoweth
them
save
god
himself
but
i
show
unto
you
one
thing
which
i
have
inquired
diligently
of
god
that
i
might
knowthat
is
concerning
the
resurrection

behold
there
is
a
time
appointed
that
all
shall
come
forth
from
the
dead
now
when
this
time
cometh
no
one
knows
but
god
knoweth
the
time
which
is
appointed

now
whether
there
shall
be
one
time
or
a
second
time
or
a
third
time
that
men
shall
come
forth
from
the
dead
it
mattereth
not
for
god
knoweth
all
these
things
and
it
sufficeth
me
to
know
that
this
is
the
casethat
there
is
a
time
appointed
that
all
shall
rise
from
the
dead

now
there
must
needs
be
a
space
betwixt
the
time
of
death
and
the
time
of
the
resurrection

and
now
i
would
inquire
what
becometh
of
the
souls
of
men
from
this
time
of
death
to
the
time
appointed
for
the
resurrection

now
whether
there
is
more
than
one
time
appointed
for
men
to
rise
it
mattereth
not
for
all
do
not
die
at
once
and
this
mattereth
not
all
is
as
one
day
with
god
and
time
only
is
measured
unto
men

therefore
there
is
a
time
appointed
unto
men
that
they
shall
rise
from
the
dead
and
there
is
a
space
between
the
time
of
death
and
the
resurrection
and
now
concerning
this
space
of
time
what
becometh
of
the
souls
of
men
is
the
thing
which
i
have
inquired
diligently
of
the
lord
to
know
and
this
is
the
thing
of
which
i
do
know

and
when
the
time
cometh
when
all
shall
rise
then
shall
they
know
that
god
knoweth
all
the
times
which
are
appointed
unto
man

now
concerning
the
state
of
the
soul
between
death
and
the
resurrectionbehold
it
has
been
made
known
unto
me
by
an
angel
that
the
spirits
of
all
men
as
soon
as
they
are
departed
from
this
mortal
body
yea
the
spirits
of
all
men
whether
they
be
good
or
evil
are
taken
home
to
that
god
who
gave
them
life

and
then
shall
it
come
to
pass
that
the
spirits
of
those
who
are
righteous
are
received
into
a
state
of
happiness
which
is
called
paradise
a
state
of
rest
a
state
of
peace
where
they
shall
rest
from
all
their
troubles
and
from
all
care
and
sorrow

and
then
shall
it
come
to
pass
that
the
spirits
of
the
wicked
yea
who
are
evilfor
behold
they
have
no
part
nor
portion
of
the
spirit
of
the
lord
for
behold
they
chose
evil
works
rather
than
good
therefore
the
spirit
of
the
devil
did
enter
into
them
and
take
possession
of
their
houseand
these
shall
be
cast
out
into
outer
darkness
there
shall
be
weeping
and
wailing
and
gnashing
of
teeth
and
this
because
of
their
own
iniquity
being
led
captive
by
the
will
of
the
devil

now
this
is
the
state
of
the
souls
of
the
wicked
yea
in
darkness
and
a
state
of
awful
fearful
looking
for
the
fiery
indignation
of
the
wrath
of
god
upon
them
thus
they
remain
in
this
state
as
well
as
the
righteous
in
paradise
until
the
time
of
their
resurrection

now
there
are
some
that
have
understood
that
this
state
of
happiness
and
this
state
of
misery
of
the
soul
before
the
resurrection
was
a
first
resurrection
yea
i
admit
it
may
be
termed
a
resurrection
the
raising
of
the
spirit
or
the
soul
and
their
consignation
to
happiness
or
misery
according
to
the
words
which
have
been
spoken

and
behold
again
it
hath
been
spoken
that
there
is
a
first
resurrection
a
resurrection
of
all
those
who
have
been
or
who
are
or
who
shall
be
down
to
the
resurrection
of
christ
from
the
dead

now
we
do
not
suppose
that
this
first
resurrection
which
is
spoken
of
in
this
manner
can
be
the
resurrection
of
the
souls
and
their
consignation
to
happiness
or
misery
ye
cannot
suppose
that
this
is
what
it
meaneth

behold
i
say
unto
you
nay
but
it
meaneth
the
reuniting
of
the
soul
with
the
body
of
those
from
the
days
of
adam
down
to
the
resurrection
of
christ

now
whether
the
souls
and
the
bodies
of
those
of
whom
has
been
spoken
shall
all
be
reunited
at
once
the
wicked
as
well
as
the
righteous
i
do
not
say
let
it
suffice
that
i
say
that
they
all
come
forth
or
in
other
words
their
resurrection
cometh
to
pass
before
the
resurrection
of
those
who
die
after
the
resurrection
of
christ

now
my
son
i
do
not
say
that
their
resurrection
cometh
at
the
resurrection
of
christ
but
behold
i
give
it
as
my
opinion
that
the
souls
and
the
bodies
are
reunited
of
the
righteous
at
the
resurrection
of
christ
and
his
ascension
into
heaven

but
whether
it
be
at
his
resurrection
or
after
i
do
not
say
but
this
much
i
say
that
there
is
a
space
between
death
and
the
resurrection
of
the
body
and
a
state
of
the
soul
in
happiness
or
in
misery
until
the
time
which
is
appointed
of
god
that
the
dead
shall
come
forth
and
be
reunited
both
soul
and
body
and
be
brought
to
stand
before
god
and
be
judged
according
to
their
works

yea
this
bringeth
about
the
restoration
of
those
things
of
which
has
been
spoken
by
the
mouths
of
the
prophets

the
soul
shall
be
restored
to
the
body
and
the
body
to
the
soul
yea
and
every
limb
and
joint
shall
be
restored
to
its
body
yea
even
a
hair
of
the
head
shall
not
be
lost
but
all
things
shall
be
restored
to
their
proper
and
perfect
frame

and
now
my
son
this
is
the
restoration
of
which
has
been
spoken
by
the
mouths
of
the
prophets

and
then
shall
the
righteous
shine
forth
in
the
kingdom
of
god

but
behold
an
awful
death
cometh
upon
the
wicked
for
they
die
as
to
things
pertaining
to
things
of
righteousness
for
they
are
unclean
and
no
unclean
thing
can
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
but
they
are
cast
out
and
consigned
to
partake
of
the
fruits
of
their
labors
or
their
works
which
have
been
evil
and
they
drink
the
dregs
of
a
bitter
cup
alma
chapter


and
now
my
son
i
have
somewhat
to
say
concerning
the
restoration
of
which
has
been
spoken
for
behold
some
have
wrested
the
scriptures
and
have
gone
far
astray
because
of
this
thing
and
i
perceive
that
thy
mind
has
been
worried
also
concerning
this
thing
but
behold
i
will
explain
it
unto
thee

i
say
unto
thee
my
son
that
the
plan
of
restoration
is
requisite
with
the
justice
of
god
for
it
is
requisite
that
all
things
should
be
restored
to
their
proper
order
behold
it
is
requisite
and
just
according
to
the
power
and
resurrection
of
christ
that
the
soul
of
man
should
be
restored
to
its
body
and
that
every
part
of
the
body
should
be
restored
to
itself

and
it
is
requisite
with
the
justice
of
god
that
men
should
be
judged
according
to
their
works
and
if
their
works
were
good
in
this
life
and
the
desires
of
their
hearts
were
good
that
they
should
also
at
the
last
day
be
restored
unto
that
which
is
good

and
if
their
works
are
evil
they
shall
be
restored
unto
them
for
evil
therefore
all
things
shall
be
restored
to
their
proper
order
every
thing
to
its
natural
framemortality
raised
to
immortality
corruption
to
incorruptionraised
to
endless
happiness
to
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
or
to
endless
misery
to
inherit
the
kingdom
of
the
devil
the
one
on
one
hand
the
other
on
the
other

the
one
raised
to
happiness
according
to
his
desires
of
happiness
or
good
according
to
his
desires
of
good
and
the
other
to
evil
according
to
his
desires
of
evil
for
as
he
has
desired
to
do
evil
all
the
day
long
even
so
shall
he
have
his
reward
of
evil
when
the
night
cometh

and
so
it
is
on
the
other
hand
if
he
hath
repented
of
his
sins
and
desired
righteousness
until
the
end
of
his
days
even
so
he
shall
be
rewarded
unto
righteousness

these
are
they
that
are
redeemed
of
the
lord
yea
these
are
they
that
are
taken
out
that
are
delivered
from
that
endless
night
of
darkness
and
thus
they
stand
or
fall
for
behold
they
are
their
own
judges
whether
to
do
good
or
do
evil

now
the
decrees
of
god
are
unalterable
therefore
the
way
is
prepared
that
whosoever
will
may
walk
therein
and
be
saved

and
now
behold
my
son
do
not
risk
one
more
offense
against
your
god
upon
those
points
of
doctrine
which
ye
have
hitherto
risked
to
commit
sin

do
not
suppose
because
it
has
been
spoken
concerning
restoration
that
ye
shall
be
restored
from
sin
to
happiness
behold
i
say
unto
you
wickedness
never
was
happiness

and
now
my
son
all
men
that
are
in
a
state
of
nature
or
i
would
say
in
a
carnal
state
are
in
the
gall
of
bitterness
and
in
the
bonds
of
iniquity
they
are
without
god
in
the
world
and
they
have
gone
contrary
to
the
nature
of
god
therefore
they
are
in
a
state
contrary
to
the
nature
of
happiness

and
now
behold
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
restoration
to
take
a
thing
of
a
natural
state
and
place
it
in
an
unnatural
state
or
to
place
it
in
a
state
opposite
to
its
nature

o
my
son
this
is
not
the
case
but
the
meaning
of
the
word
restoration
is
to
bring
back
again
evil
for
evil
or
carnal
for
carnal
or
devilish
for
devilishgood
for
that
which
is
good
righteous
for
that
which
is
righteous
just
for
that
which
is
just
merciful
for
that
which
is
merciful

therefore
my
son
see
that
you
are
merciful
unto
your
brethren
deal
justly
judge
righteously
and
do
good
continually
and
if
ye
do
all
these
things
then
shall
ye
receive
your
reward
yea
ye
shall
have
mercy
restored
unto
you
again
ye
shall
have
justice
restored
unto
you
again
ye
shall
have
a
righteous
judgment
restored
unto
you
again
and
ye
shall
have
good
rewarded
unto
you
again

for
that
which
ye
do
send
out
shall
return
unto
you
again
and
be
restored
therefore
the
word
restoration
more
fully
condemneth
the
sinner
and
justifieth
him
not
at
all
alma
chapter


and
now
my
son
i
perceive
there
is
somewhat
more
which
doth
worry
your
mind
which
ye
cannot
understandwhich
is
concerning
the
justice
of
god
in
the
punishment
of
the
sinner
for
ye
do
try
to
suppose
that
it
is
injustice
that
the
sinner
should
be
consigned
to
a
state
of
misery

now
behold
my
son
i
will
explain
this
thing
unto
thee
for
behold
after
the
lord
god
sent
our
first
parents
forth
from
the
garden
of
eden
to
till
the
ground
from
whence
they
were
takenyea
he
drew
out
the
man
and
he
placed
at
the
east
end
of
the
garden
of
eden
cherubim
and
a
flaming
sword
which
turned
every
way
to
keep
the
tree
of
life

now
we
see
that
the
man
had
become
as
god
knowing
good
and
evil
and
lest
he
should
put
forth
his
hand
and
take
also
of
the
tree
of
life
and
eat
and
live
forever
the
lord
god
placed
cherubim
and
the
flaming
sword
that
he
should
not
partake
of
the
fruit

and
thus
we
see
that
there
was
a
time
granted
unto
man
to
repent
yea
a
probationary
time
a
time
to
repent
and
serve
god

for
behold
if
adam
had
put
forth
his
hand
immediately
and
partaken
of
the
tree
of
life
he
would
have
lived
forever
according
to
the
word
of
god
having
no
space
for
repentance
yea
and
also
the
word
of
god
would
have
been
void
and
the
great
plan
of
salvation
would
have
been
frustrated

but
behold
it
was
appointed
unto
man
to
dietherefore
as
they
were
cut
off
from
the
tree
of
life
they
should
be
cut
off
from
the
face
of
the
earthand
man
became
lost
forever
yea
they
became
fallen
man

and
now
ye
see
by
this
that
our
first
parents
were
cut
off
both
temporally
and
spiritually
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
thus
we
see
they
became
subjects
to
follow
after
their
own
will

now
behold
it
was
not
expedient
that
man
should
be
reclaimed
from
this
temporal
death
for
that
would
destroy
the
great
plan
of
happiness

therefore
as
the
soul
could
never
die
and
the
fall
had
brought
upon
all
mankind
a
spiritual
death
as
well
as
a
temporal
that
is
they
were
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
it
was
expedient
that
mankind
should
be
reclaimed
from
this
spiritual
death

therefore
as
they
had
become
carnal
sensual
and
devilish
by
nature
this
probationary
state
became
a
state
for
them
to
prepare
it
became
a
preparatory
state

and
now
remember
my
son
if
it
were
not
for
the
plan
of
redemption
laying
it
aside
as
soon
as
they
were
dead
their
souls
were
miserable
being
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord

and
now
there
was
no
means
to
reclaim
men
from
this
fallen
state
which
man
had
brought
upon
himself
because
of
his
own
disobedience

therefore
according
to
justice
the
plan
of
redemption
could
not
be
brought
about
only
on
conditions
of
repentance
of
men
in
this
probationary
state
yea
this
preparatory
state
for
except
it
were
for
these
conditions
mercy
could
not
take
effect
except
it
should
destroy
the
work
of
justice
now
the
work
of
justice
could
not
be
destroyed
if
so
god
would
cease
to
be
god

and
thus
we
see
that
all
mankind
were
fallen
and
they
were
in
the
grasp
of
justice
yea
the
justice
of
god
which
consigned
them
forever
to
be
cut
off
from
his
presence

and
now
the
plan
of
mercy
could
not
be
brought
about
except
an
atonement
should
be
made
therefore
god
himself
atoneth
for
the
sins
of
the
world
to
bring
about
the
plan
of
mercy
to
appease
the
demands
of
justice
that
god
might
be
a
perfect
just
god
and
a
merciful
god
also

now
repentance
could
not
come
unto
men
except
there
were
a
punishment
which
also
was
eternal
as
the
life
of
the
soul
should
be
affixed
opposite
to
the
plan
of
happiness
which
was
as
eternal
also
as
the
life
of
the
soul

now
how
could
a
man
repent
except
he
should
sin
how
could
he
sin
if
there
was
no
law
how
could
there
be
a
law
save
there
was
a
punishment

now
there
was
a
punishment
affixed
and
a
just
law
given
which
brought
remorse
of
conscience
unto
man

now
if
there
was
no
law
givenif
a
man
murdered
he
should
diewould
he
be
afraid
he
would
die
if
he
should
murder

and
also
if
there
was
no
law
given
against
sin
men
would
not
be
afraid
to
sin

and
if
there
was
no
law
given
if
men
sinned
what
could
justice
do
or
mercy
either
for
they
would
have
no
claim
upon
the
creature

but
there
is
a
law
given
and
a
punishment
affixed
and
a
repentance
granted
which
repentance
mercy
claimeth
otherwise
justice
claimeth
the
creature
and
executeth
the
law
and
the
law
inflicteth
the
punishment
if
not
so
the
works
of
justice
would
be
destroyed
and
god
would
cease
to
be
god

but
god
ceaseth
not
to
be
god
and
mercy
claimeth
the
penitent
and
mercy
cometh
because
of
the
atonement
and
the
atonement
bringeth
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
bringeth
back
men
into
the
presence
of
god
and
thus
they
are
restored
into
his
presence
to
be
judged
according
to
their
works
according
to
the
law
and
justice

for
behold
justice
exerciseth
all
his
demands
and
also
mercy
claimeth
all
which
is
her
own
and
thus
none
but
the
truly
penitent
are
saved

what
do
ye
suppose
that
mercy
can
rob
justice
i
say
unto
you
nay
not
one
whit
if
so
god
would
cease
to
be
god

and
thus
god
bringeth
about
his
great
and
eternal
purposes
which
were
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
and
thus
cometh
about
the
salvation
and
the
redemption
of
men
and
also
their
destruction
and
misery

therefore
o
my
son
whosoever
will
come
may
come
and
partake
of
the
waters
of
life
freely
and
whosoever
will
not
come
the
same
is
not
compelled
to
come
but
in
the
last
day
it
shall
be
restored
unto
him
according
to
his
deeds

if
he
has
desired
to
do
evil
and
has
not
repented
in
his
days
behold
evil
shall
be
done
unto
him
according
to
the
restoration
of
god

and
now
my
son
i
desire
that
ye
should
let
these
things
trouble
you
no
more
and
only
let
your
sins
trouble
you
with
that
trouble
which
shall
bring
you
down
unto
repentance

o
my
son
i
desire
that
ye
should
deny
the
justice
of
god
no
more
do
not
endeavor
to
excuse
yourself
in
the
least
point
because
of
your
sins
by
denying
the
justice
of
god
but
do
you
let
the
justice
of
god
and
his
mercy
and
his
longsuffering
have
full
sway
in
your
heart
and
let
it
bring
you
down
to
the
dust
in
humility

and
now
o
my
son
ye
are
called
of
god
to
preach
the
word
unto
this
people
and
now
my
son
go
thy
way
declare
the
word
with
truth
and
soberness
that
thou
mayest
bring
souls
unto
repentance
that
the
great
plan
of
mercy
may
have
claim
upon
them
and
may
god
grant
unto
you
even
according
to
my
words
amen
alma
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
sons
of
alma
did
go
forth
among
the
people
to
declare
the
word
unto
them
and
alma
also
himself
could
not
rest
and
he
also
went
forth

now
we
shall
say
no
more
concerning
their
preaching
except
that
they
preached
the
word
and
the
truth
according
to
the
spirit
of
prophecy
and
revelation
and
they
preached
after
the
holy
order
of
god
by
which
they
were
called

and
now
i
return
to
an
account
of
the
wars
between
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges

for
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
the
zoramites
became
lamanites
therefore
in
the
commencement
of
the
eighteenth
year
the
people
of
the
nephites
saw
that
the
lamanites
were
coming
upon
them
therefore
they
made
preparations
for
war
yea
they
gathered
together
their
armies
in
the
land
of
jershon

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
came
with
their
thousands
and
they
came
into
the
land
of
antionum
which
is
the
land
of
the
zoramites
and
a
man
by
the
name
of
zerahemnah
was
their
leader

and
now
as
the
amalekites
were
of
a
more
wicked
and
murderous
disposition
than
the
lamanites
were
in
and
of
themselves
therefore
zerahemnah
appointed
chief
captains
over
the
lamanites
and
they
were
all
amalekites
and
zoramites

now
this
he
did
that
he
might
preserve
their
hatred
towards
the
nephites
that
he
might
bring
them
into
subjection
to
the
accomplishment
of
his
designs

for
behold
his
designs
were
to
stir
up
the
lamanites
to
anger
against
the
nephites
this
he
did
that
he
might
usurp
great
power
over
them
and
also
that
he
might
gain
power
over
the
nephites
by
bringing
them
into
bondage

and
now
the
design
of
the
nephites
was
to
support
their
lands
and
their
houses
and
their
wives
and
their
children
that
they
might
preserve
them
from
the
hands
of
their
enemies
and
also
that
they
might
preserve
their
rights
and
their
privileges
yea
and
also
their
liberty
that
they
might
worship
god
according
to
their
desires

for
they
knew
that
if
they
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
lamanites
that
whosoever
should
worship
god
in
spirit
and
in
truth
the
true
and
the
living
god
the
lamanites
would
destroy

yea
and
they
also
knew
the
extreme
hatred
of
the
lamanites
towards
their
brethren
who
were
the
people
of
antinephilehi
who
were
called
the
people
of
ammonand
they
would
not
take
up
arms
yea
they
had
entered
into
a
covenant
and
they
would
not
break
ittherefore
if
they
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
lamanites
they
would
be
destroyed

and
the
nephites
would
not
suffer
that
they
should
be
destroyed
therefore
they
gave
them
lands
for
their
inheritance

and
the
people
of
ammon
did
give
unto
the
nephites
a
large
portion
of
their
substance
to
support
their
armies
and
thus
the
nephites
were
compelled
alone
to
withstand
against
the
lamanites
who
were
a
compound
of
laman
and
lemuel
and
the
sons
of
ishmael
and
all
those
who
had
dissented
from
the
nephites
who
were
amalekites
and
zoramites
and
the
descendants
of
the
priests
of
noah

now
those
descendants
were
as
numerous
nearly
as
were
the
nephites
and
thus
the
nephites
were
obliged
to
contend
with
their
brethren
even
unto
bloodshed

and
it
came
to
pass
as
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
had
gathered
together
in
the
land
of
antionum
behold
the
armies
of
the
nephites
were
prepared
to
meet
them
in
the
land
of
jershon

now
the
leader
of
the
nephites
or
the
man
who
had
been
appointed
to
be
the
chief
captain
over
the
nephitesnow
the
chief
captain
took
the
command
of
all
the
armies
of
the
nephitesand
his
name
was
moroni

and
moroni
took
all
the
command
and
the
government
of
their
wars
and
he
was
only
twenty
and
five
years
old
when
he
was
appointed
chief
captain
over
the
armies
of
the
nephites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
met
the
lamanites
in
the
borders
of
jershon
and
his
people
were
armed
with
swords
and
with
cimeters
and
all
manner
of
weapons
of
war

and
when
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
saw
that
the
people
of
nephi
or
that
moroni
had
prepared
his
people
with
breastplates
and
with
armshields
yea
and
also
shields
to
defend
their
heads
and
also
they
were
dressed
with
thick
clothing

now
the
army
of
zerahemnah
was
not
prepared
with
any
such
thing
they
had
only
their
swords
and
their
cimeters
their
bows
and
their
arrows
their
stones
and
their
slings
and
they
were
naked
save
it
were
a
skin
which
was
girded
about
their
loins
yea
all
were
naked
save
it
were
the
zoramites
and
the
amalekites

but
they
were
not
armed
with
breastplates
nor
shieldstherefore
they
were
exceedingly
afraid
of
the
armies
of
the
nephites
because
of
their
armor
notwithstanding
their
number
being
so
much
greater
than
the
nephites

behold
now
it
came
to
pass
that
they
durst
not
come
against
the
nephites
in
the
borders
of
jershon
therefore
they
departed
out
of
the
land
of
antionum
into
the
wilderness
and
took
their
journey
round
about
in
the
wilderness
away
by
the
head
of
the
river
sidon
that
they
might
come
into
the
land
of
manti
and
take
possession
of
the
land
for
they
did
not
suppose
that
the
armies
of
moroni
would
know
whither
they
had
gone

but
it
came
to
pass
as
soon
as
they
had
departed
into
the
wilderness
moroni
sent
spies
into
the
wilderness
to
watch
their
camp
and
moroni
also
knowing
of
the
prophecies
of
alma
sent
certain
men
unto
him
desiring
him
that
he
should
inquire
of
the
lord
whither
the
armies
of
the
nephites
should
go
to
defend
themselves
against
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
alma
and
alma
informed
the
messengers
of
moroni
that
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
were
marching
round
about
in
the
wilderness
that
they
might
come
over
into
the
land
of
manti
that
they
might
commence
an
attack
upon
the
weaker
part
of
the
people
and
those
messengers
went
and
delivered
the
message
unto
moroni

now
moroni
leaving
a
part
of
his
army
in
the
land
of
jershon
lest
by
any
means
a
part
of
the
lamanites
should
come
into
that
land
and
take
possession
of
the
city
took
the
remaining
part
of
his
army
and
marched
over
into
the
land
of
manti

and
he
caused
that
all
the
people
in
that
quarter
of
the
land
should
gather
themselves
together
to
battle
against
the
lamanites
to
defend
their
lands
and
their
country
their
rights
and
their
liberties
therefore
they
were
prepared
against
the
time
of
the
coming
of
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
caused
that
his
army
should
be
secreted
in
the
valley
which
was
near
the
bank
of
the
river
sidon
which
was
on
the
west
of
the
river
sidon
in
the
wilderness

and
moroni
placed
spies
round
about
that
he
might
know
when
the
camp
of
the
lamanites
should
come

and
now
as
moroni
knew
the
intention
of
the
lamanites
that
it
was
their
intention
to
destroy
their
brethren
or
to
subject
them
and
bring
them
into
bondage
that
they
might
establish
a
kingdom
unto
themselves
over
all
the
land

and
he
also
knowing
that
it
was
the
only
desire
of
the
nephites
to
preserve
their
lands
and
their
liberty
and
their
church
therefore
he
thought
it
no
sin
that
he
should
defend
them
by
stratagem
therefore
he
found
by
his
spies
which
course
the
lamanites
were
to
take

therefore
he
divided
his
army
and
brought
a
part
over
into
the
valley
and
concealed
them
on
the
east
and
on
the
south
of
the
hill
riplah

and
the
remainder
he
concealed
in
the
west
valley
on
the
west
of
the
river
sidon
and
so
down
into
the
borders
of
the
land
manti

and
thus
having
placed
his
army
according
to
his
desire
he
was
prepared
to
meet
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
came
up
on
the
north
of
the
hill
where
a
part
of
the
army
of
moroni
was
concealed

and
as
the
lamanites
had
passed
the
hill
riplah
and
came
into
the
valley
and
began
to
cross
the
river
sidon
the
army
which
was
concealed
on
the
south
of
the
hill
which
was
led
by
a
man
whose
name
was
lehi
and
he
led
his
army
forth
and
encircled
the
lamanites
about
on
the
east
in
their
rear

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
when
they
saw
the
nephites
coming
upon
them
in
their
rear
turned
them
about
and
began
to
contend
with
the
army
of
lehi

and
the
work
of
death
commenced
on
both
sides
but
it
was
more
dreadful
on
the
part
of
the
lamanites
for
their
nakedness
was
exposed
to
the
heavy
blows
of
the
nephites
with
their
swords
and
their
cimeters
which
brought
death
almost
at
every
stroke

while
on
the
other
hand
there
was
now
and
then
a
man
fell
among
the
nephites
by
their
swords
and
the
loss
of
blood
they
being
shielded
from
the
more
vital
parts
of
the
body
or
the
more
vital
parts
of
the
body
being
shielded
from
the
strokes
of
the
lamanites
by
their
breastplates
and
their
armshields
and
their
headplates
and
thus
the
nephites
did
carry
on
the
work
of
death
among
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
became
frightened
because
of
the
great
destruction
among
them
even
until
they
began
to
flee
towards
the
river
sidon

and
they
were
pursued
by
lehi
and
his
men
and
they
were
driven
by
lehi
into
the
waters
of
sidon
and
they
crossed
the
waters
of
sidon
and
lehi
retained
his
armies
upon
the
bank
of
the
river
sidon
that
they
should
not
cross

and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
and
his
army
met
the
lamanites
in
the
valley
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
sidon
and
began
to
fall
upon
them
and
to
slay
them

and
the
lamanites
did
flee
again
before
them
towards
the
land
of
manti
and
they
were
met
again
by
the
armies
of
moroni

now
in
this
case
the
lamanites
did
fight
exceedingly
yea
never
had
the
lamanites
been
known
to
fight
with
such
exceedingly
great
strength
and
courage
no
not
even
from
the
beginning

and
they
were
inspired
by
the
zoramites
and
the
amalekites
who
were
their
chief
captains
and
leaders
and
by
zerahemnah
who
was
their
chief
captain
or
their
chief
leader
and
commander
yea
they
did
fight
like
dragons
and
many
of
the
nephites
were
slain
by
their
hands
yea
for
they
did
smite
in
two
many
of
their
headplates
and
they
did
pierce
many
of
their
breastplates
and
they
did
smite
off
many
of
their
arms
and
thus
the
lamanites
did
smite
in
their
fierce
anger

nevertheless
the
nephites
were
inspired
by
a
better
cause
for
they
were
not
fighting
for
monarchy
nor
power
but
they
were
fighting
for
their
homes
and
their
liberties
their
wives
and
their
children
and
their
all
yea
for
their
rites
of
worship
and
their
church

and
they
were
doing
that
which
they
felt
was
the
duty
which
they
owed
to
their
god
for
the
lord
had
said
unto
them
and
also
unto
their
fathers
that
inasmuch
as
ye
are
not
guilty
of
the
first
offense
neither
the
second
ye
shall
not
suffer
yourselves
to
be
slain
by
the
hands
of
your
enemies

and
again
the
lord
has
said
that
ye
shall
defend
your
families
even
unto
bloodshed
therefore
for
this
cause
were
the
nephites
contending
with
the
lamanites
to
defend
themselves
and
their
families
and
their
lands
their
country
and
their
rights
and
their
religion

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
men
of
moroni
saw
the
fierceness
and
the
anger
of
the
lamanites
they
were
about
to
shrink
and
flee
from
them
and
moroni
perceiving
their
intent
sent
forth
and
inspired
their
hearts
with
these
thoughtsyea
the
thoughts
of
their
lands
their
liberty
yea
their
freedom
from
bondage

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
turned
upon
the
lamanites
and
they
cried
with
one
voice
unto
the
lord
their
god
for
their
liberty
and
their
freedom
from
bondage

and
they
began
to
stand
against
the
lamanites
with
power
and
in
that
selfsame
hour
that
they
cried
unto
the
lord
for
their
freedom
the
lamanites
began
to
flee
before
them
and
they
fled
even
to
the
waters
of
sidon

now
the
lamanites
were
more
numerous
yea
by
more
than
double
the
number
of
the
nephites
nevertheless
they
were
driven
insomuch
that
they
were
gathered
together
in
one
body
in
the
valley
upon
the
bank
by
the
river
sidon

therefore
the
armies
of
moroni
encircled
them
about
yea
even
on
both
sides
of
the
river
for
behold
on
the
east
were
the
men
of
lehi

therefore
when
zerahemnah
saw
the
men
of
lehi
on
the
east
of
the
river
sidon
and
the
armies
of
moroni
on
the
west
of
the
river
sidon
that
they
were
encircled
about
by
the
nephites
they
were
struck
with
terror

now
moroni
when
he
saw
their
terror
commanded
his
men
that
they
should
stop
shedding
their
blood
alma
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
stop
and
withdrew
a
pace
from
them
and
moroni
said
unto
zerahemnah
behold
zerahemnah
that
we
do
not
desire
to
be
men
of
blood
ye
know
that
ye
are
in
our
hands
yet
we
do
not
desire
to
slay
you

behold
we
have
not
come
out
to
battle
against
you
that
we
might
shed
your
blood
for
power
neither
do
we
desire
to
bring
any
one
to
the
yoke
of
bondage
but
this
is
the
very
cause
for
which
ye
have
come
against
us
yea
and
ye
are
angry
with
us
because
of
our
religion

but
now
ye
behold
that
the
lord
is
with
us
and
ye
behold
that
he
has
delivered
you
into
our
hands
and
now
i
would
that
ye
should
understand
that
this
is
done
unto
us
because
of
our
religion
and
our
faith
in
christ
and
now
ye
see
that
ye
cannot
destroy
this
our
faith

now
ye
see
that
this
is
the
true
faith
of
god
yea
ye
see
that
god
will
support
and
keep
and
preserve
us
so
long
as
we
are
faithful
unto
him
and
unto
our
faith
and
our
religion
and
never
will
the
lord
suffer
that
we
shall
be
destroyed
except
we
should
fall
into
transgression
and
deny
our
faith

and
now
zerahemnah
i
command
you
in
the
name
of
that
allpowerful
god
who
has
strengthened
our
arms
that
we
have
gained
power
over
you
by
our
faith
by
our
religion
and
by
our
rites
of
worship
and
by
our
church
and
by
the
sacred
support
which
we
owe
to
our
wives
and
our
children
by
that
liberty
which
binds
us
to
our
lands
and
our
country
yea
and
also
by
the
maintenance
of
the
sacred
word
of
god
to
which
we
owe
all
our
happiness
and
by
all
that
is
most
dear
unto
us

yea
and
this
is
not
all
i
command
you
by
all
the
desires
which
ye
have
for
life
that
ye
deliver
up
your
weapons
of
war
unto
us
and
we
will
seek
not
your
blood
but
we
will
spare
your
lives
if
ye
will
go
your
way
and
come
not
again
to
war
against
us

and
now
if
ye
do
not
this
behold
ye
are
in
our
hands
and
i
will
command
my
men
that
they
shall
fall
upon
you
and
inflict
the
wounds
of
death
in
your
bodies
that
ye
may
become
extinct
and
then
we
will
see
who
shall
have
power
over
this
people
yea
we
will
see
who
shall
be
brought
into
bondage

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
zerahemnah
had
heard
these
sayings
he
came
forth
and
delivered
up
his
sword
and
his
cimeter
and
his
bow
into
the
hands
of
moroni
and
said
unto
him
behold
here
are
our
weapons
of
war
we
will
deliver
them
up
unto
you
but
we
will
not
suffer
ourselves
to
take
an
oath
unto
you
which
we
know
that
we
shall
break
and
also
our
children
but
take
our
weapons
of
war
and
suffer
that
we
may
depart
into
the
wilderness
otherwise
we
will
retain
our
swords
and
we
will
perish
or
conquer

behold
we
are
not
of
your
faith
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is
god
that
has
delivered
us
into
your
hands
but
we
believe
that
it
is
your
cunning
that
has
preserved
you
from
our
swords
behold
it
is
your
breastplates
and
your
shields
that
have
preserved
you

and
now
when
zerahemnah
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
these
words
moroni
returned
the
sword
and
the
weapons
of
war
which
he
had
received
unto
zerahemnah
saying
behold
we
will
end
the
conflict

now
i
cannot
recall
the
words
which
i
have
spoken
therefore
as
the
lord
liveth
ye
shall
not
depart
except
ye
depart
with
an
oath
that
ye
will
not
return
again
against
us
to
war
now
as
ye
are
in
our
hands
we
will
spill
your
blood
upon
the
ground
or
ye
shall
submit
to
the
conditions
which
i
have
proposed

and
now
when
moroni
had
said
these
words
zerahemnah
retained
his
sword
and
he
was
angry
with
moroni
and
he
rushed
forward
that
he
might
slay
moroni
but
as
he
raised
his
sword
behold
one
of
moronis
soldiers
smote
it
even
to
the
earth
and
it
broke
by
the
hilt
and
he
also
smote
zerahemnah
that
he
took
off
his
scalp
and
it
fell
to
the
earth
and
zerahemnah
withdrew
from
before
them
into
the
midst
of
his
soldiers

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
soldier
who
stood
by
who
smote
off
the
scalp
of
zerahemnah
took
up
the
scalp
from
off
the
ground
by
the
hair
and
laid
it
upon
the
point
of
his
sword
and
stretched
it
forth
unto
them
saying
unto
them
with
a
loud
voice

even
as
this
scalp
has
fallen
to
the
earth
which
is
the
scalp
of
your
chief
so
shall
ye
fall
to
the
earth
except
ye
will
deliver
up
your
weapons
of
war
and
depart
with
a
covenant
of
peace

now
there
were
many
when
they
heard
these
words
and
saw
the
scalp
which
was
upon
the
sword
that
were
struck
with
fear
and
many
came
forth
and
threw
down
their
weapons
of
war
at
the
feet
of
moroni
and
entered
into
a
covenant
of
peace
and
as
many
as
entered
into
a
covenant
they
suffered
to
depart
into
the
wilderness

now
it
came
to
pass
that
zerahemnah
was
exceedingly
wroth
and
he
did
stir
up
the
remainder
of
his
soldiers
to
anger
to
contend
more
powerfully
against
the
nephites

and
now
moroni
was
angry
because
of
the
stubbornness
of
the
lamanites
therefore
he
commanded
his
people
that
they
should
fall
upon
them
and
slay
them
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
began
to
slay
them
yea
and
the
lamanites
did
contend
with
their
swords
and
their
might

but
behold
their
naked
skins
and
their
bare
heads
were
exposed
to
the
sharp
swords
of
the
nephites
yea
behold
they
were
pierced
and
smitten
yea
and
did
fall
exceedingly
fast
before
the
swords
of
the
nephites
and
they
began
to
be
swept
down
even
as
the
soldier
of
moroni
had
prophesied

now
zerahemnah
when
he
saw
that
they
were
all
about
to
be
destroyed
cried
mightily
unto
moroni
promising
that
he
would
covenant
and
also
his
people
with
them
if
they
would
spare
the
remainder
of
their
lives
that
they
never
would
come
to
war
again
against
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
caused
that
the
work
of
death
should
cease
again
among
the
people
and
he
took
the
weapons
of
war
from
the
lamanites
and
after
they
had
entered
into
a
covenant
with
him
of
peace
they
were
suffered
to
depart
into
the
wilderness

now
the
number
of
their
dead
was
not
numbered
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
number
yea
the
number
of
their
dead
was
exceedingly
great
both
on
the
nephites
and
on
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
cast
their
dead
into
the
waters
of
sidon
and
they
have
gone
forth
and
are
buried
in
the
depths
of
the
sea

and
the
armies
of
the
nephites
or
of
moroni
returned
and
came
to
their
houses
and
their
lands

and
thus
ended
the
eighteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
and
thus
ended
the
record
of
alma
which
was
written
upon
the
plates
of
nephi
alma
chapter


behold
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
nephi
were
exceedingly
rejoiced
because
the
lord
had
again
delivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
therefore
they
gave
thanks
unto
the
lord
their
god
yea
and
they
did
fast
much
and
pray
much
and
they
did
worship
god
with
exceedingly
great
joy

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
nineteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
that
alma
came
unto
his
son
helaman
and
said
unto
him
believest
thou
the
words
which
i
spake
unto
thee
concerning
those
records
which
have
been
kept

and
helaman
said
unto
him
yea
i
believe

and
alma
said
again
believest
thou
in
jesus
christ
who
shall
come

and
he
said
yea
i
believe
all
the
words
which
thou
hast
spoken

and
alma
said
unto
him
again
will
ye
keep
my
commandments

and
he
said
yea
i
will
keep
thy
commandments
with
all
my
heart

then
alma
said
unto
him
blessed
art
thou
and
the
lord
shall
prosper
thee
in
this
land

but
behold
i
have
somewhat
to
prophesy
unto
thee
but
what
i
prophesy
unto
thee
ye
shall
not
make
known
yea
what
i
prophesy
unto
thee
shall
not
be
made
known
even
until
the
prophecy
is
fulfilled
therefore
write
the
words
which
i
shall
say

and
these
are
the
words
behold
i
perceive
that
this
very
people
the
nephites
according
to
the
spirit
of
revelation
which
is
in
me
in
four
hundred
years
from
the
time
that
jesus
christ
shall
manifest
himself
unto
them
shall
dwindle
in
unbelief

yea
and
then
shall
they
see
wars
and
pestilences
yea
famines
and
bloodshed
even
until
the
people
of
nephi
shall
become
extinct

yea
and
this
because
they
shall
dwindle
in
unbelief
and
fall
into
the
works
of
darkness
and
lasciviousness
and
all
manner
of
iniquities
yea
i
say
unto
you
that
because
they
shall
sin
against
so
great
light
and
knowledge
yea
i
say
unto
you
that
from
that
day
even
the
fourth
generation
shall
not
all
pass
away
before
this
great
iniquity
shall
come

and
when
that
great
day
cometh
behold
the
time
very
soon
cometh
that
those
who
are
now
or
the
seed
of
those
who
are
now
numbered
among
the
people
of
nephi
shall
no
more
be
numbered
among
the
people
of
nephi

but
whosoever
remaineth
and
is
not
destroyed
in
that
great
and
dreadful
day
shall
be
numbered
among
the
lamanites
and
shall
become
like
unto
them
all
save
it
be
a
few
who
shall
be
called
the
disciples
of
the
lord
and
them
shall
the
lamanites
pursue
even
until
they
shall
become
extinct
and
now
because
of
iniquity
this
prophecy
shall
be
fulfilled

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
alma
had
said
these
things
to
helaman
he
blessed
him
and
also
his
other
sons
and
he
also
blessed
the
earth
for
the
righteous
sake

and
he
said
thus
saith
the
lord
godcursed
shall
be
the
land
yea
this
land
unto
every
nation
kindred
tongue
and
people
unto
destruction
which
do
wickedly
when
they
are
fully
ripe
and
as
i
have
said
so
shall
it
be
for
this
is
the
cursing
and
the
blessing
of
god
upon
the
land
for
the
lord
cannot
look
upon
sin
with
the
least
degree
of
allowance

and
now
when
alma
had
said
these
words
he
blessed
the
church
yea
all
those
who
should
stand
fast
in
the
faith
from
that
time
henceforth

and
when
alma
had
done
this
he
departed
out
of
the
land
of
zarahemla
as
if
to
go
into
the
land
of
melek
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
was
never
heard
of
more
as
to
his
death
or
burial
we
know
not
of

behold
this
we
know
that
he
was
a
righteous
man
and
the
saying
went
abroad
in
the
church
that
he
was
taken
up
by
the
spirit
or
buried
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
even
as
moses
but
behold
the
scriptures
saith
the
lord
took
moses
unto
himself
and
we
suppose
that
he
has
also
received
alma
in
the
spirit
unto
himself
therefore
for
this
cause
we
know
nothing
concerning
his
death
and
burial

and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
nineteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
that
helaman
went
forth
among
the
people
to
declare
the
word
unto
them

for
behold
because
of
their
wars
with
the
lamanites
and
the
many
little
dissensions
and
disturbances
which
had
been
among
the
people
it
became
expedient
that
the
word
of
god
should
be
declared
among
them
yea
and
that
a
regulation
should
be
made
throughout
the
church

therefore
helaman
and
his
brethren
went
forth
to
establish
the
church
again
in
all
the
land
yea
in
every
city
throughout
all
the
land
which
was
possessed
by
the
people
of
nephi
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
appoint
priests
and
teachers
throughout
all
the
land
over
all
the
churches

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
helaman
and
his
brethren
had
appointed
priests
and
teachers
over
the
churches
that
there
arose
a
dissension
among
them
and
they
would
not
give
heed
to
the
words
of
helaman
and
his
brethren

but
they
grew
proud
being
lifted
up
in
their
hearts
because
of
their
exceedingly
great
riches
therefore
they
grew
rich
in
their
own
eyes
and
would
not
give
heed
to
their
words
to
walk
uprightly
before
god
alma
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
many
as
would
not
hearken
to
the
words
of
helaman
and
his
brethren
were
gathered
together
against
their
brethren

and
now
behold
they
were
exceedingly
wroth
insomuch
that
they
were
determined
to
slay
them

now
the
leader
of
those
who
were
wroth
against
their
brethren
was
a
large
and
a
strong
man
and
his
name
was
amalickiah

and
amalickiah
was
desirous
to
be
a
king
and
those
people
who
were
wroth
were
also
desirous
that
he
should
be
their
king
and
they
were
the
greater
part
of
them
the
lower
judges
of
the
land
and
they
were
seeking
for
power

and
they
had
been
led
by
the
flatteries
of
amalickiah
that
if
they
would
support
him
and
establish
him
to
be
their
king
that
he
would
make
them
rulers
over
the
people

thus
they
were
led
away
by
amalickiah
to
dissensions
notwithstanding
the
preaching
of
helaman
and
his
brethren
yea
notwithstanding
their
exceedingly
great
care
over
the
church
for
they
were
high
priests
over
the
church

and
there
were
many
in
the
church
who
believed
in
the
flattering
words
of
amalickiah
therefore
they
dissented
even
from
the
church
and
thus
were
the
affairs
of
the
people
of
nephi
exceedingly
precarious
and
dangerous
notwithstanding
their
great
victory
which
they
had
had
over
the
lamanites
and
their
great
rejoicings
which
they
had
had
because
of
their
deliverance
by
the
hand
of
the
lord

thus
we
see
how
quick
the
children
of
men
do
forget
the
lord
their
god
yea
how
quick
to
do
iniquity
and
to
be
led
away
by
the
evil
one

yea
and
we
also
see
the
great
wickedness
one
very
wicked
man
can
cause
to
take
place
among
the
children
of
men

yea
we
see
that
amalickiah
because
he
was
a
man
of
cunning
device
and
a
man
of
many
flattering
words
that
he
led
away
the
hearts
of
many
people
to
do
wickedly
yea
and
to
seek
to
destroy
the
church
of
god
and
to
destroy
the
foundation
of
liberty
which
god
had
granted
unto
them
or
which
blessing
god
had
sent
upon
the
face
of
the
land
for
the
righteous
sake

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
moroni
who
was
the
chief
commander
of
the
armies
of
the
nephites
had
heard
of
these
dissensions
he
was
angry
with
amalickiah

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
rent
his
coat
and
he
took
a
piece
thereof
and
wrote
upon
itin
memory
of
our
god
our
religion
and
freedom
and
our
peace
our
wives
and
our
childrenand
he
fastened
it
upon
the
end
of
a
pole

and
he
fastened
on
his
headplate
and
his
breastplate
and
his
shields
and
girded
on
his
armor
about
his
loins
and
he
took
the
pole
which
had
on
the
end
thereof
his
rent
coat
and
he
called
it
the
title
of
liberty
and
he
bowed
himself
to
the
earth
and
he
prayed
mightily
unto
his
god
for
the
blessings
of
liberty
to
rest
upon
his
brethren
so
long
as
there
should
a
band
of
christians
remain
to
possess
the
land

for
thus
were
all
the
true
believers
of
christ
who
belonged
to
the
church
of
god
called
by
those
who
did
not
belong
to
the
church

and
those
who
did
belong
to
the
church
were
faithful
yea
all
those
who
were
true
believers
in
christ
took
upon
them
gladly
the
name
of
christ
or
christians
as
they
were
called
because
of
their
belief
in
christ
who
should
come

and
therefore
at
this
time
moroni
prayed
that
the
cause
of
the
christians
and
the
freedom
of
the
land
might
be
favored

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
poured
out
his
soul
to
god
he
named
all
the
land
which
was
south
of
the
land
desolation
yea
and
in
fine
all
the
land
both
on
the
north
and
on
the
southa
chosen
land
and
the
land
of
liberty

and
he
said
surely
god
shall
not
suffer
that
we
who
are
despised
because
we
take
upon
us
the
name
of
christ
shall
be
trodden
down
and
destroyed
until
we
bring
it
upon
us
by
our
own
transgressions

and
when
moroni
had
said
these
words
he
went
forth
among
the
people
waving
the
rent
part
of
his
garment
in
the
air
that
all
might
see
the
writing
which
he
had
written
upon
the
rent
part
and
crying
with
a
loud
voice
saying

behold
whosoever
will
maintain
this
title
upon
the
land
let
them
come
forth
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
and
enter
into
a
covenant
that
they
will
maintain
their
rights
and
their
religion
that
the
lord
god
may
bless
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
moroni
had
proclaimed
these
words
behold
the
people
came
running
together
with
their
armor
girded
about
their
loins
rending
their
garments
in
token
or
as
a
covenant
that
they
would
not
forsake
the
lord
their
god
or
in
other
words
if
they
should
transgress
the
commandments
of
god
or
fall
into
transgression
and
be
ashamed
to
take
upon
them
the
name
of
christ
the
lord
should
rend
them
even
as
they
had
rent
their
garments

now
this
was
the
covenant
which
they
made
and
they
cast
their
garments
at
the
feet
of
moroni
saying
we
covenant
with
our
god
that
we
shall
be
destroyed
even
as
our
brethren
in
the
land
northward
if
we
shall
fall
into
transgression
yea
he
may
cast
us
at
the
feet
of
our
enemies
even
as
we
have
cast
our
garments
at
thy
feet
to
be
trodden
under
foot
if
we
shall
fall
into
transgression

moroni
said
unto
them
behold
we
are
a
remnant
of
the
seed
of
jacob
yea
we
are
a
remnant
of
the
seed
of
joseph
whose
coat
was
rent
by
his
brethren
into
many
pieces
yea
and
now
behold
let
us
remember
to
keep
the
commandments
of
god
or
our
garments
shall
be
rent
by
our
brethren
and
we
be
cast
into
prison
or
be
sold
or
be
slain

yea
let
us
preserve
our
liberty
as
a
remnant
of
joseph
yea
let
us
remember
the
words
of
jacob
before
his
death
for
behold
he
saw
that
a
part
of
the
remnant
of
the
coat
of
joseph
was
preserved
and
had
not
decayed
and
he
saideven
as
this
remnant
of
garment
of
my
son
hath
been
preserved
so
shall
a
remnant
of
the
seed
of
my
son
be
preserved
by
the
hand
of
god
and
be
taken
unto
himself
while
the
remainder
of
the
seed
of
joseph
shall
perish
even
as
the
remnant
of
his
garment

now
behold
this
giveth
my
soul
sorrow
nevertheless
my
soul
hath
joy
in
my
son
because
of
that
part
of
his
seed
which
shall
be
taken
unto
god

now
behold
this
was
the
language
of
jacob

and
now
who
knoweth
but
what
the
remnant
of
the
seed
of
joseph
which
shall
perish
as
his
garment
are
those
who
have
dissented
from
us
yea
and
even
it
shall
be
ourselves
if
we
do
not
stand
fast
in
the
faith
of
christ

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
moroni
had
said
these
words
he
went
forth
and
also
sent
forth
in
all
the
parts
of
the
land
where
there
were
dissensions
and
gathered
together
all
the
people
who
were
desirous
to
maintain
their
liberty
to
stand
against
amalickiah
and
those
who
had
dissented
who
were
called
amalickiahites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
amalickiah
saw
that
the
people
of
moroni
were
more
numerous
than
the
amalickiahitesand
he
also
saw
that
his
people
were
doubtful
concerning
the
justice
of
the
cause
in
which
they
had
undertakentherefore
fearing
that
he
should
not
gain
the
point
he
took
those
of
his
people
who
would
and
departed
into
the
land
of
nephi

now
moroni
thought
it
was
not
expedient
that
the
lamanites
should
have
any
more
strength
therefore
he
thought
to
cut
off
the
people
of
amalickiah
or
to
take
them
and
bring
them
back
and
put
amalickiah
to
death
yea
for
he
knew
that
he
would
stir
up
the
lamanites
to
anger
against
them
and
cause
them
to
come
to
battle
against
them
and
this
he
knew
that
amalickiah
would
do
that
he
might
obtain
his
purposes

therefore
moroni
thought
it
was
expedient
that
he
should
take
his
armies
who
had
gathered
themselves
together
and
armed
themselves
and
entered
into
a
covenant
to
keep
the
peaceand
it
came
to
pass
that
he
took
his
army
and
marched
out
with
his
tents
into
the
wilderness
to
cut
off
the
course
of
amalickiah
in
the
wilderness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
according
to
his
desires
and
marched
forth
into
the
wilderness
and
headed
the
armies
of
amalickiah

and
it
came
to
pass
that
amalickiah
fled
with
a
small
number
of
his
men
and
the
remainder
were
delivered
up
into
the
hands
of
moroni
and
were
taken
back
into
the
land
of
zarahemla

now
moroni
being
a
man
who
was
appointed
by
the
chief
judges
and
the
voice
of
the
people
therefore
he
had
power
according
to
his
will
with
the
armies
of
the
nephites
to
establish
and
to
exercise
authority
over
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
whomsoever
of
the
amalickiahites
that
would
not
enter
into
a
covenant
to
support
the
cause
of
freedom
that
they
might
maintain
a
free
government
he
caused
to
be
put
to
death
and
there
were
but
few
who
denied
the
covenant
of
freedom

and
it
came
to
pass
also
that
he
caused
the
title
of
liberty
to
be
hoisted
upon
every
tower
which
was
in
all
the
land
which
was
possessed
by
the
nephites
and
thus
moroni
planted
the
standard
of
liberty
among
the
nephites

and
they
began
to
have
peace
again
in
the
land
and
thus
they
did
maintain
peace
in
the
land
until
nearly
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges

and
helaman
and
the
high
priests
did
also
maintain
order
in
the
church
yea
even
for
the
space
of
four
years
did
they
have
much
peace
and
rejoicing
in
the
church

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
who
died
firmly
believing
that
their
souls
were
redeemed
by
the
lord
jesus
christ
thus
they
went
out
of
the
world
rejoicing

and
there
were
some
who
died
with
fevers
which
at
some
seasons
of
the
year
were
very
frequent
in
the
landbut
not
so
much
so
with
fevers
because
of
the
excellent
qualities
of
the
many
plants
and
roots
which
god
had
prepared
to
remove
the
cause
of
diseases
to
which
men
were
subject
by
the
nature
of
the
climate

but
there
were
many
who
died
with
old
age
and
those
who
died
in
the
faith
of
christ
are
happy
in
him
as
we
must
needs
suppose
alma
chapter


now
we
will
return
in
our
record
to
amalickiah
and
those
who
had
fled
with
him
into
the
wilderness
for
behold
he
had
taken
those
who
went
with
him
and
went
up
in
the
land
of
nephi
among
the
lamanites
and
did
stir
up
the
lamanites
to
anger
against
the
people
of
nephi
insomuch
that
the
king
of
the
lamanites
sent
a
proclamation
throughout
all
his
land
among
all
his
people
that
they
should
gather
themselves
together
again
to
go
to
battle
against
the
nephites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
proclamation
had
gone
forth
among
them
they
were
exceedingly
afraid
yea
they
feared
to
displease
the
king
and
they
also
feared
to
go
to
battle
against
the
nephites
lest
they
should
lose
their
lives
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
would
not
or
the
more
part
of
them
would
not
obey
the
commandments
of
the
king

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
was
wroth
because
of
their
disobedience
therefore
he
gave
amalickiah
the
command
of
that
part
of
his
army
which
was
obedient
unto
his
commands
and
commanded
him
that
he
should
go
forth
and
compel
them
to
arms

now
behold
this
was
the
desire
of
amalickiah
for
he
being
a
very
subtle
man
to
do
evil
therefore
he
laid
the
plan
in
his
heart
to
dethrone
the
king
of
the
lamanites

and
now
he
had
got
the
command
of
those
parts
of
the
lamanites
who
were
in
favor
of
the
king
and
he
sought
to
gain
favor
of
those
who
were
not
obedient
therefore
he
went
forward
to
the
place
which
was
called
onidah
for
thither
had
all
the
lamanites
fled
for
they
discovered
the
army
coming
and
supposing
that
they
were
coming
to
destroy
them
therefore
they
fled
to
onidah
to
the
place
of
arms

and
they
had
appointed
a
man
to
be
a
king
and
a
leader
over
them
being
fixed
in
their
minds
with
a
determined
resolution
that
they
would
not
be
subjected
to
go
against
the
nephites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
had
gathered
themselves
together
upon
the
top
of
the
mount
which
was
called
antipas
in
preparation
to
battle

now
it
was
not
amalickiahs
intention
to
give
them
battle
according
to
the
commandments
of
the
king
but
behold
it
was
his
intention
to
gain
favor
with
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
that
he
might
place
himself
at
their
head
and
dethrone
the
king
and
take
possession
of
the
kingdom

and
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
he
caused
his
army
to
pitch
their
tents
in
the
valley
which
was
near
the
mount
antipas

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
it
was
night
he
sent
a
secret
embassy
into
the
mount
antipas
desiring
that
the
leader
of
those
who
were
upon
the
mount
whose
name
was
lehonti
that
he
should
come
down
to
the
foot
of
the
mount
for
he
desired
to
speak
with
him

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
lehonti
received
the
message
he
durst
not
go
down
to
the
foot
of
the
mount
and
it
came
to
pass
that
amalickiah
sent
again
the
second
time
desiring
him
to
come
down
and
it
came
to
pass
that
lehonti
would
not
and
he
sent
again
the
third
time

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
amalickiah
found
that
he
could
not
get
lehonti
to
come
down
off
from
the
mount
he
went
up
into
the
mount
nearly
to
lehontis
camp
and
he
sent
again
the
fourth
time
his
message
unto
lehonti
desiring
that
he
would
come
down
and
that
he
would
bring
his
guards
with
him

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
lehonti
had
come
down
with
his
guards
to
amalickiah
that
amalickiah
desired
him
to
come
down
with
his
army
in
the
nighttime
and
surround
those
men
in
their
camps
over
whom
the
king
had
given
him
command
and
that
he
would
deliver
them
up
into
lehontis
hands
if
he
would
make
him
amalickiah
a
second
leader
over
the
whole
army

and
it
came
to
pass
that
lehonti
came
down
with
his
men
and
surrounded
the
men
of
amalickiah
so
that
before
they
awoke
at
the
dawn
of
day
they
were
surrounded
by
the
armies
of
lehonti

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
saw
that
they
were
surrounded
they
plead
with
amalickiah
that
he
would
suffer
them
to
fall
in
with
their
brethren
that
they
might
not
be
destroyed
now
this
was
the
very
thing
which
amalickiah
desired

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
delivered
his
men
contrary
to
the
commands
of
the
king
now
this
was
the
thing
that
amalickiah
desired
that
he
might
accomplish
his
designs
in
dethroning
the
king

now
it
was
the
custom
among
the
lamanites
if
their
chief
leader
was
killed
to
appoint
the
second
leader
to
be
their
chief
leader

and
it
came
to
pass
that
amalickiah
caused
that
one
of
his
servants
should
administer
poison
by
degrees
to
lehonti
that
he
died

now
when
lehonti
was
dead
the
lamanites
appointed
amalickiah
to
be
their
leader
and
their
chief
commander

and
it
came
to
pass
that
amalickiah
marched
with
his
armies
for
he
had
gained
his
desires
to
the
land
of
nephi
to
the
city
of
nephi
which
was
the
chief
city

and
the
king
came
out
to
meet
him
with
his
guards
for
he
supposed
that
amalickiah
had
fulfilled
his
commands
and
that
amalickiah
had
gathered
together
so
great
an
army
to
go
against
the
nephites
to
battle

but
behold
as
the
king
came
out
to
meet
him
amalickiah
caused
that
his
servants
should
go
forth
to
meet
the
king
and
they
went
and
bowed
themselves
before
the
king
as
if
to
reverence
him
because
of
his
greatness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
put
forth
his
hand
to
raise
them
as
was
the
custom
with
the
lamanites
as
a
token
of
peace
which
custom
they
had
taken
from
the
nephites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
raised
the
first
from
the
ground
behold
he
stabbed
the
king
to
the
heart
and
he
fell
to
the
earth

now
the
servants
of
the
king
fled
and
the
servants
of
amalickiah
raised
a
cry
saying

behold
the
servants
of
the
king
have
stabbed
him
to
the
heart
and
he
has
fallen
and
they
have
fled
behold
come
and
see

and
it
came
to
pass
that
amalickiah
commanded
that
his
armies
should
march
forth
and
see
what
had
happened
to
the
king
and
when
they
had
come
to
the
spot
and
found
the
king
lying
in
his
gore
amalickiah
pretended
to
be
wroth
and
said
whosoever
loved
the
king
let
him
go
forth
and
pursue
his
servants
that
they
may
be
slain

and
it
came
to
pass
that
all
they
who
loved
the
king
when
they
heard
these
words
came
forth
and
pursued
after
the
servants
of
the
king

now
when
the
servants
of
the
king
saw
an
army
pursuing
after
them
they
were
frightened
again
and
fled
into
the
wilderness
and
came
over
into
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
joined
the
people
of
ammon

and
the
army
which
pursued
after
them
returned
having
pursued
after
them
in
vain
and
thus
amalickiah
by
his
fraud
gained
the
hearts
of
the
people

and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
he
entered
the
city
nephi
with
his
armies
and
took
possession
of
the
city

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
queen
when
she
had
heard
that
the
king
was
slainfor
amalickiah
had
sent
an
embassy
to
the
queen
informing
her
that
the
king
had
been
slain
by
his
servants
that
he
had
pursued
them
with
his
army
but
it
was
in
vain
and
they
had
made
their
escape

therefore
when
the
queen
had
received
this
message
she
sent
unto
amalickiah
desiring
him
that
he
would
spare
the
people
of
the
city
and
she
also
desired
him
that
he
should
come
in
unto
her
and
she
also
desired
him
that
he
should
bring
witnesses
with
him
to
testify
concerning
the
death
of
the
king

and
it
came
to
pass
that
amalickiah
took
the
same
servant
that
slew
the
king
and
all
them
who
were
with
him
and
went
in
unto
the
queen
unto
the
place
where
she
sat
and
they
all
testified
unto
her
that
the
king
was
slain
by
his
own
servants
and
they
said
also
they
have
fled
does
not
this
testify
against
them
and
thus
they
satisfied
the
queen
concerning
the
death
of
the
king

and
it
came
to
pass
that
amalickiah
sought
the
favor
of
the
queen
and
took
her
unto
him
to
wife
and
thus
by
his
fraud
and
by
the
assistance
of
his
cunning
servants
he
obtained
the
kingdom
yea
he
was
acknowledged
king
throughout
all
the
land
among
all
the
people
of
the
lamanites
who
were
composed
of
the
lamanites
and
the
lemuelites
and
the
ishmaelites
and
all
the
dissenters
of
the
nephites
from
the
reign
of
nephi
down
to
the
present
time

now
these
dissenters
having
the
same
instruction
and
the
same
information
of
the
nephites
yea
having
been
instructed
in
the
same
knowledge
of
the
lord
nevertheless
it
is
strange
to
relate
not
long
after
their
dissensions
they
became
more
hardened
and
impenitent
and
more
wild
wicked
and
ferocious
than
the
lamanitesdrinking
in
with
the
traditions
of
the
lamanites
giving
way
to
indolence
and
all
manner
of
lasciviousness
yea
entirely
forgetting
the
lord
their
god
alma
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
as
soon
as
amalickiah
had
obtained
the
kingdom
he
began
to
inspire
the
hearts
of
the
lamanites
against
the
people
of
nephi
yea
he
did
appoint
men
to
speak
unto
the
lamanites
from
their
towers
against
the
nephites

and
thus
he
did
inspire
their
hearts
against
the
nephites
insomuch
that
in
the
latter
end
of
the
nineteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
he
having
accomplished
his
designs
thus
far
yea
having
been
made
king
over
the
lamanites
he
sought
also
to
reign
over
all
the
land
yea
and
all
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
the
nephites
as
well
as
the
lamanites

therefore
he
had
accomplished
his
design
for
he
had
hardened
the
hearts
of
the
lamanites
and
blinded
their
minds
and
stirred
them
up
to
anger
insomuch
that
he
had
gathered
together
a
numerous
host
to
go
to
battle
against
the
nephites

for
he
was
determined
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
number
of
his
people
to
overpower
the
nephites
and
to
bring
them
into
bondage

and
thus
he
did
appoint
chief
captains
of
the
zoramites
they
being
the
most
acquainted
with
the
strength
of
the
nephites
and
their
places
of
resort
and
the
weakest
parts
of
their
cities
therefore
he
appointed
them
to
be
chief
captains
over
his
armies

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
took
their
camp
and
moved
forth
toward
the
land
of
zarahemla
in
the
wilderness

now
it
came
to
pass
that
while
amalickiah
had
thus
been
obtaining
power
by
fraud
and
deceit
moroni
on
the
other
hand
had
been
preparing
the
minds
of
the
people
to
be
faithful
unto
the
lord
their
god

yea
he
had
been
strengthening
the
armies
of
the
nephites
and
erecting
small
forts
or
places
of
resort
throwing
up
banks
of
earth
round
about
to
enclose
his
armies
and
also
building
walls
of
stone
to
encircle
them
about
round
about
their
cities
and
the
borders
of
their
lands
yea
all
round
about
the
land

and
in
their
weakest
fortifications
he
did
place
the
greater
number
of
men
and
thus
he
did
fortify
and
strengthen
the
land
which
was
possessed
by
the
nephites

and
thus
he
was
preparing
to
support
their
liberty
their
lands
their
wives
and
their
children
and
their
peace
and
that
they
might
live
unto
the
lord
their
god
and
that
they
might
maintain
that
which
was
called
by
their
enemies
the
cause
of
christians

and
moroni
was
a
strong
and
a
mighty
man
he
was
a
man
of
a
perfect
understanding
yea
a
man
that
did
not
delight
in
bloodshed
a
man
whose
soul
did
joy
in
the
liberty
and
the
freedom
of
his
country
and
his
brethren
from
bondage
and
slavery

yea
a
man
whose
heart
did
swell
with
thanksgiving
to
his
god
for
the
many
privileges
and
blessings
which
he
bestowed
upon
his
people
a
man
who
did
labor
exceedingly
for
the
welfare
and
safety
of
his
people

yea
and
he
was
a
man
who
was
firm
in
the
faith
of
christ
and
he
had
sworn
with
an
oath
to
defend
his
people
his
rights
and
his
country
and
his
religion
even
to
the
loss
of
his
blood

now
the
nephites
were
taught
to
defend
themselves
against
their
enemies
even
to
the
shedding
of
blood
if
it
were
necessary
yea
and
they
were
also
taught
never
to
give
an
offense
yea
and
never
to
raise
the
sword
except
it
were
against
an
enemy
except
it
were
to
preserve
their
lives

and
this
was
their
faith
that
by
so
doing
god
would
prosper
them
in
the
land
or
in
other
words
if
they
were
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
god
that
he
would
prosper
them
in
the
land
yea
warn
them
to
flee
or
to
prepare
for
war
according
to
their
danger

and
also
that
god
would
make
it
known
unto
them
whither
they
should
go
to
defend
themselves
against
their
enemies
and
by
so
doing
the
lord
would
deliver
them
and
this
was
the
faith
of
moroni
and
his
heart
did
glory
in
it
not
in
the
shedding
of
blood
but
in
doing
good
in
preserving
his
people
yea
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
god
yea
and
resisting
iniquity

yea
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
if
all
men
had
been
and
were
and
ever
would
be
like
unto
moroni
behold
the
very
powers
of
hell
would
have
been
shaken
forever
yea
the
devil
would
never
have
power
over
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men

behold
he
was
a
man
like
unto
ammon
the
son
of
mosiah
yea
and
even
the
other
sons
of
mosiah
yea
and
also
alma
and
his
sons
for
they
were
all
men
of
god

now
behold
helaman
and
his
brethren
were
no
less
serviceable
unto
the
people
than
was
moroni
for
they
did
preach
the
word
of
god
and
they
did
baptize
unto
repentance
all
men
whosoever
would
hearken
unto
their
words

and
thus
they
went
forth
and
the
people
did
humble
themselves
because
of
their
words
insomuch
that
they
were
highly
favored
of
the
lord
and
thus
they
were
free
from
wars
and
contentions
among
themselves
yea
even
for
the
space
of
four
years

but
as
i
have
said
in
the
latter
end
of
the
nineteenth
year
yea
notwithstanding
their
peace
amongst
themselves
they
were
compelled
reluctantly
to
contend
with
their
brethren
the
lamanites

yea
and
in
fine
their
wars
never
did
cease
for
the
space
of
many
years
with
the
lamanites
notwithstanding
their
much
reluctance

now
they
were
sorry
to
take
up
arms
against
the
lamanites
because
they
did
not
delight
in
the
shedding
of
blood
yea
and
this
was
not
allthey
were
sorry
to
be
the
means
of
sending
so
many
of
their
brethren
out
of
this
world
into
an
eternal
world
unprepared
to
meet
their
god

nevertheless
they
could
not
suffer
to
lay
down
their
lives
that
their
wives
and
their
children
should
be
massacred
by
the
barbarous
cruelty
of
those
who
were
once
their
brethren
yea
and
had
dissented
from
their
church
and
had
left
them
and
had
gone
to
destroy
them
by
joining
the
lamanites

yea
they
could
not
bear
that
their
brethren
should
rejoice
over
the
blood
of
the
nephites
so
long
as
there
were
any
who
should
keep
the
commandments
of
god
for
the
promise
of
the
lord
was
if
they
should
keep
his
commandments
they
should
prosper
in
the
land
alma
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eleventh
month
of
the
nineteenth
year
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
month
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
were
seen
approaching
towards
the
land
of
ammonihah

and
behold
the
city
had
been
rebuilt
and
moroni
had
stationed
an
army
by
the
borders
of
the
city
and
they
had
cast
up
dirt
around
about
to
shield
them
from
the
arrows
and
the
stones
of
the
lamanites
for
behold
they
fought
with
stones
and
with
arrows

behold
i
said
that
the
city
of
ammonihah
had
been
rebuilt
i
say
unto
you
yea
that
it
was
in
part
rebuilt
and
because
the
lamanites
had
destroyed
it
once
because
of
the
iniquity
of
the
people
they
supposed
that
it
would
again
become
an
easy
prey
for
them

but
behold
how
great
was
their
disappointment
for
behold
the
nephites
had
dug
up
a
ridge
of
earth
round
about
them
which
was
so
high
that
the
lamanites
could
not
cast
their
stones
and
their
arrows
at
them
that
they
might
take
effect
neither
could
they
come
upon
them
save
it
was
by
their
place
of
entrance

now
at
this
time
the
chief
captains
of
the
lamanites
were
astonished
exceedingly
because
of
the
wisdom
of
the
nephites
in
preparing
their
places
of
security

now
the
leaders
of
the
lamanites
had
supposed
because
of
the
greatness
of
their
numbers
yea
they
supposed
that
they
should
be
privileged
to
come
upon
them
as
they
had
hitherto
done
yea
and
they
had
also
prepared
themselves
with
shields
and
with
breastplates
and
they
had
also
prepared
themselves
with
garments
of
skins
yea
very
thick
garments
to
cover
their
nakedness

and
being
thus
prepared
they
supposed
that
they
should
easily
overpower
and
subject
their
brethren
to
the
yoke
of
bondage
or
slay
and
massacre
them
according
to
their
pleasure

but
behold
to
their
uttermost
astonishment
they
were
prepared
for
them
in
a
manner
which
never
had
been
known
among
the
children
of
lehi
now
they
were
prepared
for
the
lamanites
to
battle
after
the
manner
of
the
instructions
of
moroni

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
or
the
amalickiahites
were
exceedingly
astonished
at
their
manner
of
preparation
for
war

now
if
king
amalickiah
had
come
down
out
of
the
land
of
nephi
at
the
head
of
his
army
perhaps
he
would
have
caused
the
lamanites
to
have
attacked
the
nephites
at
the
city
of
ammonihah
for
behold
he
did
care
not
for
the
blood
of
his
people

but
behold
amalickiah
did
not
come
down
himself
to
battle
and
behold
his
chief
captains
durst
not
attack
the
nephites
at
the
city
of
ammonihah
for
moroni
had
altered
the
management
of
affairs
among
the
nephites
insomuch
that
the
lamanites
were
disappointed
in
their
places
of
retreat
and
they
could
not
come
upon
them

therefore
they
retreated
into
the
wilderness
and
took
their
camp
and
marched
towards
the
land
of
noah
supposing
that
to
be
the
next
best
place
for
them
to
come
against
the
nephites

for
they
knew
not
that
moroni
had
fortified
or
had
built
forts
of
security
for
every
city
in
all
the
land
round
about
therefore
they
marched
forward
to
the
land
of
noah
with
a
firm
determination
yea
their
chief
captains
came
forward
and
took
an
oath
that
they
would
destroy
the
people
of
that
city

but
behold
to
their
astonishment
the
city
of
noah
which
had
hitherto
been
a
weak
place
had
now
by
the
means
of
moroni
become
strong
yea
even
to
exceed
the
strength
of
the
city
ammonihah

and
now
behold
this
was
wisdom
in
moroni
for
he
had
supposed
that
they
would
be
frightened
at
the
city
ammonihah
and
as
the
city
of
noah
had
hitherto
been
the
weakest
part
of
the
land
therefore
they
would
march
thither
to
battle
and
thus
it
was
according
to
his
desires

and
behold
moroni
had
appointed
lehi
to
be
chief
captain
over
the
men
of
that
city
and
it
was
that
same
lehi
who
fought
with
the
lamanites
in
the
valley
on
the
east
of
the
river
sidon

and
now
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lamanites
had
found
that
lehi
commanded
the
city
they
were
again
disappointed
for
they
feared
lehi
exceedingly
nevertheless
their
chief
captains
had
sworn
with
an
oath
to
attack
the
city
therefore
they
brought
up
their
armies

now
behold
the
lamanites
could
not
get
into
their
forts
of
security
by
any
other
way
save
by
the
entrance
because
of
the
highness
of
the
bank
which
had
been
thrown
up
and
the
depth
of
the
ditch
which
had
been
dug
round
about
save
it
were
by
the
entrance

and
thus
were
the
nephites
prepared
to
destroy
all
such
as
should
attempt
to
climb
up
to
enter
the
fort
by
any
other
way
by
casting
over
stones
and
arrows
at
them

thus
they
were
prepared
yea
a
body
of
their
strongest
men
with
their
swords
and
their
slings
to
smite
down
all
who
should
attempt
to
come
into
their
place
of
security
by
the
place
of
entrance
and
thus
were
they
prepared
to
defend
themselves
against
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
captains
of
the
lamanites
brought
up
their
armies
before
the
place
of
entrance
and
began
to
contend
with
the
nephites
to
get
into
their
place
of
security
but
behold
they
were
driven
back
from
time
to
time
insomuch
that
they
were
slain
with
an
immense
slaughter

now
when
they
found
that
they
could
not
obtain
power
over
the
nephites
by
the
pass
they
began
to
dig
down
their
banks
of
earth
that
they
might
obtain
a
pass
to
their
armies
that
they
might
have
an
equal
chance
to
fight
but
behold
in
these
attempts
they
were
swept
off
by
the
stones
and
arrows
which
were
thrown
at
them
and
instead
of
filling
up
their
ditches
by
pulling
down
the
banks
of
earth
they
were
filled
up
in
a
measure
with
their
dead
and
wounded
bodies

thus
the
nephites
had
all
power
over
their
enemies
and
thus
the
lamanites
did
attempt
to
destroy
the
nephites
until
their
chief
captains
were
all
slain
yea
and
more
than
a
thousand
of
the
lamanites
were
slain
while
on
the
other
hand
there
was
not
a
single
soul
of
the
nephites
which
was
slain

there
were
about
fifty
who
were
wounded
who
had
been
exposed
to
the
arrows
of
the
lamanites
through
the
pass
but
they
were
shielded
by
their
shields
and
their
breastplates
and
their
headplates
insomuch
that
their
wounds
were
upon
their
legs
many
of
which
were
very
severe

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lamanites
saw
that
their
chief
captains
were
all
slain
they
fled
into
the
wilderness
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
returned
to
the
land
of
nephi
to
inform
their
king
amalickiah
who
was
a
nephite
by
birth
concerning
their
great
loss

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
was
exceedingly
angry
with
his
people
because
he
had
not
obtained
his
desire
over
the
nephites
he
had
not
subjected
them
to
the
yoke
of
bondage

yea
he
was
exceedingly
wroth
and
he
did
curse
god
and
also
moroni
swearing
with
an
oath
that
he
would
drink
his
blood
and
this
because
moroni
had
kept
the
commandments
of
god
in
preparing
for
the
safety
of
his
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
other
hand
the
people
of
nephi
did
thank
the
lord
their
god
because
of
his
matchless
power
in
delivering
them
from
the
hands
of
their
enemies

and
thus
ended
the
nineteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi

yea
and
there
was
continual
peace
among
them
and
exceedingly
great
prosperity
in
the
church
because
of
their
heed
and
diligence
which
they
gave
unto
the
word
of
god
which
was
declared
unto
them
by
helaman
and
shiblon
and
corianton
and
ammon
and
his
brethren
yea
and
by
all
those
who
had
been
ordained
by
the
holy
order
of
god
being
baptized
unto
repentance
and
sent
forth
to
preach
among
the
people
alma
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
did
not
stop
making
preparations
for
war
or
to
defend
his
people
against
the
lamanites
for
he
caused
that
his
armies
should
commence
in
the
commencement
of
the
twentieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
that
they
should
commence
in
digging
up
heaps
of
earth
round
about
all
the
cities
throughout
all
the
land
which
was
possessed
by
the
nephites

and
upon
the
top
of
these
ridges
of
earth
he
caused
that
there
should
be
timbers
yea
works
of
timbers
built
up
to
the
height
of
a
man
round
about
the
cities

and
he
caused
that
upon
those
works
of
timbers
there
should
be
a
frame
of
pickets
built
upon
the
timbers
round
about
and
they
were
strong
and
high

and
he
caused
towers
to
be
erected
that
overlooked
those
works
of
pickets
and
he
caused
places
of
security
to
be
built
upon
those
towers
that
the
stones
and
the
arrows
of
the
lamanites
could
not
hurt
them

and
they
were
prepared
that
they
could
cast
stones
from
the
top
thereof
according
to
their
pleasure
and
their
strength
and
slay
him
who
should
attempt
to
approach
near
the
walls
of
the
city

thus
moroni
did
prepare
strongholds
against
the
coming
of
their
enemies
round
about
every
city
in
all
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
caused
that
his
armies
should
go
forth
into
the
east
wilderness
yea
and
they
went
forth
and
drove
all
the
lamanites
who
were
in
the
east
wilderness
into
their
own
lands
which
were
south
of
the
land
of
zarahemla

and
the
land
of
nephi
did
run
in
a
straight
course
from
the
east
sea
to
the
west

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
moroni
had
driven
all
the
lamanites
out
of
the
east
wilderness
which
was
north
of
the
lands
of
their
own
possessions
he
caused
that
the
inhabitants
who
were
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
in
the
land
round
about
should
go
forth
into
the
east
wilderness
even
to
the
borders
by
the
seashore
and
possess
the
land

and
he
also
placed
armies
on
the
south
in
the
borders
of
their
possessions
and
caused
them
to
erect
fortifications
that
they
might
secure
their
armies
and
their
people
from
the
hands
of
their
enemies

and
thus
he
cut
off
all
the
strongholds
of
the
lamanites
in
the
east
wilderness
yea
and
also
on
the
west
fortifying
the
line
between
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites
between
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
the
land
of
nephi
from
the
west
sea
running
by
the
head
of
the
river
sidonthe
nephites
possessing
all
the
land
northward
yea
even
all
the
land
which
was
northward
of
the
land
bountiful
according
to
their
pleasure

thus
moroni
with
his
armies
which
did
increase
daily
because
of
the
assurance
of
protection
which
his
works
did
bring
forth
unto
them
did
seek
to
cut
off
the
strength
and
the
power
of
the
lamanites
from
off
the
lands
of
their
possessions
that
they
should
have
no
power
upon
the
lands
of
their
possession

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
nephites
began
the
foundation
of
a
city
and
they
called
the
name
of
the
city
moroni
and
it
was
by
the
east
sea
and
it
was
on
the
south
by
the
line
of
the
possessions
of
the
lamanites

and
they
also
began
a
foundation
for
a
city
between
the
city
of
moroni
and
the
city
of
aaron
joining
the
borders
of
aaron
and
moroni
and
they
called
the
name
of
the
city
or
the
land
nephihah

and
they
also
began
in
that
same
year
to
build
many
cities
on
the
north
one
in
a
particular
manner
which
they
called
lehi
which
was
in
the
north
by
the
borders
of
the
seashore

and
thus
ended
the
twentieth
year

and
in
these
prosperous
circumstances
were
the
people
of
nephi
in
the
commencement
of
the
twenty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi

and
they
did
prosper
exceedingly
and
they
became
exceedingly
rich
yea
and
they
did
multiply
and
wax
strong
in
the
land

and
thus
we
see
how
merciful
and
just
are
all
the
dealings
of
the
lord
to
the
fulfilling
of
all
his
words
unto
the
children
of
men
yea
we
can
behold
that
his
words
are
verified
even
at
this
time
which
he
spake
unto
lehi
saying

blessed
art
thou
and
thy
children
and
they
shall
be
blessed
inasmuch
as
they
shall
keep
my
commandments
they
shall
prosper
in
the
land
but
remember
inasmuch
as
they
will
not
keep
my
commandments
they
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord

and
we
see
that
these
promises
have
been
verified
to
the
people
of
nephi
for
it
has
been
their
quarrelings
and
their
contentions
yea
their
murderings
and
their
plunderings
their
idolatry
their
whoredoms
and
their
abominations
which
were
among
themselves
which
brought
upon
them
their
wars
and
their
destructions

and
those
who
were
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
the
lord
were
delivered
at
all
times
whilst
thousands
of
their
wicked
brethren
have
been
consigned
to
bondage
or
to
perish
by
the
sword
or
to
dwindle
in
unbelief
and
mingle
with
the
lamanites

but
behold
there
never
was
a
happier
time
among
the
people
of
nephi
since
the
days
of
nephi
than
in
the
days
of
moroni
yea
even
at
this
time
in
the
twenty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
twenty
and
second
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
also
ended
in
peace
yea
and
also
the
twenty
and
third
year

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
commencement
of
the
twenty
and
fourth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
there
would
also
have
been
peace
among
the
people
of
nephi
had
it
not
been
for
a
contention
which
took
place
among
them
concerning
the
land
of
lehi
and
the
land
of
morianton
which
joined
upon
the
borders
of
lehi
both
of
which
were
on
the
borders
by
the
seashore

for
behold
the
people
who
possessed
the
land
of
morianton
did
claim
a
part
of
the
land
of
lehi
therefore
there
began
to
be
a
warm
contention
between
them
insomuch
that
the
people
of
morianton
took
up
arms
against
their
brethren
and
they
were
determined
by
the
sword
to
slay
them

but
behold
the
people
who
possessed
the
land
of
lehi
fled
to
the
camp
of
moroni
and
appealed
unto
him
for
assistance
for
behold
they
were
not
in
the
wrong

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
people
of
morianton
who
were
led
by
a
man
whose
name
was
morianton
found
that
the
people
of
lehi
had
fled
to
the
camp
of
moroni
they
were
exceedingly
fearful
lest
the
army
of
moroni
should
come
upon
them
and
destroy
them

therefore
morianton
put
it
into
their
hearts
that
they
should
flee
to
the
land
which
was
northward
which
was
covered
with
large
bodies
of
water
and
take
possession
of
the
land
which
was
northward

and
behold
they
would
have
carried
this
plan
into
effect
which
would
have
been
a
cause
to
have
been
lamented
but
behold
morianton
being
a
man
of
much
passion
therefore
he
was
angry
with
one
of
his
maid
servants
and
he
fell
upon
her
and
beat
her
much

and
it
came
to
pass
that
she
fled
and
came
over
to
the
camp
of
moroni
and
told
moroni
all
things
concerning
the
matter
and
also
concerning
their
intentions
to
flee
into
the
land
northward

now
behold
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
bountiful
or
rather
moroni
feared
that
they
would
hearken
to
the
words
of
morianton
and
unite
with
his
people
and
thus
he
would
obtain
possession
of
those
parts
of
the
land
which
would
lay
a
foundation
for
serious
consequences
among
the
people
of
nephi
yea
which
consequences
would
lead
to
the
overthrow
of
their
liberty

therefore
moroni
sent
an
army
with
their
camp
to
head
the
people
of
morianton
to
stop
their
flight
into
the
land
northward

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
not
head
them
until
they
had
come
to
the
borders
of
the
land
desolation
and
there
they
did
head
them
by
the
narrow
pass
which
led
by
the
sea
into
the
land
northward
yea
by
the
sea
on
the
west
and
on
the
east

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
army
which
was
sent
by
moroni
which
was
led
by
a
man
whose
name
was
teancum
did
meet
the
people
of
morianton
and
so
stubborn
were
the
people
of
morianton
being
inspired
by
his
wickedness
and
his
flattering
words
that
a
battle
commenced
between
them
in
the
which
teancum
did
slay
morianton
and
defeat
his
army
and
took
them
prisoners
and
returned
to
the
camp
of
moroni
and
thus
ended
the
twenty
and
fourth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi

and
thus
were
the
people
of
morianton
brought
back
and
upon
their
covenanting
to
keep
the
peace
they
were
restored
to
the
land
of
morianton
and
a
union
took
place
between
them
and
the
people
of
lehi
and
they
were
also
restored
to
their
lands

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
same
year
that
the
people
of
nephi
had
peace
restored
unto
them
that
nephihah
the
second
chief
judge
died
having
filled
the
judgmentseat
with
perfect
uprightness
before
god

nevertheless
he
had
refused
alma
to
take
possession
of
those
records
and
those
things
which
were
esteemed
by
alma
and
his
fathers
to
be
most
sacred
therefore
alma
had
conferred
them
upon
his
son
helaman

behold
it
came
to
pass
that
the
son
of
nephihah
was
appointed
to
fill
the
judgmentseat
in
the
stead
of
his
father
yea
he
was
appointed
chief
judge
and
governor
over
the
people
with
an
oath
and
sacred
ordinance
to
judge
righteously
and
to
keep
the
peace
and
the
freedom
of
the
people
and
to
grant
unto
them
their
sacred
privileges
to
worship
the
lord
their
god
yea
to
support
and
maintain
the
cause
of
god
all
his
days
and
to
bring
the
wicked
to
justice
according
to
their
crime

now
behold
his
name
was
pahoran
and
pahoran
did
fill
the
seat
of
his
father
and
did
commence
his
reign
in
the
end
of
the
twenty
and
fourth
year
over
the
people
of
nephi
alma
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
twenty
and
fifth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
they
having
established
peace
between
the
people
of
lehi
and
the
people
of
morianton
concerning
their
lands
and
having
commenced
the
twenty
and
fifth
year
in
peace

nevertheless
they
did
not
long
maintain
an
entire
peace
in
the
land
for
there
began
to
be
a
contention
among
the
people
concerning
the
chief
judge
pahoran
for
behold
there
were
a
part
of
the
people
who
desired
that
a
few
particular
points
of
the
law
should
be
altered

but
behold
pahoran
would
not
alter
nor
suffer
the
law
to
be
altered
therefore
he
did
not
hearken
to
those
who
had
sent
in
their
voices
with
their
petitions
concerning
the
altering
of
the
law

therefore
those
who
were
desirous
that
the
law
should
be
altered
were
angry
with
him
and
desired
that
he
should
no
longer
be
chief
judge
over
the
land
therefore
there
arose
a
warm
dispute
concerning
the
matter
but
not
unto
bloodshed

and
it
came
to
pass
that
those
who
were
desirous
that
pahoran
should
be
dethroned
from
the
judgmentseat
were
called
kingmen
for
they
were
desirous
that
the
law
should
be
altered
in
a
manner
to
overthrow
the
free
government
and
to
establish
a
king
over
the
land

and
those
who
were
desirous
that
pahoran
should
remain
chief
judge
over
the
land
took
upon
them
the
name
of
freemen
and
thus
was
the
division
among
them
for
the
freemen
had
sworn
or
covenanted
to
maintain
their
rights
and
the
privileges
of
their
religion
by
a
free
government

and
it
came
to
pass
that
this
matter
of
their
contention
was
settled
by
the
voice
of
the
people
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
people
came
in
favor
of
the
freemen
and
pahoran
retained
the
judgmentseat
which
caused
much
rejoicing
among
the
brethren
of
pahoran
and
also
many
of
the
people
of
liberty
who
also
put
the
kingmen
to
silence
that
they
durst
not
oppose
but
were
obliged
to
maintain
the
cause
of
freedom

now
those
who
were
in
favor
of
kings
were
those
of
high
birth
and
they
sought
to
be
kings
and
they
were
supported
by
those
who
sought
power
and
authority
over
the
people

but
behold
this
was
a
critical
time
for
such
contentions
to
be
among
the
people
of
nephi
for
behold
amalickiah
had
again
stirred
up
the
hearts
of
the
people
of
the
lamanites
against
the
people
of
the
nephites
and
he
was
gathering
together
soldiers
from
all
parts
of
his
land
and
arming
them
and
preparing
for
war
with
all
diligence
for
he
had
sworn
to
drink
the
blood
of
moroni

but
behold
we
shall
see
that
his
promise
which
he
made
was
rash
nevertheless
he
did
prepare
himself
and
his
armies
to
come
to
battle
against
the
nephites

now
his
armies
were
not
so
great
as
they
had
hitherto
been
because
of
the
many
thousands
who
had
been
slain
by
the
hand
of
the
nephites
but
notwithstanding
their
great
loss
amalickiah
had
gathered
together
a
wonderfully
great
army
insomuch
that
he
feared
not
to
come
down
to
the
land
of
zarahemla

yea
even
amalickiah
did
himself
come
down
at
the
head
of
the
lamanites
and
it
was
in
the
twenty
and
fifth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
and
it
was
at
the
same
time
that
they
had
begun
to
settle
the
affairs
of
their
contentions
concerning
the
chief
judge
pahoran

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
men
who
were
called
kingmen
had
heard
that
the
lamanites
were
coming
down
to
battle
against
them
they
were
glad
in
their
hearts
and
they
refused
to
take
up
arms
for
they
were
so
wroth
with
the
chief
judge
and
also
with
the
people
of
liberty
that
they
would
not
take
up
arms
to
defend
their
country

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
moroni
saw
this
and
also
saw
that
the
lamanites
were
coming
into
the
borders
of
the
land
he
was
exceedingly
wroth
because
of
the
stubbornness
of
those
people
whom
he
had
labored
with
so
much
diligence
to
preserve
yea
he
was
exceedingly
wroth
his
soul
was
filled
with
anger
against
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
sent
a
petition
with
the
voice
of
the
people
unto
the
governor
of
the
land
desiring
that
he
should
read
it
and
give
him
moroni
power
to
compel
those
dissenters
to
defend
their
country
or
to
put
them
to
death

for
it
was
his
first
care
to
put
an
end
to
such
contentions
and
dissensions
among
the
people
for
behold
this
had
been
hitherto
a
cause
of
all
their
destruction
and
it
came
to
pass
that
it
was
granted
according
to
the
voice
of
the
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
commanded
that
his
army
should
go
against
those
kingmen
to
pull
down
their
pride
and
their
nobility
and
level
them
with
the
earth
or
they
should
take
up
arms
and
support
the
cause
of
liberty

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
did
march
forth
against
them
and
they
did
pull
down
their
pride
and
their
nobility
insomuch
that
as
they
did
lift
their
weapons
of
war
to
fight
against
the
men
of
moroni
they
were
hewn
down
and
leveled
to
the
earth

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
four
thousand
of
those
dissenters
who
were
hewn
down
by
the
sword
and
those
of
their
leaders
who
were
not
slain
in
battle
were
taken
and
cast
into
prison
for
there
was
no
time
for
their
trials
at
this
period

and
the
remainder
of
those
dissenters
rather
than
be
smitten
down
to
the
earth
by
the
sword
yielded
to
the
standard
of
liberty
and
were
compelled
to
hoist
the
title
of
liberty
upon
their
towers
and
in
their
cities
and
to
take
up
arms
in
defence
of
their
country

and
thus
moroni
put
an
end
to
those
kingmen
that
there
were
not
any
known
by
the
appellation
of
kingmen
and
thus
he
put
an
end
to
the
stubbornness
and
the
pride
of
those
people
who
professed
the
blood
of
nobility
but
they
were
brought
down
to
humble
themselves
like
unto
their
brethren
and
to
fight
valiantly
for
their
freedom
from
bondage

behold
it
came
to
pass
that
while
moroni
was
thus
breaking
down
the
wars
and
contentions
among
his
own
people
and
subjecting
them
to
peace
and
civilization
and
making
regulations
to
prepare
for
war
against
the
lamanites
behold
the
lamanites
had
come
into
the
land
of
moroni
which
was
in
the
borders
by
the
seashore

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
nephites
were
not
sufficiently
strong
in
the
city
of
moroni
therefore
amalickiah
did
drive
them
slaying
many
and
it
came
to
pass
that
amalickiah
took
possession
of
the
city
yea
possession
of
all
their
fortifications

and
those
who
fled
out
of
the
city
of
moroni
came
to
the
city
of
nephihah
and
also
the
people
of
the
city
of
lehi
gathered
themselves
together
and
made
preparations
and
were
ready
to
receive
the
lamanites
to
battle

but
it
came
to
pass
that
amalickiah
would
not
suffer
the
lamanites
to
go
against
the
city
of
nephihah
to
battle
but
kept
them
down
by
the
seashore
leaving
men
in
every
city
to
maintain
and
defend
it

and
thus
he
went
on
taking
possession
of
many
cities
the
city
of
nephihah
and
the
city
of
lehi
and
the
city
of
morianton
and
the
city
of
omner
and
the
city
of
gid
and
the
city
of
mulek
all
of
which
were
on
the
east
borders
by
the
seashore

and
thus
had
the
lamanites
obtained
by
the
cunning
of
amalickiah
so
many
cities
by
their
numberless
hosts
all
of
which
were
strongly
fortified
after
the
manner
of
the
fortifications
of
moroni
all
of
which
afforded
strongholds
for
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
marched
to
the
borders
of
the
land
bountiful
driving
the
nephites
before
them
and
slaying
many

but
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
met
by
teancum
who
had
slain
morianton
and
had
headed
his
people
in
his
flight

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
headed
amalickiah
also
as
he
was
marching
forth
with
his
numerous
army
that
he
might
take
possession
of
the
land
bountiful
and
also
the
land
northward

but
behold
he
met
with
a
disappointment
by
being
repulsed
by
teancum
and
his
men
for
they
were
great
warriors
for
every
man
of
teancum
did
exceed
the
lamanites
in
their
strength
and
in
their
skill
of
war
insomuch
that
they
did
gain
advantage
over
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
harass
them
insomuch
that
they
did
slay
them
even
until
it
was
dark
and
it
came
to
pass
that
teancum
and
his
men
did
pitch
their
tents
in
the
borders
of
the
land
bountiful
and
amalickiah
did
pitch
his
tents
in
the
borders
on
the
beach
by
the
seashore
and
after
this
manner
were
they
driven

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
night
had
come
teancum
and
his
servant
stole
forth
and
went
out
by
night
and
went
into
the
camp
of
amalickiah
and
behold
sleep
had
overpowered
them
because
of
their
much
fatigue
which
was
caused
by
the
labors
and
heat
of
the
day

and
it
came
to
pass
that
teancum
stole
privily
into
the
tent
of
the
king
and
put
a
javelin
to
his
heart
and
he
did
cause
the
death
of
the
king
immediately
that
he
did
not
awake
his
servants

and
he
returned
again
privily
to
his
own
camp
and
behold
his
men
were
asleep
and
he
awoke
them
and
told
them
all
the
things
that
he
had
done

and
he
caused
that
his
armies
should
stand
in
readiness
lest
the
lamanites
had
awakened
and
should
come
upon
them

and
thus
endeth
the
twenty
and
fifth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
and
thus
endeth
the
days
of
amalickiah
alma
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
behold
when
the
lamanites
awoke
on
the
first
morning
of
the
first
month
behold
they
found
amalickiah
was
dead
in
his
own
tent
and
they
also
saw
that
teancum
was
ready
to
give
them
battle
on
that
day

and
now
when
the
lamanites
saw
this
they
were
affrighted
and
they
abandoned
their
design
in
marching
into
the
land
northward
and
retreated
with
all
their
army
into
the
city
of
mulek
and
sought
protection
in
their
fortifications

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
amalickiah
was
appointed
king
over
the
people
and
his
name
was
ammoron
thus
king
ammoron
the
brother
of
king
amalickiah
was
appointed
to
reign
in
his
stead

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
command
that
his
people
should
maintain
those
cities
which
they
had
taken
by
the
shedding
of
blood
for
they
had
not
taken
any
cities
save
they
had
lost
much
blood

and
now
teancum
saw
that
the
lamanites
were
determined
to
maintain
those
cities
which
they
had
taken
and
those
parts
of
the
land
which
they
had
obtained
possession
of
and
also
seeing
the
enormity
of
their
number
teancum
thought
it
was
not
expedient
that
he
should
attempt
to
attack
them
in
their
forts

but
he
kept
his
men
round
about
as
if
making
preparations
for
war
yea
and
truly
he
was
preparing
to
defend
himself
against
them
by
casting
up
walls
round
about
and
preparing
places
of
resort

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
kept
thus
preparing
for
war
until
moroni
had
sent
a
large
number
of
men
to
strengthen
his
army

and
moroni
also
sent
orders
unto
him
that
he
should
retain
all
the
prisoners
who
fell
into
his
hands
for
as
the
lamanites
had
taken
many
prisoners
that
he
should
retain
all
the
prisoners
of
the
lamanites
as
a
ransom
for
those
whom
the
lamanites
had
taken

and
he
also
sent
orders
unto
him
that
he
should
fortify
the
land
bountiful
and
secure
the
narrow
pass
which
led
into
the
land
northward
lest
the
lamanites
should
obtain
that
point
and
should
have
power
to
harass
them
on
every
side

and
moroni
also
sent
unto
him
desiring
him
that
he
would
be
faithful
in
maintaining
that
quarter
of
the
land
and
that
he
would
seek
every
opportunity
to
scourge
the
lamanites
in
that
quarter
as
much
as
was
in
his
power
that
perhaps
he
might
take
again
by
stratagem
or
some
other
way
those
cities
which
had
been
taken
out
of
their
hands
and
that
he
also
would
fortify
and
strengthen
the
cities
round
about
which
had
not
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
lamanites

and
he
also
said
unto
him
i
would
come
unto
you
but
behold
the
lamanites
are
upon
us
in
the
borders
of
the
land
by
the
west
sea
and
behold
i
go
against
them
therefore
i
cannot
come
unto
you

now
the
king
ammoron
had
departed
out
of
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
had
made
known
unto
the
queen
concerning
the
death
of
his
brother
and
had
gathered
together
a
large
number
of
men
and
had
marched
forth
against
the
nephites
on
the
borders
by
the
west
sea

and
thus
he
was
endeavoring
to
harass
the
nephites
and
to
draw
away
a
part
of
their
forces
to
that
part
of
the
land
while
he
had
commanded
those
whom
he
had
left
to
possess
the
cities
which
he
had
taken
that
they
should
also
harass
the
nephites
on
the
borders
by
the
east
sea
and
should
take
possession
of
their
lands
as
much
as
it
was
in
their
power
according
to
the
power
of
their
armies

and
thus
were
the
nephites
in
those
dangerous
circumstances
in
the
ending
of
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi

but
behold
it
came
to
pass
in
the
twenty
and
seventh
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
that
teancum
by
the
command
of
moroniwho
had
established
armies
to
protect
the
south
and
the
west
borders
of
the
land
and
had
begun
his
march
towards
the
land
bountiful
that
he
might
assist
teancum
with
his
men
in
retaking
the
cities
which
they
had
lost

and
it
came
to
pass
that
teancum
had
received
orders
to
make
an
attack
upon
the
city
of
mulek
and
retake
it
if
it
were
possible

and
it
came
to
pass
that
teancum
made
preparations
to
make
an
attack
upon
the
city
of
mulek
and
march
forth
with
his
army
against
the
lamanites
but
he
saw
that
it
was
impossible
that
he
could
overpower
them
while
they
were
in
their
fortifications
therefore
he
abandoned
his
designs
and
returned
again
to
the
city
bountiful
to
wait
for
the
coming
of
moroni
that
he
might
receive
strength
to
his
army

and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
did
arrive
with
his
army
at
the
land
of
bountiful
in
the
latter
end
of
the
twenty
and
seventh
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi

and
in
the
commencement
of
the
twenty
and
eighth
year
moroni
and
teancum
and
many
of
the
chief
captains
held
a
council
of
warwhat
they
should
do
to
cause
the
lamanites
to
come
out
against
them
to
battle
or
that
they
might
by
some
means
flatter
them
out
of
their
strongholds
that
they
might
gain
advantage
over
them
and
take
again
the
city
of
mulek

and
it
came
to
pass
they
sent
embassies
to
the
army
of
the
lamanites
which
protected
the
city
of
mulek
to
their
leader
whose
name
was
jacob
desiring
him
that
he
would
come
out
with
his
armies
to
meet
them
upon
the
plains
between
the
two
cities
but
behold
jacob
who
was
a
zoramite
would
not
come
out
with
his
army
to
meet
them
upon
the
plains

and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
having
no
hopes
of
meeting
them
upon
fair
grounds
therefore
he
resolved
upon
a
plan
that
he
might
decoy
the
lamanites
out
of
their
strongholds

therefore
he
caused
that
teancum
should
take
a
small
number
of
men
and
march
down
near
the
seashore
and
moroni
and
his
army
by
night
marched
in
the
wilderness
on
the
west
of
the
city
mulek
and
thus
on
the
morrow
when
the
guards
of
the
lamanites
had
discovered
teancum
they
ran
and
told
it
unto
jacob
their
leader

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
did
march
forth
against
teancum
supposing
by
their
numbers
to
overpower
teancum
because
of
the
smallness
of
his
numbers
and
as
teancum
saw
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
coming
out
against
him
he
began
to
retreat
down
by
the
seashore
northward

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lamanites
saw
that
he
began
to
flee
they
took
courage
and
pursued
them
with
vigor
and
while
teancum
was
thus
leading
away
the
lamanites
who
were
pursuing
them
in
vain
behold
moroni
commanded
that
a
part
of
his
army
who
were
with
him
should
march
forth
into
the
city
and
take
possession
of
it

and
thus
they
did
and
slew
all
those
who
had
been
left
to
protect
the
city
yea
all
those
who
would
not
yield
up
their
weapons
of
war

and
thus
moroni
had
obtained
possession
of
the
city
mulek
with
a
part
of
his
army
while
he
marched
with
the
remainder
to
meet
the
lamanites
when
they
should
return
from
the
pursuit
of
teancum

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
did
pursue
teancum
until
they
came
near
the
city
bountiful
and
then
they
were
met
by
lehi
and
a
small
army
which
had
been
left
to
protect
the
city
bountiful

and
now
behold
when
the
chief
captains
of
the
lamanites
had
beheld
lehi
with
his
army
coming
against
them
they
fled
in
much
confusion
lest
perhaps
they
should
not
obtain
the
city
mulek
before
lehi
should
overtake
them
for
they
were
wearied
because
of
their
march
and
the
men
of
lehi
were
fresh

now
the
lamanites
did
not
know
that
moroni
had
been
in
their
rear
with
his
army
and
all
they
feared
was
lehi
and
his
men

now
lehi
was
not
desirous
to
overtake
them
till
they
should
meet
moroni
and
his
army

and
it
came
to
pass
that
before
the
lamanites
had
retreated
far
they
were
surrounded
by
the
nephites
by
the
men
of
moroni
on
one
hand
and
the
men
of
lehi
on
the
other
all
of
whom
were
fresh
and
full
of
strength
but
the
lamanites
were
wearied
because
of
their
long
march

and
moroni
commanded
his
men
that
they
should
fall
upon
them
until
they
had
given
up
their
weapons
of
war

and
it
came
to
pass
that
jacob
being
their
leader
being
also
a
zoramite
and
having
an
unconquerable
spirit
he
led
the
lamanites
forth
to
battle
with
exceeding
fury
against
moroni

moroni
being
in
their
course
of
march
therefore
jacob
was
determined
to
slay
them
and
cut
his
way
through
to
the
city
of
mulek
but
behold
moroni
and
his
men
were
more
powerful
therefore
they
did
not
give
way
before
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
fought
on
both
hands
with
exceeding
fury
and
there
were
many
slain
on
both
sides
yea
and
moroni
was
wounded
and
jacob
was
killed

and
lehi
pressed
upon
their
rear
with
such
fury
with
his
strong
men
that
the
lamanites
in
the
rear
delivered
up
their
weapons
of
war
and
the
remainder
of
them
being
much
confused
knew
not
whither
to
go
or
to
strike

now
moroni
seeing
their
confusion
he
said
unto
them
if
ye
will
bring
forth
your
weapons
of
war
and
deliver
them
up
behold
we
will
forbear
shedding
your
blood

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lamanites
had
heard
these
words
their
chief
captains
all
those
who
were
not
slain
came
forth
and
threw
down
their
weapons
of
war
at
the
feet
of
moroni
and
also
commanded
their
men
that
they
should
do
the
same

but
behold
there
were
many
that
would
not
and
those
who
would
not
deliver
up
their
swords
were
taken
and
bound
and
their
weapons
of
war
were
taken
from
them
and
they
were
compelled
to
march
with
their
brethren
forth
into
the
land
bountiful

and
now
the
number
of
prisoners
who
were
taken
exceeded
more
than
the
number
of
those
who
had
been
slain
yea
more
than
those
who
had
been
slain
on
both
sides
alma
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
set
guards
over
the
prisoners
of
the
lamanites
and
did
compel
them
to
go
forth
and
bury
their
dead
yea
and
also
the
dead
of
the
nephites
who
were
slain
and
moroni
placed
men
over
them
to
guard
them
while
they
should
perform
their
labors

and
moroni
went
to
the
city
of
mulek
with
lehi
and
took
command
of
the
city
and
gave
it
unto
lehi
now
behold
this
lehi
was
a
man
who
had
been
with
moroni
in
the
more
part
of
all
his
battles
and
he
was
a
man
like
unto
moroni
and
they
rejoiced
in
each
others
safety
yea
they
were
beloved
by
each
other
and
also
beloved
by
all
the
people
of
nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
lamanites
had
finished
burying
their
dead
and
also
the
dead
of
the
nephites
they
were
marched
back
into
the
land
bountiful
and
teancum
by
the
orders
of
moroni
caused
that
they
should
commence
laboring
in
digging
a
ditch
round
about
the
land
or
the
city
bountiful

and
he
caused
that
they
should
build
a
breastwork
of
timbers
upon
the
inner
bank
of
the
ditch
and
they
cast
up
dirt
out
of
the
ditch
against
the
breastwork
of
timbers
and
thus
they
did
cause
the
lamanites
to
labor
until
they
had
encircled
the
city
of
bountiful
round
about
with
a
strong
wall
of
timbers
and
earth
to
an
exceeding
height

and
this
city
became
an
exceeding
stronghold
ever
after
and
in
this
city
they
did
guard
the
prisoners
of
the
lamanites
yea
even
within
a
wall
which
they
had
caused
them
to
build
with
their
own
hands
now
moroni
was
compelled
to
cause
the
lamanites
to
labor
because
it
was
easy
to
guard
them
while
at
their
labor
and
he
desired
all
his
forces
when
he
should
make
an
attack
upon
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
had
thus
gained
a
victory
over
one
of
the
greatest
of
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
and
had
obtained
possession
of
the
city
of
mulek
which
was
one
of
the
strongest
holds
of
the
lamanites
in
the
land
of
nephi
and
thus
he
had
also
built
a
stronghold
to
retain
his
prisoners

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
no
more
attempt
a
battle
with
the
lamanites
in
that
year
but
he
did
employ
his
men
in
preparing
for
war
yea
and
in
making
fortifications
to
guard
against
the
lamanites
yea
and
also
delivering
their
women
and
their
children
from
famine
and
affliction
and
providing
food
for
their
armies

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
on
the
west
sea
south
while
in
the
absence
of
moroni
on
account
of
some
intrigue
amongst
the
nephites
which
caused
dissensions
amongst
them
had
gained
some
ground
over
the
nephites
yea
insomuch
that
they
had
obtained
possession
of
a
number
of
their
cities
in
that
part
of
the
land

and
thus
because
of
iniquity
amongst
themselves
yea
because
of
dissensions
and
intrigue
among
themselves
they
were
placed
in
the
most
dangerous
circumstances

and
now
behold
i
have
somewhat
to
say
concerning
the
people
of
ammon
who
in
the
beginning
were
lamanites
but
by
ammon
and
his
brethren
or
rather
by
the
power
and
word
of
god
they
had
been
converted
unto
the
lord
and
they
had
been
brought
down
into
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
had
ever
since
been
protected
by
the
nephites

and
because
of
their
oath
they
had
been
kept
from
taking
up
arms
against
their
brethren
for
they
had
taken
an
oath
that
they
never
would
shed
blood
more
and
according
to
their
oath
they
would
have
perished
yea
they
would
have
suffered
themselves
to
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
their
brethren
had
it
not
been
for
the
pity
and
the
exceeding
love
which
ammon
and
his
brethren
had
had
for
them

and
for
this
cause
they
were
brought
down
into
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
they
ever
had
been
protected
by
the
nephites

but
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
saw
the
danger
and
the
many
afflictions
and
tribulations
which
the
nephites
bore
for
them
they
were
moved
with
compassion
and
were
desirous
to
take
up
arms
in
the
defence
of
their
country

but
behold
as
they
were
about
to
take
their
weapons
of
war
they
were
overpowered
by
the
persuasions
of
helaman
and
his
brethren
for
they
were
about
to
break
the
oath
which
they
had
made

and
helaman
feared
lest
by
so
doing
they
should
lose
their
souls
therefore
all
those
who
had
entered
into
this
covenant
were
compelled
to
behold
their
brethren
wade
through
their
afflictions
in
their
dangerous
circumstances
at
this
time

but
behold
it
came
to
pass
they
had
many
sons
who
had
not
entered
into
a
covenant
that
they
would
not
take
their
weapons
of
war
to
defend
themselves
against
their
enemies
therefore
they
did
assemble
themselves
together
at
this
time
as
many
as
were
able
to
take
up
arms
and
they
called
themselves
nephites

and
they
entered
into
a
covenant
to
fight
for
the
liberty
of
the
nephites
yea
to
protect
the
land
unto
the
laying
down
of
their
lives
yea
even
they
covenanted
that
they
never
would
give
up
their
liberty
but
they
would
fight
in
all
cases
to
protect
the
nephites
and
themselves
from
bondage

now
behold
there
were
two
thousand
of
those
young
men
who
entered
into
this
covenant
and
took
their
weapons
of
war
to
defend
their
country

and
now
behold
as
they
never
had
hitherto
been
a
disadvantage
to
the
nephites
they
became
now
at
this
period
of
time
also
a
great
support
for
they
took
their
weapons
of
war
and
they
would
that
helaman
should
be
their
leader

and
they
were
all
young
men
and
they
were
exceedingly
valiant
for
courage
and
also
for
strength
and
activity
but
behold
this
was
not
allthey
were
men
who
were
true
at
all
times
in
whatsoever
thing
they
were
entrusted

yea
they
were
men
of
truth
and
soberness
for
they
had
been
taught
to
keep
the
commandments
of
god
and
to
walk
uprightly
before
him

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
helaman
did
march
at
the
head
of
his
two
thousand
stripling
soldiers
to
the
support
of
the
people
in
the
borders
of
the
land
on
the
south
by
the
west
sea

and
thus
ended
the
twenty
and
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
alma
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
twenty
and
ninth
year
of
the
judges
that
ammoron
sent
unto
moroni
desiring
that
he
would
exchange
prisoners

and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
felt
to
rejoice
exceedingly
at
this
request
for
he
desired
the
provisions
which
were
imparted
for
the
support
of
the
lamanite
prisoners
for
the
support
of
his
own
people
and
he
also
desired
his
own
people
for
the
strengthening
of
his
army

now
the
lamanites
had
taken
many
women
and
children
and
there
was
not
a
woman
nor
a
child
among
all
the
prisoners
of
moroni
or
the
prisoners
whom
moroni
had
taken
therefore
moroni
resolved
upon
a
stratagem
to
obtain
as
many
prisoners
of
the
nephites
from
the
lamanites
as
it
were
possible

therefore
he
wrote
an
epistle
and
sent
it
by
the
servant
of
ammoron
the
same
who
had
brought
an
epistle
to
moroni
now
these
are
the
words
which
he
wrote
unto
ammoron
saying

behold
ammoron
i
have
written
unto
you
somewhat
concerning
this
war
which
ye
have
waged
against
my
people
or
rather
which
thy
brother
hath
waged
against
them
and
which
ye
are
still
determined
to
carry
on
after
his
death

behold
i
would
tell
you
somewhat
concerning
the
justice
of
god
and
the
sword
of
his
almighty
wrath
which
doth
hang
over
you
except
ye
repent
and
withdraw
your
armies
into
your
own
lands
or
the
land
of
your
possessions
which
is
the
land
of
nephi

yea
i
would
tell
you
these
things
if
ye
were
capable
of
hearkening
unto
them
yea
i
would
tell
you
concerning
that
awful
hell
that
awaits
to
receive
such
murderers
as
thou
and
thy
brother
have
been
except
ye
repent
and
withdraw
your
murderous
purposes
and
return
with
your
armies
to
your
own
lands

but
as
ye
have
once
rejected
these
things
and
have
fought
against
the
people
of
the
lord
even
so
i
may
expect
you
will
do
it
again

and
now
behold
we
are
prepared
to
receive
you
yea
and
except
you
withdraw
your
purposes
behold
ye
will
pull
down
the
wrath
of
that
god
whom
you
have
rejected
upon
you
even
to
your
utter
destruction

but
as
the
lord
liveth
our
armies
shall
come
upon
you
except
ye
withdraw
and
ye
shall
soon
be
visited
with
death
for
we
will
retain
our
cities
and
our
lands
yea
and
we
will
maintain
our
religion
and
the
cause
of
our
god

but
behold
it
supposeth
me
that
i
talk
to
you
concerning
these
things
in
vain
or
it
supposeth
me
that
thou
art
a
child
of
hell
therefore
i
will
close
my
epistle
by
telling
you
that
i
will
not
exchange
prisoners
save
it
be
on
conditions
that
ye
will
deliver
up
a
man
and
his
wife
and
his
children
for
one
prisoner
if
this
be
the
case
that
ye
will
do
it
i
will
exchange

and
behold
if
you
do
not
this
i
will
come
against
you
with
my
armies
yea
even
i
will
arm
my
women
and
my
children
and
i
will
come
against
you
and
i
will
follow
you
even
into
your
own
land
which
is
the
land
of
our
first
inheritance
yea
and
it
shall
be
blood
for
blood
yea
life
for
life
and
i
will
give
you
battle
even
until
you
are
destroyed
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth

behold
i
am
in
my
anger
and
also
my
people
ye
have
sought
to
murder
us
and
we
have
only
sought
to
defend
ourselves
but
behold
if
ye
seek
to
destroy
us
more
we
will
seek
to
destroy
you
yea
and
we
will
seek
our
land
the
land
of
our
first
inheritance

now
i
close
my
epistle
i
am
moroni
i
am
a
leader
of
the
people
of
the
nephites

now
it
came
to
pass
that
ammoron
when
he
had
received
this
epistle
was
angry
and
he
wrote
another
epistle
unto
moroni
and
these
are
the
words
which
he
wrote
saying

i
am
ammoron
the
king
of
the
lamanites
i
am
the
brother
of
amalickiah
whom
ye
have
murdered
behold
i
will
avenge
his
blood
upon
you
yea
and
i
will
come
upon
you
with
my
armies
for
i
fear
not
your
threatenings

for
behold
your
fathers
did
wrong
their
brethren
insomuch
that
they
did
rob
them
of
their
right
to
the
government
when
it
rightly
belonged
unto
them

and
now
behold
if
ye
will
lay
down
your
arms
and
subject
yourselves
to
be
governed
by
those
to
whom
the
government
doth
rightly
belong
then
will
i
cause
that
my
people
shall
lay
down
their
weapons
and
shall
be
at
war
no
more

behold
ye
have
breathed
out
many
threatenings
against
me
and
my
people
but
behold
we
fear
not
your
threatenings

nevertheless
i
will
grant
to
exchange
prisoners
according
to
your
request
gladly
that
i
may
preserve
my
food
for
my
men
of
war
and
we
will
wage
a
war
which
shall
be
eternal
either
to
the
subjecting
the
nephites
to
our
authority
or
to
their
eternal
extinction

and
as
concerning
that
god
whom
ye
say
we
have
rejected
behold
we
know
not
such
a
being
neither
do
ye
but
if
it
so
be
that
there
is
such
a
thing
we
know
not
but
that
he
hath
made
us
as
well
as
you

and
if
it
so
be
that
there
is
a
devil
and
a
hell
behold
will
he
not
send
you
there
to
dwell
with
my
brother
whom
ye
have
murdered
whom
ye
have
hinted
that
he
hath
gone
to
such
a
place
but
behold
these
things
matter
not

i
am
ammoron
and
a
descendant
of
zoram
whom
your
fathers
pressed
and
brought
out
of
jerusalem

and
behold
now
i
am
a
bold
lamanite
behold
this
war
hath
been
waged
to
avenge
their
wrongs
and
to
maintain
and
to
obtain
their
rights
to
the
government
and
i
close
my
epistle
to
moroni
alma
chapter


now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
moroni
had
received
this
epistle
he
was
more
angry
because
he
knew
that
ammoron
had
a
perfect
knowledge
of
his
fraud
yea
he
knew
that
ammoron
knew
that
it
was
not
a
just
cause
that
had
caused
him
to
wage
a
war
against
the
people
of
nephi

and
he
said
behold
i
will
not
exchange
prisoners
with
ammoron
save
he
will
withdraw
his
purpose
as
i
have
stated
in
my
epistle
for
i
will
not
grant
unto
him
that
he
shall
have
any
more
power
than
what
he
hath
got

behold
i
know
the
place
where
the
lamanites
do
guard
my
people
whom
they
have
taken
prisoners
and
as
ammoron
would
not
grant
unto
me
mine
epistle
behold
i
will
give
unto
him
according
to
my
words
yea
i
will
seek
death
among
them
until
they
shall
sue
for
peace

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
moroni
had
said
these
words
he
caused
that
a
search
should
be
made
among
his
men
that
perhaps
he
might
find
a
man
who
was
a
descendant
of
laman
among
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
found
one
whose
name
was
laman
and
he
was
one
of
the
servants
of
the
king
who
was
murdered
by
amalickiah

now
moroni
caused
that
laman
and
a
small
number
of
his
men
should
go
forth
unto
the
guards
who
were
over
the
nephites

now
the
nephites
were
guarded
in
the
city
of
gid
therefore
moroni
appointed
laman
and
caused
that
a
small
number
of
men
should
go
with
him

and
when
it
was
evening
laman
went
to
the
guards
who
were
over
the
nephites
and
behold
they
saw
him
coming
and
they
hailed
him
but
he
saith
unto
them
fear
not
behold
i
am
a
lamanite
behold
we
have
escaped
from
the
nephites
and
they
sleep
and
behold
we
have
taken
of
their
wine
and
brought
with
us

now
when
the
lamanites
heard
these
words
they
received
him
with
joy
and
they
said
unto
him
give
us
of
your
wine
that
we
may
drink
we
are
glad
that
ye
have
thus
taken
wine
with
you
for
we
are
weary

but
laman
said
unto
them
let
us
keep
of
our
wine
till
we
go
against
the
nephites
to
battle
but
this
saying
only
made
them
more
desirous
to
drink
of
the
wine

for
said
they
we
are
weary
therefore
let
us
take
of
the
wine
and
by
and
by
we
shall
receive
wine
for
our
rations
which
will
strengthen
us
to
go
against
the
nephites

and
laman
said
unto
them
you
may
do
according
to
your
desires

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
take
of
the
wine
freely
and
it
was
pleasant
to
their
taste
therefore
they
took
of
it
more
freely
and
it
was
strong
having
been
prepared
in
its
strength

and
it
came
to
pass
they
did
drink
and
were
merry
and
by
and
by
they
were
all
drunken

and
now
when
laman
and
his
men
saw
that
they
were
all
drunken
and
were
in
a
deep
sleep
they
returned
to
moroni
and
told
him
all
the
things
that
had
happened

and
now
this
was
according
to
the
design
of
moroni
and
moroni
had
prepared
his
men
with
weapons
of
war
and
he
went
to
the
city
gid
while
the
lamanites
were
in
a
deep
sleep
and
drunken
and
cast
in
weapons
of
war
unto
the
prisoners
insomuch
that
they
were
all
armed

yea
even
to
their
women
and
all
those
of
their
children
as
many
as
were
able
to
use
a
weapon
of
war
when
moroni
had
armed
all
those
prisoners
and
all
those
things
were
done
in
a
profound
silence

but
had
they
awakened
the
lamanites
behold
they
were
drunken
and
the
nephites
could
have
slain
them

but
behold
this
was
not
the
desire
of
moroni
he
did
not
delight
in
murder
or
bloodshed
but
he
delighted
in
the
saving
of
his
people
from
destruction
and
for
this
cause
he
might
not
bring
upon
him
injustice
he
would
not
fall
upon
the
lamanites
and
destroy
them
in
their
drunkenness

but
he
had
obtained
his
desires
for
he
had
armed
those
prisoners
of
the
nephites
who
were
within
the
wall
of
the
city
and
had
given
them
power
to
gain
possession
of
those
parts
which
were
within
the
walls

and
then
he
caused
the
men
who
were
with
him
to
withdraw
a
pace
from
them
and
surround
the
armies
of
the
lamanites

now
behold
this
was
done
in
the
nighttime
so
that
when
the
lamanites
awoke
in
the
morning
they
beheld
that
they
were
surrounded
by
the
nephites
without
and
that
their
prisoners
were
armed
within

and
thus
they
saw
that
the
nephites
had
power
over
them
and
in
these
circumstances
they
found
that
it
was
not
expedient
that
they
should
fight
with
the
nephites
therefore
their
chief
captains
demanded
their
weapons
of
war
and
they
brought
them
forth
and
cast
them
at
the
feet
of
the
nephites
pleading
for
mercy

now
behold
this
was
the
desire
of
moroni
he
took
them
prisoners
of
war
and
took
possession
of
the
city
and
caused
that
all
the
prisoners
should
be
liberated
who
were
nephites
and
they
did
join
the
army
of
moroni
and
were
a
great
strength
to
his
army

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
cause
the
lamanites
whom
he
had
taken
prisoners
that
they
should
commence
a
labor
in
strengthening
the
fortifications
round
about
the
city
gid

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
fortified
the
city
gid
according
to
his
desires
he
caused
that
his
prisoners
should
be
taken
to
the
city
bountiful
and
he
also
guarded
that
city
with
an
exceedingly
strong
force

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
notwithstanding
all
the
intrigues
of
the
lamanites
keep
and
protect
all
the
prisoners
whom
they
had
taken
and
also
maintain
all
the
ground
and
the
advantage
which
they
had
retaken

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
nephites
began
again
to
be
victorious
and
to
reclaim
their
rights
and
their
privileges

many
time
did
the
lamanites
attempt
to
encircle
them
about
by
night
but
in
these
attempts
they
did
lose
many
prisoners

and
many
times
did
they
attempt
to
administer
of
their
wine
to
the
nephites
that
they
might
destroy
them
with
poison
or
with
drunkenness

but
behold
the
nephites
were
not
slow
to
remember
the
lord
their
god
in
this
their
time
of
affliction
they
could
not
be
taken
in
their
snares
yea
they
would
not
partake
of
their
wine
save
they
had
first
given
to
some
of
the
lamanite
prisoners

and
they
were
thus
cautious
that
no
poison
should
be
administered
among
them
for
if
their
wine
would
poison
a
lamanite
it
would
also
poison
a
nephite
and
thus
they
did
try
all
their
liquors

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
it
was
expedient
for
moroni
to
make
preparations
to
attack
the
city
morianton
for
behold
the
lamanites
had
by
their
labors
fortified
the
city
morianton
until
it
had
become
an
exceeding
stronghold

and
they
were
continually
bringing
new
forces
into
that
city
and
also
new
supplies
of
provisions

and
thus
ended
the
twenty
and
ninth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
alma
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
thirtieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
on
the
second
day
in
the
first
month
moroni
received
an
epistle
from
helaman
stating
the
affairs
of
the
people
in
that
quarter
of
the
land

and
these
are
the
words
which
he
wrote
saying
my
dearly
beloved
brother
moroni
as
well
in
the
lord
as
in
the
tribulations
of
our
warfare
behold
my
beloved
brother
i
have
somewhat
to
tell
you
concerning
our
warfare
in
this
part
of
the
land

behold
two
thousand
of
the
sons
of
those
men
whom
ammon
brought
down
out
of
the
land
of
nephinow
ye
have
known
that
these
were
descendants
of
laman
who
was
the
eldest
son
of
our
father
lehi

now
i
need
not
rehearse
unto
you
concerning
their
traditions
or
their
unbelief
for
thou
knowest
concerning
all
these
things

therefore
it
sufficeth
me
that
i
tell
you
that
two
thousand
of
these
young
men
have
taken
their
weapons
of
war
and
would
that
i
should
be
their
leader
and
we
have
come
forth
to
defend
our
country

and
now
ye
also
know
concerning
the
covenant
which
their
fathers
made
that
they
would
not
take
up
their
weapons
of
war
against
their
brethren
to
shed
blood

but
in
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
when
they
saw
our
afflictions
and
our
tribulations
for
them
they
were
about
to
break
the
covenant
which
they
had
made
and
take
up
their
weapons
of
war
in
our
defence

but
i
would
not
suffer
them
that
they
should
break
this
covenant
which
they
had
made
supposing
that
god
would
strengthen
us
insomuch
that
we
should
not
suffer
more
because
of
the
fulfilling
the
oath
which
they
had
taken

but
behold
here
is
one
thing
in
which
we
may
have
great
joy
for
behold
in
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
i
helaman
did
march
at
the
head
of
these
two
thousand
young
men
to
the
city
of
judea
to
assist
antipus
whom
ye
had
appointed
a
leader
over
the
people
of
that
part
of
the
land

and
i
did
join
my
two
thousand
sons
for
they
are
worthy
to
be
called
sons
to
the
army
of
antipus
in
which
strength
antipus
did
rejoice
exceedingly
for
behold
his
army
had
been
reduced
by
the
lamanites
because
their
forces
had
slain
a
vast
number
of
our
men
for
which
cause
we
have
to
mourn

nevertheless
we
may
console
ourselves
in
this
point
that
they
have
died
in
the
cause
of
their
country
and
of
their
god
yea
and
they
are
happy

and
the
lamanites
had
also
retained
many
prisoners
all
of
whom
are
chief
captains
for
none
other
have
they
spared
alive
and
we
suppose
that
they
are
now
at
this
time
in
the
land
of
nephi
it
is
so
if
they
are
not
slain

and
now
these
are
the
cities
of
which
the
lamanites
have
obtained
possession
by
the
shedding
of
the
blood
of
so
many
of
our
valiant
men

the
land
of
manti
or
the
city
of
manti
and
the
city
of
zeezrom
and
the
city
of
cumeni
and
the
city
of
antiparah

and
these
are
the
cities
which
they
possessed
when
i
arrived
at
the
city
of
judea
and
i
found
antipus
and
his
men
toiling
with
their
might
to
fortify
the
city

yea
and
they
were
depressed
in
body
as
well
as
in
spirit
for
they
had
fought
valiantly
by
day
and
toiled
by
night
to
maintain
their
cities
and
thus
they
had
suffered
great
afflictions
of
every
kind

and
now
they
were
determined
to
conquer
in
this
place
or
die
therefore
you
may
well
suppose
that
this
little
force
which
i
brought
with
me
yea
those
sons
of
mine
gave
them
great
hopes
and
much
joy

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lamanites
saw
that
antipus
had
received
a
greater
strength
to
his
army
they
were
compelled
by
the
orders
of
ammoron
to
not
come
against
the
city
of
judea
or
against
us
to
battle

and
thus
were
we
favored
of
the
lord
for
had
they
come
upon
us
in
this
our
weakness
they
might
have
perhaps
destroyed
our
little
army
but
thus
were
we
preserved

they
were
commanded
by
ammoron
to
maintain
those
cities
which
they
had
taken
and
thus
ended
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
and
in
the
commencement
of
the
twenty
and
seventh
year
we
had
prepared
our
city
and
ourselves
for
defence

now
we
were
desirous
that
the
lamanites
should
come
upon
us
for
we
were
not
desirous
to
make
an
attack
upon
them
in
their
strongholds

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
kept
spies
out
round
about
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
lamanites
that
they
might
not
pass
us
by
night
nor
by
day
to
make
an
attack
upon
our
other
cities
which
were
on
the
northward

for
we
knew
in
those
cities
they
were
not
sufficiently
strong
to
meet
them
therefore
we
were
desirous
if
they
should
pass
by
us
to
fall
upon
them
in
their
rear
and
thus
bring
them
up
in
the
rear
at
the
same
time
they
were
met
in
the
front
we
supposed
that
we
could
overpower
them
but
behold
we
were
disappointed
in
this
our
desire

they
durst
not
pass
by
us
with
their
whole
army
neither
durst
they
with
a
part
lest
they
should
not
be
sufficiently
strong
and
they
should
fall

neither
durst
they
march
down
against
the
city
of
zarahemla
neither
durst
they
cross
the
head
of
sidon
over
to
the
city
of
nephihah

and
thus
with
their
forces
they
were
determined
to
maintain
those
cities
which
they
had
taken

and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
second
month
of
this
year
there
was
brought
unto
us
many
provisions
from
the
fathers
of
those
my
two
thousand
sons

and
also
there
were
sent
two
thousand
men
unto
us
from
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
thus
we
were
prepared
with
ten
thousand
men
and
provisions
for
them
and
also
for
their
wives
and
their
children

and
the
lamanites
thus
seeing
our
forces
increase
daily
and
provisions
arrive
for
our
support
they
began
to
be
fearful
and
began
to
sally
forth
if
it
were
possible
to
put
an
end
to
our
receiving
provisions
and
strength

now
when
we
saw
that
the
lamanites
began
to
grow
uneasy
on
this
wise
we
were
desirous
to
bring
a
stratagem
into
effect
upon
them
therefore
antipus
ordered
that
i
should
march
forth
with
my
little
sons
to
a
neighboring
city
as
if
we
were
carrying
provisions
to
a
neighboring
city

and
we
were
to
march
near
the
city
of
antiparah
as
if
we
were
going
to
the
city
beyond
in
the
borders
by
the
seashore

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
march
forth
as
if
with
our
provisions
to
go
to
that
city

and
it
came
to
pass
that
antipus
did
march
forth
with
a
part
of
his
army
leaving
the
remainder
to
maintain
the
city
but
he
did
not
march
forth
until
i
had
gone
forth
with
my
little
army
and
came
near
the
city
antiparah

and
now
in
the
city
antiparah
were
stationed
the
strongest
army
of
the
lamanites
yea
the
most
numerous

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
been
informed
by
their
spies
they
came
forth
with
their
army
and
marched
against
us

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
flee
before
them
northward
and
thus
we
did
lead
away
the
most
powerful
army
of
the
lamanites

yea
even
to
a
considerable
distance
insomuch
that
when
they
saw
the
army
of
antipus
pursuing
them
with
their
might
they
did
not
turn
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
but
pursued
their
march
in
a
straight
course
after
us
and
as
we
suppose
it
was
their
intent
to
slay
us
before
antipus
should
overtake
them
and
this
that
they
might
not
be
surrounded
by
our
people

and
now
antipus
beholding
our
danger
did
speed
the
march
of
his
army
but
behold
it
was
night
therefore
they
did
not
overtake
us
neither
did
antipus
overtake
them
therefore
we
did
camp
for
the
night

and
it
came
to
pass
that
before
the
dawn
of
the
morning
behold
the
lamanites
were
pursuing
us
now
we
were
not
sufficiently
strong
to
contend
with
them
yea
i
would
not
suffer
that
my
little
sons
should
fall
into
their
hands
therefore
we
did
continue
our
march
and
we
took
our
march
into
the
wilderness

now
they
durst
not
turn
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
lest
they
should
be
surrounded
neither
would
i
turn
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
lest
they
should
overtake
me
and
we
could
not
stand
against
them
but
be
slain
and
they
would
make
their
escape
and
thus
we
did
flee
all
that
day
into
the
wilderness
even
until
it
was
dark

and
it
came
to
pass
that
again
when
the
light
of
the
morning
came
we
saw
the
lamanites
upon
us
and
we
did
flee
before
them

but
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
not
pursue
us
far
before
they
halted
and
it
was
in
the
morning
of
the
third
day
of
the
seventh
month

and
now
whether
they
were
overtaken
by
antipus
we
knew
not
but
i
said
unto
my
men
behold
we
know
not
but
they
have
halted
for
the
purpose
that
we
should
come
against
them
that
they
might
catch
us
in
their
snare

therefore
what
say
ye
my
sons
will
ye
go
against
them
to
battle

and
now
i
say
unto
you
my
beloved
brother
moroni
that
never
had
i
seen
so
great
courage
nay
not
amongst
all
the
nephites

for
as
i
had
ever
called
them
my
sons
for
they
were
all
of
them
very
young
even
so
they
said
unto
me
father
behold
our
god
is
with
us
and
he
will
not
suffer
that
we
should
fall
then
let
us
go
forth
we
would
not
slay
our
brethren
if
they
would
let
us
alone
therefore
let
us
go
lest
they
should
overpower
the
army
of
antipus

now
they
never
had
fought
yet
they
did
not
fear
death
and
they
did
think
more
upon
the
liberty
of
their
fathers
than
they
did
upon
their
lives
yea
they
had
been
taught
by
their
mothers
that
if
they
did
not
doubt
god
would
deliver
them

and
they
rehearsed
unto
me
the
words
of
their
mothers
saying
we
do
not
doubt
our
mothers
knew
it

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
did
return
with
my
two
thousand
against
these
lamanites
who
had
pursued
us
and
now
behold
the
armies
of
antipus
had
overtaken
them
and
a
terrible
battle
had
commenced

the
army
of
antipus
being
weary
because
of
their
long
march
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
were
about
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
lamanites
and
had
i
not
returned
with
my
two
thousand
they
would
have
obtained
their
purpose

for
antipus
had
fallen
by
the
sword
and
many
of
his
leaders
because
of
their
weariness
which
was
occasioned
by
the
speed
of
their
marchtherefore
the
men
of
antipus
being
confused
because
of
the
fall
of
their
leaders
began
to
give
way
before
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
took
courage
and
began
to
pursue
them
and
thus
were
the
lamanites
pursuing
them
with
great
vigor
when
helaman
came
upon
their
rear
with
his
two
thousand
and
began
to
slay
them
exceedingly
insomuch
that
the
whole
army
of
the
lamanites
halted
and
turned
upon
helaman

now
when
the
people
of
antipus
saw
that
the
lamanites
had
turned
them
about
they
gathered
together
their
men
and
came
again
upon
the
rear
of
the
lamanites

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
we
the
people
of
nephi
the
people
of
antipus
and
i
with
my
two
thousand
did
surround
the
lamanites
and
did
slay
them
yea
insomuch
that
they
were
compelled
to
deliver
up
their
weapons
of
war
and
also
themselves
as
prisoners
of
war

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
surrendered
themselves
up
unto
us
behold
i
numbered
those
young
men
who
had
fought
with
me
fearing
lest
there
were
many
of
them
slain

but
behold
to
my
great
joy
there
had
not
one
soul
of
them
fallen
to
the
earth
yea
and
they
had
fought
as
if
with
the
strength
of
god
yea
never
were
men
known
to
have
fought
with
such
miraculous
strength
and
with
such
mighty
power
did
they
fall
upon
the
lamanites
that
they
did
frighten
them
and
for
this
cause
did
the
lamanites
deliver
themselves
up
as
prisoners
of
war

and
as
we
had
no
place
for
our
prisoners
that
we
could
guard
them
to
keep
them
from
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
therefore
we
sent
them
to
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
a
part
of
those
men
who
were
not
slain
of
antipus
with
them
and
the
remainder
i
took
and
joined
them
to
my
stripling
ammonites
and
took
our
march
back
to
the
city
of
judea
alma
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
i
received
an
epistle
from
ammoron
the
king
stating
that
if
i
would
deliver
up
those
prisoners
of
war
whom
we
had
taken
that
he
would
deliver
up
the
city
of
antiparah
unto
us

but
i
sent
an
epistle
unto
the
king
that
we
were
sure
our
forces
were
sufficient
to
take
the
city
of
antiparah
by
our
force
and
by
delivering
up
the
prisoners
for
that
city
we
should
suppose
ourselves
unwise
and
that
we
would
only
deliver
up
our
prisoners
on
exchange

and
ammoron
refused
mine
epistle
for
he
would
not
exchange
prisoners
therefore
we
began
to
make
preparations
to
go
against
the
city
of
antiparah

but
the
people
of
antiparah
did
leave
the
city
and
fled
to
their
other
cities
which
they
had
possession
of
to
fortify
them
and
thus
the
city
of
antiparah
fell
into
our
hands

and
thus
ended
the
twenty
and
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
commencement
of
the
twenty
and
ninth
year
we
received
a
supply
of
provisions
and
also
an
addition
to
our
army
from
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
from
the
land
round
about
to
the
number
of
six
thousand
men
besides
sixty
of
the
sons
of
the
ammonites
who
had
come
to
join
their
brethren
my
little
band
of
two
thousand
and
now
behold
we
were
strong
yea
and
we
had
also
plenty
of
provisions
brought
unto
us

and
it
came
to
pass
that
it
was
our
desire
to
wage
a
battle
with
the
army
which
was
placed
to
protect
the
city
cumeni

and
now
behold
i
will
show
unto
you
that
we
soon
accomplished
our
desire
yea
with
our
strong
force
or
with
a
part
of
our
strong
force
we
did
surround
by
night
the
city
cumeni
a
little
before
they
were
to
receive
a
supply
of
provisions

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
camp
round
about
the
city
for
many
nights
but
we
did
sleep
upon
our
swords
and
keep
guards
that
the
lamanites
could
not
come
upon
us
by
night
and
slay
us
which
they
attempted
many
times
but
as
many
times
as
they
attempted
this
their
blood
was
spilt

at
length
their
provisions
did
arrive
and
they
were
about
to
enter
the
city
by
night
and
we
instead
of
being
lamanites
were
nephites
therefore
we
did
take
them
and
their
provisions

and
notwithstanding
the
lamanites
being
cut
off
from
their
support
after
this
manner
they
were
still
determined
to
maintain
the
city
therefore
it
became
expedient
that
we
should
take
those
provisions
and
send
them
to
judea
and
our
prisoners
to
the
land
of
zarahemla

and
it
came
to
pass
that
not
many
days
had
passed
away
before
the
lamanites
began
to
lose
all
hopes
of
succor
therefore
they
yielded
up
the
city
unto
our
hands
and
thus
we
had
accomplished
our
designs
in
obtaining
the
city
cumeni

but
it
came
to
pass
that
our
prisoners
were
so
numerous
that
notwithstanding
the
enormity
of
our
numbers
we
were
obliged
to
employ
all
our
force
to
keep
them
or
to
put
them
to
death

for
behold
they
would
break
out
in
great
numbers
and
would
fight
with
stones
and
with
clubs
or
whatsoever
thing
they
could
get
into
their
hands
insomuch
that
we
did
slay
upwards
of
two
thousand
of
them
after
they
had
surrendered
themselves
prisoners
of
war

therefore
it
became
expedient
for
us
that
we
should
put
an
end
to
their
lives
or
guard
them
sword
in
hand
down
to
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
also
our
provisions
were
not
any
more
than
sufficient
for
our
own
people
notwithstanding
that
which
we
had
taken
from
the
lamanites

and
now
in
those
critical
circumstances
it
became
a
very
serious
matter
to
determine
concerning
these
prisoners
of
war
nevertheless
we
did
resolve
to
send
them
down
to
the
land
of
zarahemla
therefore
we
selected
a
part
of
our
men
and
gave
them
charge
over
our
prisoners
to
go
down
to
the
land
of
zarahemla

but
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
they
did
return
and
now
behold
we
did
not
inquire
of
them
concerning
the
prisoners
for
behold
the
lamanites
were
upon
us
and
they
returned
in
season
to
save
us
from
falling
into
their
hands
for
behold
ammoron
had
sent
to
their
support
a
new
supply
of
provisions
and
also
a
numerous
army
of
men

and
it
came
to
pass
that
those
men
whom
we
sent
with
the
prisoners
did
arrive
in
season
to
check
them
as
they
were
about
to
overpower
us

but
behold
my
little
band
of
two
thousand
and
sixty
fought
most
desperately
yea
they
were
firm
before
the
lamanites
and
did
administer
death
unto
all
those
who
opposed
them

and
as
the
remainder
of
our
army
were
about
to
give
way
before
the
lamanites
behold
those
two
thousand
and
sixty
were
firm
and
undaunted

yea
and
they
did
obey
and
observe
to
perform
every
word
of
command
with
exactness
yea
and
even
according
to
their
faith
it
was
done
unto
them
and
i
did
remember
the
words
which
they
said
unto
me
that
their
mothers
had
taught
them

and
now
behold
it
was
these
my
sons
and
those
men
who
had
been
selected
to
convey
the
prisoners
to
whom
we
owe
this
great
victory
for
it
was
they
who
did
beat
the
lamanites
therefore
they
were
driven
back
to
the
city
of
manti

and
we
retained
our
city
cumeni
and
were
not
all
destroyed
by
the
sword
nevertheless
we
had
suffered
great
loss

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
lamanites
had
fled
i
immediately
gave
orders
that
my
men
who
had
been
wounded
should
be
taken
from
among
the
dead
and
caused
that
their
wounds
should
be
dressed

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
two
hundred
out
of
my
two
thousand
and
sixty
who
had
fainted
because
of
the
loss
of
blood
nevertheless
according
to
the
goodness
of
god
and
to
our
great
astonishment
and
also
the
joy
of
our
whole
army
there
was
not
one
soul
of
them
who
did
perish
yea
and
neither
was
there
one
soul
among
them
who
had
not
received
many
wounds

and
now
their
preservation
was
astonishing
to
our
whole
army
yea
that
they
should
be
spared
while
there
was
a
thousand
of
our
brethren
who
were
slain
and
we
do
justly
ascribe
it
to
the
miraculous
power
of
god
because
of
their
exceeding
faith
in
that
which
they
had
been
taught
to
believethat
there
was
a
just
god
and
whosoever
did
not
doubt
that
they
should
be
preserved
by
his
marvelous
power

now
this
was
the
faith
of
these
of
whom
i
have
spoken
they
are
young
and
their
minds
are
firm
and
they
do
put
their
trust
in
god
continually

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
we
had
thus
taken
care
of
our
wounded
men
and
had
buried
our
dead
and
also
the
dead
of
the
lamanites
who
were
many
behold
we
did
inquire
of
gid
concerning
the
prisoners
whom
they
had
started
to
go
down
to
the
land
of
zarahemla
with

now
gid
was
the
chief
captain
over
the
band
who
was
appointed
to
guard
them
down
to
the
land

and
now
these
are
the
words
which
gid
said
unto
me
behold
we
did
start
to
go
down
to
the
land
of
zarahemla
with
our
prisoners
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
meet
the
spies
of
our
armies
who
had
been
sent
out
to
watch
the
camp
of
the
lamanites

and
they
cried
unto
us
sayingbehold
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
are
marching
towards
the
city
of
cumeni
and
behold
they
will
fall
upon
them
yea
and
will
destroy
our
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
our
prisoners
did
hear
their
cries
which
caused
them
to
take
courage
and
they
did
rise
up
in
rebellion
against
us

and
it
came
to
pass
because
of
their
rebellion
we
did
cause
that
our
swords
should
come
upon
them
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
in
a
body
run
upon
our
swords
in
the
which
the
greater
number
of
them
were
slain
and
the
remainder
of
them
broke
through
and
fled
from
us

and
behold
when
they
had
fled
and
we
could
not
overtake
them
we
took
our
march
with
speed
towards
the
city
cumeni
and
behold
we
did
arrive
in
time
that
we
might
assist
our
brethren
in
preserving
the
city

and
behold
we
are
again
delivered
out
of
the
hands
of
our
enemies
and
blessed
is
the
name
of
our
god
for
behold
it
is
he
that
has
delivered
us
yea
that
has
done
this
great
thing
for
us

now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
i
helaman
had
heard
these
words
of
gid
i
was
filled
with
exceeding
joy
because
of
the
goodness
of
god
in
preserving
us
that
we
might
not
all
perish
yea
and
i
trust
that
the
souls
of
them
who
have
been
slain
have
entered
into
the
rest
of
their
god
alma
chapter


and
behold
now
it
came
to
pass
that
our
next
object
was
to
obtain
the
city
of
manti
but
behold
there
was
no
way
that
we
could
lead
them
out
of
the
city
by
our
small
bands
for
behold
they
remembered
that
which
we
had
hitherto
done
therefore
we
could
not
decoy
them
away
from
their
strongholds

and
they
were
so
much
more
numerous
than
was
our
army
that
we
durst
not
go
forth
and
attack
them
in
their
strongholds

yea
and
it
became
expedient
that
we
should
employ
our
men
to
the
maintaining
those
parts
of
the
land
which
we
had
regained
of
our
possessions
therefore
it
became
expedient
that
we
should
wait
that
we
might
receive
more
strength
from
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
also
a
new
supply
of
provisions

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
thus
did
send
an
embassy
to
the
governor
of
our
land
to
acquaint
him
concerning
the
affairs
of
our
people
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
wait
to
receive
provisions
and
strength
from
the
land
of
zarahemla

but
behold
this
did
profit
us
but
little
for
the
lamanites
were
also
receiving
great
strength
from
day
to
day
and
also
many
provisions
and
thus
were
our
circumstances
at
this
period
of
time

and
the
lamanites
were
sallying
forth
against
us
from
time
to
time
resolving
by
stratagem
to
destroy
us
nevertheless
we
could
not
come
to
battle
with
them
because
of
their
retreats
and
their
strongholds

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
wait
in
these
difficult
circumstances
for
the
space
of
many
months
even
until
we
were
about
to
perish
for
the
want
of
food

but
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
receive
food
which
was
guarded
to
us
by
an
army
of
two
thousand
men
to
our
assistance
and
this
is
all
the
assistance
which
we
did
receive
to
defend
ourselves
and
our
country
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
our
enemies
yea
to
contend
with
an
enemy
which
was
innumerable

and
now
the
cause
of
these
our
embarrassments
or
the
cause
why
they
did
not
send
more
strength
unto
us
we
knew
not
therefore
we
were
grieved
and
also
filled
with
fear
lest
by
any
means
the
judgments
of
god
should
come
upon
our
land
to
our
overthrow
and
utter
destruction

therefore
we
did
pour
out
our
souls
in
prayer
to
god
that
he
would
strengthen
us
and
deliver
us
out
of
the
hands
of
our
enemies
yea
and
also
give
us
strength
that
we
might
retain
our
cities
and
our
lands
and
our
possessions
for
the
support
of
our
people

yea
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
our
god
did
visit
us
with
assurances
that
he
would
deliver
us
yea
insomuch
that
he
did
speak
peace
to
our
souls
and
did
grant
unto
us
great
faith
and
did
cause
us
that
we
should
hope
for
our
deliverance
in
him

and
we
did
take
courage
with
our
small
force
which
we
had
received
and
were
fixed
with
a
determination
to
conquer
our
enemies
and
to
maintain
our
lands
and
our
possessions
and
our
wives
and
our
children
and
the
cause
of
our
liberty

and
thus
we
did
go
forth
with
all
our
might
against
the
lamanites
who
were
in
the
city
of
manti
and
we
did
pitch
our
tents
by
the
wilderness
side
which
was
near
to
the
city

and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
that
when
the
lamanites
saw
that
we
were
in
the
borders
by
the
wilderness
which
was
near
the
city
that
they
sent
out
their
spies
round
about
us
that
they
might
discover
the
number
and
the
strength
of
our
army

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
saw
that
we
were
not
strong
according
to
our
numbers
and
fearing
that
we
should
cut
them
off
from
their
support
except
they
should
come
out
to
battle
against
us
and
kill
us
and
also
supposing
that
they
could
easily
destroy
us
with
their
numerous
hosts
therefore
they
began
to
make
preparations
to
come
out
against
us
to
battle

and
when
we
saw
that
they
were
making
preparations
to
come
out
against
us
behold
i
caused
that
gid
with
a
small
number
of
men
should
secrete
himself
in
the
wilderness
and
also
that
teomner
and
a
small
number
of
men
should
secrete
themselves
also
in
the
wilderness

now
gid
and
his
men
were
on
the
right
and
the
others
on
the
left
and
when
they
had
thus
secreted
themselves
behold
i
remained
with
the
remainder
of
my
army
in
that
same
place
where
we
had
first
pitched
our
tents
against
the
time
that
the
lamanites
should
come
out
to
battle

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
did
come
out
with
their
numerous
army
against
us
and
when
they
had
come
and
were
about
to
fall
upon
us
with
the
sword
i
caused
that
my
men
those
who
were
with
me
should
retreat
into
the
wilderness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
did
follow
after
us
with
great
speed
for
they
were
exceedingly
desirous
to
overtake
us
that
they
might
slay
us
therefore
they
did
follow
us
into
the
wilderness
and
we
did
pass
by
in
the
midst
of
gid
and
teomner
insomuch
that
they
were
not
discovered
by
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lamanites
had
passed
by
or
when
the
army
had
passed
by
gid
and
teomner
did
rise
up
from
their
secret
places
and
did
cut
off
the
spies
of
the
lamanites
that
they
should
not
return
to
the
city

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
cut
them
off
they
ran
to
the
city
and
fell
upon
the
guards
who
were
left
to
guard
the
city
insomuch
that
they
did
destroy
them
and
did
take
possession
of
the
city
alma

now
this
was
done
because
the
lamanites
did
suffer
their
whole
army
save
a
few
guards
only
to
be
led
away
into
the
wilderness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
gid
and
teomner
by
this
means
had
obtained
possession
of
their
strongholds
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
took
our
course
after
having
traveled
much
in
the
wilderness
towards
the
land
of
zarahemla

and
when
the
lamanites
saw
that
they
were
marching
towards
the
land
of
zarahemla
they
were
exceedingly
afraid
lest
there
was
a
plan
laid
to
lead
them
on
to
destruction
therefore
they
began
to
retreat
into
the
wilderness
again
yea
even
back
by
the
same
way
which
they
had
come

and
behold
it
was
night
and
they
did
pitch
their
tents
for
the
chief
captains
of
the
lamanites
had
supposed
that
the
nephites
were
weary
because
of
their
march
and
supposing
that
they
had
driven
their
whole
army
therefore
they
took
no
thought
concerning
the
city
of
manti

now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
it
was
night
i
caused
that
my
men
should
not
sleep
but
that
they
should
march
forward
by
another
way
towards
the
land
of
manti

and
because
of
this
our
march
in
the
nighttime
behold
on
the
morrow
we
were
beyond
the
lamanites
insomuch
that
we
did
arrive
before
them
at
the
city
of
manti

and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
by
this
stratagem
we
did
take
possession
of
the
city
of
manti
without
the
shedding
of
blood

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
did
arrive
near
the
city
and
saw
that
we
were
prepared
to
meet
them
they
were
astonished
exceedingly
and
struck
with
great
fear
insomuch
that
they
did
flee
into
the
wilderness

yea
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
did
flee
out
of
all
this
quarter
of
the
land
but
behold
they
have
carried
with
them
many
women
and
children
out
of
the
land

and
those
cities
which
had
been
taken
by
the
lamanites
all
of
them
are
at
this
period
of
time
in
our
possession
and
our
fathers
and
our
women
and
our
children
are
returning
to
their
homes
all
save
it
be
those
who
have
been
taken
prisoners
and
carried
off
by
the
lamanites

but
behold
our
armies
are
small
to
maintain
so
great
a
number
of
cities
and
so
great
possessions

but
behold
we
trust
in
our
god
who
has
given
us
victory
over
those
lands
insomuch
that
we
have
obtained
those
cities
and
those
lands
which
were
our
own

now
we
do
not
know
the
cause
that
the
government
does
not
grant
us
more
strength
neither
do
those
men
who
came
up
unto
us
know
why
we
have
not
received
greater
strength

behold
we
do
not
know
but
what
ye
are
unsuccessful
and
ye
have
drawn
away
the
forces
into
that
quarter
of
the
land
if
so
we
do
not
desire
to
murmur

and
if
it
is
not
so
behold
we
fear
that
there
is
some
faction
in
the
government
that
they
do
not
send
more
men
to
our
assistance
for
we
know
that
they
are
more
numerous
than
that
which
they
have
sent

but
behold
it
mattereth
notwe
trust
god
will
deliver
us
notwithstanding
the
weakness
of
our
armies
yea
and
deliver
us
out
of
the
hands
of
our
enemies

behold
this
is
the
twenty
and
ninth
year
in
the
latter
end
and
we
are
in
the
possession
of
our
lands
and
the
lamanites
have
fled
to
the
land
of
nephi

and
those
sons
of
the
people
of
ammon
of
whom
i
have
so
highly
spoken
are
with
me
in
the
city
of
manti
and
the
lord
had
supported
them
yea
and
kept
them
from
falling
by
the
sword
insomuch
that
even
one
soul
has
not
been
slain

but
behold
they
have
received
many
wounds
nevertheless
they
stand
fast
in
that
liberty
wherewith
god
has
made
them
free
and
they
are
strict
to
remember
the
lord
their
god
from
day
to
day
yea
they
do
observe
to
keep
his
statutes
and
his
judgments
and
his
commandments
continually
and
their
faith
is
strong
in
the
prophecies
concerning
that
which
is
to
come

and
now
my
beloved
brother
moroni
may
the
lord
our
god
who
has
redeemed
us
and
made
us
free
keep
you
continually
in
his
presence
yea
and
may
he
favor
this
people
even
that
ye
may
have
success
in
obtaining
the
possession
of
all
that
which
the
lamanites
have
taken
from
us
which
was
for
our
support
and
now
behold
i
close
mine
epistle
i
am
helaman
the
son
of
alma
alma
chapter


now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
thirtieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
after
moroni
had
received
and
had
read
helamans
epistle
he
was
exceedingly
rejoiced
because
of
the
welfare
yea
the
exceeding
success
which
helaman
had
had
in
obtaining
those
lands
which
were
lost

yea
and
he
did
make
it
known
unto
all
his
people
in
all
the
land
round
about
in
that
part
where
he
was
that
they
might
rejoice
also

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
immediately
sent
an
epistle
to
pahoran
desiring
that
he
should
cause
men
to
be
gathered
together
to
strengthen
helaman
or
the
armies
of
helaman
insomuch
that
he
might
with
ease
maintain
that
part
of
the
land
which
he
had
been
so
miraculously
prospered
in
regaining

and
it
came
to
pass
when
moroni
had
sent
this
epistle
to
the
land
of
zarahemla
he
began
again
to
lay
a
plan
that
he
might
obtain
the
remainder
of
those
possessions
and
cities
which
the
lamanites
had
taken
from
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
while
moroni
was
thus
making
preparations
to
go
against
the
lamanites
to
battle
behold
the
people
of
nephihah
who
were
gathered
together
from
the
city
of
moroni
and
the
city
of
lehi
and
the
city
of
morianton
were
attacked
by
the
lamanites

yea
even
those
who
had
been
compelled
to
flee
from
the
land
of
manti
and
from
the
land
round
about
had
come
over
and
joined
the
lamanites
in
this
part
of
the
land

and
thus
being
exceedingly
numerous
yea
and
receiving
strength
from
day
to
day
by
the
command
of
ammoron
they
came
forth
against
the
people
of
nephihah
and
they
did
begin
to
slay
them
with
an
exceedingly
great
slaughter

and
their
armies
were
so
numerous
that
the
remainder
of
the
people
of
nephihah
were
obliged
to
flee
before
them
and
they
came
even
and
joined
the
army
of
moroni

and
now
as
moroni
had
supposed
that
there
should
be
men
sent
to
the
city
nephihah
to
the
assistance
of
the
people
to
maintain
that
city
and
knowing
that
it
was
easier
to
keep
the
city
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
lamanites
than
to
retake
it
from
them
he
supposed
that
they
would
easily
maintain
that
city

therefore
he
retained
all
his
force
to
maintain
those
places
which
he
had
recovered

and
now
when
moroni
saw
that
the
city
of
nephihah
was
lost
he
was
exceedingly
sorrowful
and
began
to
doubt
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
people
whether
they
should
not
fall
into
the
hands
of
their
brethren

now
this
was
the
case
with
all
his
chief
captains
they
doubted
and
marveled
also
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
people
and
this
because
of
the
success
of
the
lamanites
over
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
was
angry
with
the
government
because
of
their
indifference
concerning
the
freedom
of
their
country
alma
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
wrote
again
to
the
governor
of
the
land
who
was
pahoran
and
these
are
the
words
which
he
wrote
saying
behold
i
direct
mine
epistle
to
pahoran
in
the
city
of
zarahemla
who
is
the
chief
judge
and
the
governor
over
the
land
and
also
to
all
those
who
have
been
chosen
by
this
people
to
govern
and
manage
the
affairs
of
this
war

for
behold
i
have
somewhat
to
say
unto
them
by
the
way
of
condemnation
for
behold
ye
yourselves
know
that
ye
have
been
appointed
to
gather
together
men
and
arm
them
with
swords
and
with
cimeters
and
all
manner
of
weapons
of
war
of
every
kind
and
send
forth
against
the
lamanites
in
whatsoever
parts
they
should
come
into
our
land

and
now
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
myself
and
also
my
men
and
also
helaman
and
his
men
have
suffered
exceedingly
great
sufferings
yea
even
hunger
thirst
and
fatigue
and
all
manner
of
afflictions
of
every
kind

but
behold
were
this
all
we
had
suffered
we
would
not
murmur
nor
complain

but
behold
great
has
been
the
slaughter
among
our
people
yea
thousands
have
fallen
by
the
sword
while
it
might
have
otherwise
been
if
ye
had
rendered
unto
our
armies
sufficient
strength
and
succor
for
them
yea
great
has
been
your
neglect
towards
us

and
now
behold
we
desire
to
know
the
cause
of
this
exceedingly
great
neglect
yea
we
desire
to
know
the
cause
of
your
thoughtless
state

can
you
think
to
sit
upon
your
thrones
in
a
state
of
thoughtless
stupor
while
your
enemies
are
spreading
the
work
of
death
around
you
yea
while
they
are
murdering
thousands
of
your
brethren

yea
even
they
who
have
looked
up
to
you
for
protection
yea
have
placed
you
in
a
situation
that
ye
might
have
succored
them
yea
ye
might
have
sent
armies
unto
them
to
have
strengthened
them
and
have
saved
thousands
of
them
from
falling
by
the
sword

but
behold
this
is
not
allye
have
withheld
your
provisions
from
them
insomuch
that
many
have
fought
and
bled
out
their
lives
because
of
their
great
desires
which
they
had
for
the
welfare
of
this
people
yea
and
this
they
have
done
when
they
were
about
to
perish
with
hunger
because
of
your
exceedingly
great
neglect
towards
them

and
now
my
beloved
brethrenfor
ye
ought
to
be
beloved
yea
and
ye
ought
to
have
stirred
yourselves
more
diligently
for
the
welfare
and
the
freedom
of
this
people
but
behold
ye
have
neglected
them
insomuch
that
the
blood
of
thousands
shall
come
upon
your
heads
for
vengeance
yea
for
known
unto
god
were
all
their
cries
and
all
their
sufferings

behold
could
ye
suppose
that
ye
could
sit
upon
your
thrones
and
because
of
the
exceeding
goodness
of
god
ye
could
do
nothing
and
he
would
deliver
you
behold
if
ye
have
supposed
this
ye
have
supposed
in
vain

do
ye
suppose
that
because
so
many
of
your
brethren
have
been
killed
it
is
because
of
their
wickedness
i
say
unto
you
if
ye
have
supposed
this
ye
have
supposed
in
vain
for
i
say
unto
you
there
are
many
who
have
fallen
by
the
sword
and
behold
it
is
to
your
condemnation

for
the
lord
suffereth
the
righteous
to
be
slain
that
his
justice
and
judgment
may
come
upon
the
wicked
therefore
ye
need
not
suppose
that
the
righteous
are
lost
because
they
are
slain
but
behold
they
do
enter
into
the
rest
of
the
lord
their
god

and
now
behold
i
say
unto
you
i
fear
exceedingly
that
the
judgments
of
god
will
come
upon
this
people
because
of
their
exceeding
slothfulness
yea
even
the
slothfulness
of
our
government
and
their
exceedingly
great
neglect
towards
their
brethren
yea
towards
those
who
have
been
slain

for
were
it
not
for
the
wickedness
which
first
commenced
at
our
head
we
could
have
withstood
our
enemies
that
they
could
have
gained
no
power
over
us

yea
had
it
not
been
for
the
war
which
broke
out
among
ourselves
yea
were
it
not
for
these
kingmen
who
caused
so
much
bloodshed
among
ourselves
yea
at
the
time
we
were
contending
among
ourselves
if
we
had
united
our
strength
as
we
hitherto
have
done
yea
had
it
not
been
for
the
desire
of
power
and
authority
which
those
kingmen
had
over
us
had
they
been
true
to
the
cause
of
our
freedom
and
united
with
us
and
gone
forth
against
our
enemies
instead
of
taking
up
their
swords
against
us
which
was
the
cause
of
so
much
bloodshed
among
ourselves
yea
if
we
had
gone
forth
against
them
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
we
should
have
dispersed
our
enemies
for
it
would
have
been
done
according
to
the
fulfilling
of
his
word

but
behold
now
the
lamanites
are
coming
upon
us
taking
possession
of
our
lands
and
they
are
murdering
our
people
with
the
sword
yea
our
women
and
our
children
and
also
carrying
them
away
captive
causing
them
that
they
should
suffer
all
manner
of
afflictions
and
this
because
of
the
great
wickedness
of
those
who
are
seeking
for
power
and
authority
yea
even
those
kingmen

but
why
should
i
say
much
concerning
this
matter
for
we
know
not
but
what
ye
yourselves
are
seeking
for
authority
we
know
not
but
what
ye
are
also
traitors
to
your
country

or
is
it
that
ye
have
neglected
us
because
ye
are
in
the
heart
of
our
country
and
ye
are
surrounded
by
security
that
ye
do
not
cause
food
to
be
sent
unto
us
and
also
men
to
strengthen
our
armies

have
ye
forgotten
the
commandments
of
the
lord
your
god
yea
have
ye
forgotten
the
captivity
of
our
fathers
have
ye
forgotten
the
many
times
we
have
been
delivered
out
of
the
hands
of
our
enemies

or
do
ye
suppose
that
the
lord
will
still
deliver
us
while
we
sit
upon
our
thrones
and
do
not
make
use
of
the
means
which
the
lord
has
provided
for
us

yea
will
ye
sit
in
idleness
while
ye
are
surrounded
with
thousands
of
those
yea
and
tens
of
thousands
who
do
also
sit
in
idleness
while
there
are
thousands
round
about
in
the
borders
of
the
land
who
are
falling
by
the
sword
yea
wounded
and
bleeding

do
ye
suppose
that
god
will
look
upon
you
as
guiltless
while
ye
sit
still
and
behold
these
things
behold
i
say
unto
you
nay
now
i
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
god
has
said
that
the
inward
vessel
shall
be
cleansed
first
and
then
shall
the
outer
vessel
be
cleansed
also

and
now
except
ye
do
repent
of
that
which
ye
have
done
and
begin
to
be
up
and
doing
and
send
forth
food
and
men
unto
us
and
also
unto
helaman
that
he
may
support
those
parts
of
our
country
which
he
has
regained
and
that
we
may
also
recover
the
remainder
of
our
possessions
in
these
parts
behold
it
will
be
expedient
that
we
contend
no
more
with
the
lamanites
until
we
have
first
cleansed
our
inward
vessel
yea
even
the
great
head
of
our
government

and
except
ye
grant
mine
epistle
and
come
out
and
show
unto
me
a
true
spirit
of
freedom
and
strive
to
strengthen
and
fortify
our
armies
and
grant
unto
them
food
for
their
support
behold
i
will
leave
a
part
of
my
freemen
to
maintain
this
part
of
our
land
and
i
will
leave
the
strength
and
the
blessings
of
god
upon
them
that
none
other
power
can
operate
against
them

and
this
because
of
their
exceeding
faith
and
their
patience
in
their
tribulations

and
i
will
come
unto
you
and
if
there
be
any
among
you
that
has
a
desire
for
freedom
yea
if
there
be
even
a
spark
of
freedom
remaining
behold
i
will
stir
up
insurrections
among
you
even
until
those
who
have
desires
to
usurp
power
and
authority
shall
become
extinct

yea
behold
i
do
not
fear
your
power
nor
your
authority
but
it
is
my
god
whom
i
fear
and
it
is
according
to
his
commandments
that
i
do
take
my
sword
to
defend
the
cause
of
my
country
and
it
is
because
of
your
iniquity
that
we
have
suffered
so
much
loss

behold
it
is
time
yea
the
time
is
now
at
hand
that
except
ye
do
bestir
yourselves
in
the
defence
of
your
country
and
your
little
ones
the
sword
of
justice
doth
hang
over
you
yea
and
it
shall
fall
upon
you
and
visit
you
even
to
your
utter
destruction

behold
i
wait
for
assistance
from
you
and
except
ye
do
administer
unto
our
relief
behold
i
come
unto
you
even
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
smite
you
with
the
sword
insomuch
that
ye
can
have
no
more
power
to
impede
the
progress
of
this
people
in
the
cause
of
our
freedom

for
behold
the
lord
will
not
suffer
that
ye
shall
live
and
wax
strong
in
your
iniquities
to
destroy
his
righteous
people

behold
can
you
suppose
that
the
lord
will
spare
you
and
come
out
in
judgment
against
the
lamanites
when
it
is
the
tradition
of
their
fathers
that
has
caused
their
hatred
yea
and
it
has
been
redoubled
by
those
who
have
dissented
from
us
while
your
iniquity
is
for
the
cause
of
your
love
of
glory
and
the
vain
things
of
the
world

ye
know
that
ye
do
transgress
the
laws
of
god
and
ye
do
know
that
ye
do
trample
them
under
your
feet
behold
the
lord
saith
unto
me
if
those
whom
ye
have
appointed
your
governors
do
not
repent
of
their
sins
and
iniquities
ye
shall
go
up
to
battle
against
them

and
now
behold
i
moroni
am
constrained
according
to
the
covenant
which
i
have
made
to
keep
the
commandments
of
my
god
therefore
i
would
that
ye
should
adhere
to
the
word
of
god
and
send
speedily
unto
me
of
your
provisions
and
of
your
men
and
also
to
helaman

and
behold
if
ye
will
not
do
this
i
come
unto
you
speedily
for
behold
god
will
not
suffer
that
we
should
perish
with
hunger
therefore
he
will
give
unto
us
of
your
food
even
if
it
must
be
by
the
sword
now
see
that
ye
fulfil
the
word
of
god

behold
i
am
moroni
your
chief
captain
i
seek
not
for
power
but
to
pull
it
down
i
seek
not
for
honor
of
the
world
but
for
the
glory
of
my
god
and
the
freedom
and
welfare
of
my
country
and
thus
i
close
mine
epistle
alma
chapter


behold
now
it
came
to
pass
that
soon
after
moroni
had
sent
his
epistle
unto
the
chief
governor
he
received
an
epistle
from
pahoran
the
chief
governor
and
these
are
the
words
which
he
received

i
pahoran
who
am
the
chief
governor
of
this
land
do
send
these
words
unto
moroni
the
chief
captain
over
the
army
behold
i
say
unto
you
moroni
that
i
do
not
joy
in
your
great
afflictions
yea
it
grieves
my
soul

but
behold
there
are
those
who
do
joy
in
your
afflictions
yea
insomuch
that
they
have
risen
up
in
rebellion
against
me
and
also
those
of
my
people
who
are
freemen
yea
and
those
who
have
risen
up
are
exceedingly
numerous

and
it
is
those
who
have
sought
to
take
away
the
judgmentseat
from
me
that
have
been
the
cause
of
this
great
iniquity
for
they
have
used
great
flattery
and
they
have
led
away
the
hearts
of
many
people
which
will
be
the
cause
of
sore
affliction
among
us
they
have
withheld
our
provisions
and
have
daunted
our
freemen
that
they
have
not
come
unto
you

and
behold
they
have
driven
me
out
before
them
and
i
have
fled
to
the
land
of
gideon
with
as
many
men
as
it
were
possible
that
i
could
get

and
behold
i
have
sent
a
proclamation
throughout
this
part
of
the
land
and
behold
they
are
flocking
to
us
daily
to
their
arms
in
the
defence
of
their
country
and
their
freedom
and
to
avenge
our
wrongs

and
they
have
come
unto
us
insomuch
that
those
who
have
risen
up
in
rebellion
against
us
are
set
at
defiance
yea
insomuch
that
they
do
fear
us
and
durst
not
come
out
against
us
to
battle

they
have
got
possession
of
the
land
or
the
city
of
zarahemla
they
have
appointed
a
king
over
them
and
he
hath
written
unto
the
king
of
the
lamanites
in
the
which
he
hath
joined
an
alliance
with
him
in
the
which
alliance
he
hath
agreed
to
maintain
the
city
of
zarahemla
which
maintenance
he
supposeth
will
enable
the
lamanites
to
conquer
the
remainder
of
the
land
and
he
shall
be
placed
king
over
this
people
when
they
shall
be
conquered
under
the
lamanites

and
now
in
your
epistle
you
have
censured
me
but
it
mattereth
not
i
am
not
angry
but
do
rejoice
in
the
greatness
of
your
heart
i
pahoran
do
not
seek
for
power
save
only
to
retain
my
judgmentseat
that
i
may
preserve
the
rights
and
the
liberty
of
my
people
my
soul
standeth
fast
in
that
liberty
in
the
which
god
hath
made
us
free

and
now
behold
we
will
resist
wickedness
even
unto
bloodshed
we
would
not
shed
the
blood
of
the
lamanites
if
they
would
stay
in
their
own
land

we
would
not
shed
the
blood
of
our
brethren
if
they
would
not
rise
up
in
rebellion
and
take
the
sword
against
us

we
would
subject
ourselves
to
the
yoke
of
bondage
if
it
were
requisite
with
the
justice
of
god
or
if
he
should
command
us
so
to
do

but
behold
he
doth
not
command
us
that
we
shall
subject
ourselves
to
our
enemies
but
that
we
should
put
our
trust
in
him
and
he
will
deliver
us

therefore
my
beloved
brother
moroni
let
us
resist
evil
and
whatsoever
evil
we
cannot
resist
with
our
words
yea
such
as
rebellions
and
dissensions
let
us
resist
them
with
our
swords
that
we
may
retain
our
freedom
that
we
may
rejoice
in
the
great
privilege
of
our
church
and
in
the
cause
of
our
redeemer
and
our
god

therefore
come
unto
me
speedily
with
a
few
of
your
men
and
leave
the
remainder
in
the
charge
of
lehi
and
teancum
give
unto
them
power
to
conduct
the
war
in
that
part
of
the
land
according
to
the
spirit
of
god
which
is
also
the
spirit
of
freedom
which
is
in
them

behold
i
have
sent
a
few
provisions
unto
them
that
they
may
not
perish
until
ye
can
come
unto
me

gather
together
whatsoever
force
ye
can
upon
your
march
hither
and
we
will
go
speedily
against
those
dissenters
in
the
strength
of
our
god
according
to
the
faith
which
is
in
us

and
we
will
take
possession
of
the
city
of
zarahemla
that
we
may
obtain
more
food
to
send
forth
unto
lehi
and
teancum
yea
we
will
go
forth
against
them
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
and
we
will
put
an
end
to
this
great
iniquity

and
now
moroni
i
do
joy
in
receiving
your
epistle
for
i
was
somewhat
worried
concerning
what
we
should
do
whether
it
should
be
just
in
us
to
go
against
our
brethren

but
ye
have
said
except
they
repent
the
lord
hath
commanded
you
that
ye
should
go
against
them

see
that
ye
strengthen
lehi
and
teancum
in
the
lord
tell
them
to
fear
not
for
god
will
deliver
them
yea
and
also
all
those
who
stand
fast
in
that
liberty
wherewith
god
hath
made
them
free
and
now
i
close
mine
epistle
to
my
beloved
brother
moroni
alma
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
moroni
had
received
this
epistle
his
heart
did
take
courage
and
was
filled
with
exceedingly
great
joy
because
of
the
faithfulness
of
pahoran
that
he
was
not
also
a
traitor
to
the
freedom
and
cause
of
his
country

but
he
did
also
mourn
exceedingly
because
of
the
iniquity
of
those
who
had
driven
pahoran
from
the
judgmentseat
yea
in
fine
because
of
those
who
had
rebelled
against
their
country
and
also
their
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
took
a
small
number
of
men
according
to
the
desire
of
pahoran
and
gave
lehi
and
teancum
command
over
the
remainder
of
his
army
and
took
his
march
towards
the
land
of
gideon

and
he
did
raise
the
standard
of
liberty
in
whatsoever
place
he
did
enter
and
gained
whatsoever
force
he
could
in
all
his
march
towards
the
land
of
gideon

and
it
came
to
pass
that
thousands
did
flock
unto
his
standard
and
did
take
up
their
swords
in
the
defence
of
their
freedom
that
they
might
not
come
into
bondage

and
thus
when
moroni
had
gathered
together
whatsoever
men
he
could
in
all
his
march
he
came
to
the
land
of
gideon
and
uniting
his
forces
with
those
of
pahoran
they
became
exceedingly
strong
even
stronger
than
the
men
of
pachus
who
was
the
king
of
those
dissenters
who
had
driven
the
freemen
out
of
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
had
taken
possession
of
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
and
pahoran
went
down
with
their
armies
into
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
went
forth
against
the
city
and
did
meet
the
men
of
pachus
insomuch
that
they
did
come
to
battle

and
behold
pachus
was
slain
and
his
men
were
taken
prisoners
and
pahoran
was
restored
to
his
judgmentseat

and
the
men
of
pachus
received
their
trial
according
to
the
law
and
also
those
kingmen
who
had
been
taken
and
cast
into
prison
and
they
were
executed
according
to
the
law
yea
those
men
of
pachus
and
those
kingmen
whosoever
would
not
take
up
arms
in
the
defence
of
their
country
but
would
fight
against
it
were
put
to
death

and
thus
it
became
expedient
that
this
law
should
be
strictly
observed
for
the
safety
of
their
country
yea
and
whosoever
was
found
denying
their
freedom
was
speedily
executed
according
to
the
law

and
thus
ended
the
thirtieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
moroni
and
pahoran
having
restored
peace
to
the
land
of
zarahemla
among
their
own
people
having
inflicted
death
upon
all
those
who
were
not
true
to
the
cause
of
freedom

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
thirty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
moroni
immediately
caused
that
provisions
should
be
sent
and
also
an
army
of
six
thousand
men
should
be
sent
unto
helaman
to
assist
him
in
preserving
that
part
of
the
land

and
he
also
caused
that
an
army
of
six
thousand
men
with
a
sufficient
quantity
of
food
should
be
sent
to
the
armies
of
lehi
and
teancum
and
it
came
to
pass
that
this
was
done
to
fortify
the
land
against
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
and
pahoran
leaving
a
large
body
of
men
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
took
their
march
with
a
large
body
of
men
towards
the
land
of
nephihah
being
determined
to
overthrow
the
lamanites
in
that
city

and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
they
were
marching
towards
the
land
they
took
a
large
body
of
men
of
the
lamanites
and
slew
many
of
them
and
took
their
provisions
and
their
weapons
of
war

and
it
came
to
pass
after
they
had
taken
them
they
caused
them
to
enter
into
a
covenant
that
they
would
no
more
take
up
their
weapons
of
war
against
the
nephites

and
when
they
had
entered
into
this
covenant
they
sent
them
to
dwell
with
the
people
of
ammon
and
they
were
in
number
about
four
thousand
who
had
not
been
slain

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
sent
them
away
they
pursued
their
march
towards
the
land
of
nephihah
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
come
to
the
city
of
nephihah
they
did
pitch
their
tents
in
the
plains
of
nephihah
which
is
near
the
city
of
nephihah

now
moroni
was
desirous
that
the
lamanites
should
come
out
to
battle
against
them
upon
the
plains
but
the
lamanites
knowing
of
their
exceedingly
great
courage
and
beholding
the
greatness
of
their
numbers
therefore
they
durst
not
come
out
against
them
therefore
they
did
not
come
to
battle
in
that
day

and
when
the
night
came
moroni
went
forth
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
came
upon
the
top
of
the
wall
to
spy
out
in
what
part
of
the
city
the
lamanites
did
camp
with
their
army

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
on
the
east
by
the
entrance
and
they
were
all
asleep
and
now
moroni
returned
to
his
army
and
caused
that
they
should
prepare
in
haste
strong
cords
and
ladders
to
be
let
down
from
the
top
of
the
wall
into
the
inner
part
of
the
wall

and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
caused
that
his
men
should
march
forth
and
come
upon
the
top
of
the
wall
and
let
themselves
down
into
that
part
of
the
city
yea
even
on
the
west
where
the
lamanites
did
not
camp
with
their
armies

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
all
let
down
into
the
city
by
night
by
the
means
of
their
strong
cords
and
their
ladders
thus
when
the
morning
came
they
were
all
within
the
walls
of
the
city

and
now
when
the
lamanites
awoke
and
saw
that
the
armies
of
moroni
were
within
the
walls
they
were
affrighted
exceedingly
insomuch
that
they
did
flee
out
by
the
pass

and
now
when
moroni
saw
that
they
were
fleeing
before
him
he
did
cause
that
his
men
should
march
forth
against
them
and
slew
many
and
surrounded
many
others
and
took
them
prisoners
and
the
remainder
of
them
fled
into
the
land
of
moroni
which
was
in
the
borders
by
the
seashore

thus
had
moroni
and
pahoran
obtained
the
possession
of
the
city
of
nephihah
without
the
loss
of
one
soul
and
there
were
many
of
the
lamanites
who
were
slain

now
it
came
to
pass
that
many
of
the
lamanites
that
were
prisoners
were
desirous
to
join
the
people
of
ammon
and
become
a
free
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
many
as
were
desirous
unto
them
it
was
granted
according
to
their
desires

therefore
all
the
prisoners
of
the
lamanites
did
join
the
people
of
ammon
and
did
begin
to
labor
exceedingly
tilling
the
ground
raising
all
manner
of
grain
and
flocks
and
herds
of
every
kind
and
thus
were
the
nephites
relieved
from
a
great
burden
yea
insomuch
that
they
were
relieved
from
all
the
prisoners
of
the
lamanites

now
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
after
he
had
obtained
possession
of
the
city
of
nephihah
having
taken
many
prisoners
which
did
reduce
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
exceedingly
and
having
regained
many
of
the
nephites
who
had
been
taken
prisoners
which
did
strengthen
the
army
of
moroni
exceedingly
therefore
moroni
went
forth
from
the
land
of
nephihah
to
the
land
of
lehi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lamanites
saw
that
moroni
was
coming
against
them
they
were
again
frightened
and
fled
before
the
army
of
moroni

and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
and
his
army
did
pursue
them
from
city
to
city
until
they
were
met
by
lehi
and
teancum
and
the
lamanites
fled
from
lehi
and
teancum
even
down
upon
the
borders
by
the
seashore
until
they
came
to
the
land
of
moroni

and
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
were
all
gathered
together
insomuch
that
they
were
all
in
one
body
in
the
land
of
moroni
now
ammoron
the
king
of
the
lamanites
was
also
with
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
and
lehi
and
teancum
did
encamp
with
their
armies
round
about
in
the
borders
of
the
land
of
moroni
insomuch
that
the
lamanites
were
encircled
about
in
the
borders
by
the
wilderness
on
the
south
and
in
the
borders
by
the
wilderness
on
the
east

and
thus
they
did
encamp
for
the
night
for
behold
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites
also
were
weary
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
march
therefore
they
did
not
resolve
upon
any
stratagem
in
the
nighttime
save
it
were
teancum
for
he
was
exceedingly
angry
with
ammoron
insomuch
that
he
considered
that
ammoron
and
amalickiah
his
brother
had
been
the
cause
of
this
great
and
lasting
war
between
them
and
the
lamanites
which
had
been
the
cause
of
so
much
war
and
bloodshed
yea
and
so
much
famine

and
it
came
to
pass
that
teancum
in
his
anger
did
go
forth
into
the
camp
of
the
lamanites
and
did
let
himself
down
over
the
walls
of
the
city
and
he
went
forth
with
a
cord
from
place
to
place
insomuch
that
he
did
find
the
king
and
he
did
cast
a
javelin
at
him
which
did
pierce
him
near
the
heart
but
behold
the
king
did
awaken
his
servants
before
he
died
insomuch
that
they
did
pursue
teancum
and
slew
him

now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
lehi
and
moroni
knew
that
teancum
was
dead
they
were
exceedingly
sorrowful
for
behold
he
had
been
a
man
who
had
fought
valiantly
for
his
country
yea
a
true
friend
to
liberty
and
he
had
suffered
very
many
exceedingly
sore
afflictions
but
behold
he
was
dead
and
had
gone
the
way
of
all
the
earth

now
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
marched
forth
on
the
morrow
and
came
upon
the
lamanites
insomuch
that
they
did
slay
them
with
a
great
slaughter
and
they
did
drive
them
out
of
the
land
and
they
did
flee
even
that
they
did
not
return
at
that
time
against
the
nephites

and
thus
ended
the
thirty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
and
thus
they
had
had
wars
and
bloodsheds
and
famine
and
affliction
for
the
space
of
many
years

and
there
had
been
murders
and
contentions
and
dissensions
and
all
manner
of
iniquity
among
the
people
of
nephi
nevertheless
for
the
righteous
sake
yea
because
of
the
prayers
of
the
righteous
they
were
spared

but
behold
because
of
the
exceedingly
great
length
of
the
war
between
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites
many
had
become
hardened
because
of
the
exceedingly
great
length
of
the
war
and
many
were
softened
because
of
their
afflictions
insomuch
that
they
did
humble
themselves
before
god
even
in
the
depth
of
humility

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
moroni
had
fortified
those
parts
of
the
land
which
were
most
exposed
to
the
lamanites
until
they
were
sufficiently
strong
he
returned
to
the
city
of
zarahemla
and
also
helaman
returned
to
the
place
of
his
inheritance
and
there
was
once
more
peace
established
among
the
people
of
nephi

and
moroni
yielded
up
the
command
of
his
armies
into
the
hands
of
his
son
whose
name
was
moronihah
and
he
retired
to
his
own
house
that
he
might
spend
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
peace

and
pahoran
did
return
to
his
judgmentseat
and
helaman
did
take
upon
him
again
to
preach
unto
the
people
the
word
of
god
for
because
of
so
many
wars
and
contentions
it
had
become
expedient
that
a
regulation
should
be
made
again
in
the
church

therefore
helaman
and
his
brethren
went
forth
and
did
declare
the
word
of
god
with
much
power
unto
the
convincing
of
many
people
of
their
wickedness
which
did
cause
them
to
repent
of
their
sins
and
to
be
baptized
unto
the
lord
their
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
establish
again
the
church
of
god
throughout
all
the
land

yea
and
regulations
were
made
concerning
the
law
and
their
judges
and
their
chief
judges
were
chosen

and
the
people
of
nephi
began
to
prosper
again
in
the
land
and
began
to
multiply
and
to
wax
exceedingly
strong
again
in
the
land
and
they
began
to
grow
exceedingly
rich

but
notwithstanding
their
riches
or
their
strength
or
their
prosperity
they
were
not
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
eyes
neither
were
they
slow
to
remember
the
lord
their
god
but
they
did
humble
themselves
exceedingly
before
him

yea
they
did
remember
how
great
things
the
lord
had
done
for
them
that
he
had
delivered
them
from
death
and
from
bonds
and
from
prisons
and
from
all
manner
of
afflictions
and
he
had
delivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies

and
they
did
pray
unto
the
lord
their
god
continually
insomuch
that
the
lord
did
bless
them
according
to
his
word
so
that
they
did
wax
strong
and
prosper
in
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
all
these
things
were
done
and
helaman
died
in
the
thirty
and
fifth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
alma
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
thirty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
that
shiblon
took
possession
of
those
sacred
things
which
had
been
delivered
unto
helaman
by
alma

and
he
was
a
just
man
and
he
did
walk
uprightly
before
god
and
he
did
observe
to
do
good
continually
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
his
god
and
also
did
his
brother

and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
died
also
and
thus
ended
the
thirty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
thirty
and
seventh
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
there
was
a
large
company
of
men
even
to
the
amount
of
five
thousand
and
four
hundred
men
with
their
wives
and
their
children
departed
out
of
the
land
of
zarahemla
into
the
land
which
was
northward

and
it
came
to
pass
that
hagoth
he
being
an
exceedingly
curious
man
therefore
he
went
forth
and
built
him
an
exceedingly
large
ship
on
the
borders
of
the
land
bountiful
by
the
land
desolation
and
launched
it
forth
into
the
west
sea
by
the
narrow
neck
which
led
into
the
land
northward

and
behold
there
were
many
of
the
nephites
who
did
enter
therein
and
did
sail
forth
with
much
provisions
and
also
many
women
and
children
and
they
took
their
course
northward
and
thus
ended
the
thirty
and
seventh
year

and
in
the
thirty
and
eighth
year
this
man
built
other
ships
and
the
first
ship
did
also
return
and
many
more
people
did
enter
into
it
and
they
also
took
much
provisions
and
set
out
again
to
the
land
northward

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
never
heard
of
more
and
we
suppose
that
they
were
drowned
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
it
came
to
pass
that
one
other
ship
also
did
sail
forth
and
whither
she
did
go
we
know
not

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
year
there
were
many
people
who
went
forth
into
the
land
northward
and
thus
ended
the
thirty
and
eighth
year

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
thirty
and
ninth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
shiblon
died
also
and
corianton
had
gone
forth
to
the
land
northward
in
a
ship
to
carry
forth
provisions
unto
the
people
who
had
gone
forth
into
that
land

therefore
it
became
expedient
for
shiblon
to
confer
those
sacred
things
before
his
death
upon
the
son
of
helaman
who
was
called
helaman
being
called
after
the
name
of
his
father

now
behold
all
those
engravings
which
were
in
the
possession
of
helaman
were
written
and
sent
forth
among
the
children
of
men
throughout
all
the
land
save
it
were
those
parts
which
had
been
commanded
by
alma
should
not
go
forth

nevertheless
these
things
were
to
be
kept
sacred
and
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
another
therefore
in
this
year
they
had
been
conferred
upon
helaman
before
the
death
of
shiblon

and
it
came
to
pass
also
in
this
year
that
there
were
some
dissenters
who
had
gone
forth
unto
the
lamanites
and
they
were
stirred
up
again
to
anger
against
the
nephites

and
also
in
this
same
year
they
came
down
with
a
numerous
army
to
war
against
the
people
of
moronihah
or
against
the
army
of
moronihah
in
the
which
they
were
beaten
and
driven
back
again
to
their
own
lands
suffering
great
loss

and
thus
ended
the
thirty
and
ninth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi

and
thus
ended
the
account
of
alma
and
helaman
his
son
and
also
shiblon
who
was
his
son
the
book
of
helaman
an
account
of
the
nephites
their
wars
and
contentions
and
their
dissensions
and
also
the
prophecies
of
many
holy
prophets
before
the
coming
of
christ
according
to
the
records
of
helaman
who
was
the
son
of
helaman
and
also
according
to
the
records
of
his
sons
even
down
to
the
coming
of
christ
and
also
many
of
the
lamanites
are
converted
an
account
of
their
conversion
an
account
of
the
righteousness
of
the
lamanites
and
the
wickedness
and
abominations
of
the
nephites
according
to
the
record
of
helaman
and
his
sons
even
down
to
the
coming
of
christ
which
is
called
the
book
of
helaman
helaman
chapter


and
now
behold
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
fortieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
there
began
to
be
a
serious
difficulty
among
the
people
of
the
nephites

for
behold
pahoran
had
died
and
gone
the
way
of
all
the
earth
therefore
there
began
to
be
a
serious
contention
concerning
who
should
have
the
judgmentseat
among
the
brethren
who
were
the
sons
of
pahoran

now
these
are
their
names
who
did
contend
for
the
judgmentseat
who
did
also
cause
the
people
to
contend
pahoran
paanchi
and
pacumeni

now
these
are
not
all
the
sons
of
pahoran
for
he
had
many
but
these
are
they
who
did
contend
for
the
judgmentseat
therefore
they
did
cause
three
divisions
among
the
people

nevertheless
it
came
to
pass
that
pahoran
was
appointed
by
the
voice
of
the
people
to
be
chief
judge
and
a
governor
over
the
people
of
nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
pacumeni
when
he
saw
that
he
could
not
obtain
the
judgmentseat
he
did
unite
with
the
voice
of
the
people

but
behold
paanchi
and
that
part
of
the
people
that
were
desirous
that
he
should
be
their
governor
was
exceedingly
wroth
therefore
he
was
about
to
flatter
away
those
people
to
rise
up
in
rebellion
against
their
brethren

and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
about
to
do
this
behold
he
was
taken
and
was
tried
according
to
the
voice
of
the
people
and
condemned
unto
death
for
he
had
raised
up
in
rebellion
and
sought
to
destroy
the
liberty
of
the
people

now
when
those
people
who
were
desirous
that
he
should
be
their
governor
saw
that
he
was
condemned
unto
death
therefore
they
were
angry
and
behold
they
sent
forth
one
kishkumen
even
to
the
judgmentseat
of
pahoran
and
murdered
pahoran
as
he
sat
upon
the
judgmentseat

and
he
was
pursued
by
the
servants
of
pahoran
but
behold
so
speedy
was
the
flight
of
kishkumen
that
no
man
could
overtake
him

and
he
went
unto
those
that
sent
him
and
they
all
entered
into
a
covenant
yea
swearing
by
their
everlasting
maker
that
they
would
tell
no
man
that
kishkumen
had
murdered
pahoran

therefore
kishkumen
was
not
known
among
the
people
of
nephi
for
he
was
in
disguise
at
the
time
that
he
murdered
pahoran
and
kishkumen
and
his
band
who
had
covenanted
with
him
did
mingle
themselves
among
the
people
in
a
manner
that
they
all
could
not
be
found
but
as
many
as
were
found
were
condemned
unto
death

and
now
behold
pacumeni
was
appointed
according
to
the
voice
of
the
people
to
be
a
chief
judge
and
a
governor
over
the
people
to
reign
in
the
stead
of
his
brother
pahoran
and
it
was
according
to
his
right
and
all
this
was
done
in
the
fortieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
and
it
had
an
end

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
forty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
that
the
lamanites
had
gathered
together
an
innumerable
army
of
men
and
armed
them
with
swords
and
with
cimeters
and
with
bows
and
with
arrows
and
with
headplates
and
with
breastplates
and
with
all
manner
of
shields
of
every
kind

and
they
came
down
again
that
they
might
pitch
battle
against
the
nephites
and
they
were
led
by
a
man
whose
name
was
coriantumr
and
he
was
a
descendant
of
zarahemla
and
he
was
a
dissenter
from
among
the
nephites
and
he
was
a
large
and
a
mighty
man

therefore
the
king
of
the
lamanites
whose
name
was
tubaloth
who
was
the
son
of
ammoron
supposing
that
coriantumr
being
a
mighty
man
could
stand
against
the
nephites
with
his
strength
and
also
with
his
great
wisdom
insomuch
that
by
sending
him
forth
he
should
gain
power
over
the
nephites

therefore
he
did
stir
them
up
to
anger
and
he
did
gather
together
his
armies
and
he
did
appoint
coriantumr
to
be
their
leader
and
did
cause
that
they
should
march
down
to
the
land
of
zarahemla
to
battle
against
the
nephites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
because
of
so
much
contention
and
so
much
difficulty
in
the
government
that
they
had
not
kept
sufficient
guards
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
for
they
had
supposed
that
the
lamanites
durst
not
come
into
the
heart
of
their
lands
to
attack
that
great
city
zarahemla

but
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantumr
did
march
forth
at
the
head
of
his
numerous
host
and
came
upon
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
and
their
march
was
with
such
exceedingly
great
speed
that
there
was
no
time
for
the
nephites
to
gather
together
their
armies

therefore
coriantumr
did
cut
down
the
watch
by
the
entrance
of
the
city
and
did
march
forth
with
his
whole
army
into
the
city
and
they
did
slay
every
one
who
did
oppose
them
insomuch
that
they
did
take
possession
of
the
whole
city

and
it
came
to
pass
that
pacumeni
who
was
the
chief
judge
did
flee
before
coriantumr
even
to
the
walls
of
the
city
and
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantumr
did
smite
him
against
the
wall
insomuch
that
he
died
and
thus
ended
the
days
of
pacumeni

and
now
when
coriantumr
saw
that
he
was
in
possession
of
the
city
of
zarahemla
and
saw
that
the
nephites
had
fled
before
them
and
were
slain
and
were
taken
and
were
cast
into
prison
and
that
he
had
obtained
the
possession
of
the
strongest
hold
in
all
the
land
his
heart
took
courage
insomuch
that
he
was
about
to
go
forth
against
all
the
land

and
now
he
did
not
tarry
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
but
he
did
march
forth
with
a
large
army
even
towards
the
city
of
bountiful
for
it
was
his
determination
to
go
forth
and
cut
his
way
through
with
the
sword
that
he
might
obtain
the
north
parts
of
the
land

and
supposing
that
their
greatest
strength
was
in
the
center
of
the
land
therefore
he
did
march
forth
giving
them
no
time
to
assemble
themselves
together
save
it
were
in
small
bodies
and
in
this
manner
they
did
fall
upon
them
and
cut
them
down
to
the
earth

but
behold
this
march
of
coriantumr
through
the
center
of
the
land
gave
moronihah
great
advantage
over
them
notwithstanding
the
greatness
of
the
number
of
the
nephites
who
were
slain

for
behold
moronihah
had
supposed
that
the
lamanites
durst
not
come
into
the
center
of
the
land
but
that
they
would
attack
the
cities
round
about
in
the
borders
as
they
had
hitherto
done
therefore
moronihah
had
caused
that
their
strong
armies
should
maintain
those
parts
round
about
by
the
borders

but
behold
the
lamanites
were
not
frightened
according
to
his
desire
but
they
had
come
into
the
center
of
the
land
and
had
taken
the
capital
city
which
was
the
city
of
zarahemla
and
were
marching
through
the
most
capital
parts
of
the
land
slaying
the
people
with
a
great
slaughter
both
men
women
and
children
taking
possession
of
many
cities
and
of
many
strongholds

but
when
moronihah
had
discovered
this
he
immediately
sent
forth
lehi
with
an
army
round
about
to
head
them
before
they
should
come
to
the
land
bountiful

and
thus
he
did
and
he
did
head
them
before
they
came
to
the
land
bountiful
and
gave
unto
them
battle
insomuch
that
they
began
to
retreat
back
towards
the
land
of
zarahemla

and
it
came
to
pass
that
moronihah
did
head
them
in
their
retreat
and
did
give
unto
them
battle
insomuch
that
it
became
an
exceedingly
bloody
battle
yea
many
were
slain
and
among
the
number
who
were
slain
coriantumr
was
also
found

and
now
behold
the
lamanites
could
not
retreat
either
way
neither
on
the
north
nor
on
the
south
nor
on
the
east
nor
on
the
west
for
they
were
surrounded
on
every
hand
by
the
nephites

and
thus
had
coriantumr
plunged
the
lamanites
into
the
midst
of
the
nephites
insomuch
that
they
were
in
the
power
of
the
nephites
and
he
himself
was
slain
and
the
lamanites
did
yield
themselves
into
the
hands
of
the
nephites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
moronihah
took
possession
of
the
city
of
zarahemla
again
and
caused
that
the
lamanites
who
had
been
taken
prisoners
should
depart
out
of
the
land
in
peace

and
thus
ended
the
forty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
helaman
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
forty
and
second
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
after
moronihah
had
established
again
peace
between
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites
behold
there
was
no
one
to
fill
the
judgmentseat
therefore
there
began
to
be
a
contention
again
among
the
people
concerning
who
should
fill
the
judgmentseat

and
it
came
to
pass
that
helaman
who
was
the
son
of
helaman
was
appointed
to
fill
the
judgmentseat
by
the
voice
of
the
people

but
behold
kishkumen
who
had
murdered
pahoran
did
lay
wait
to
destroy
helaman
also
and
he
was
upheld
by
his
band
who
had
entered
into
a
covenant
that
no
one
should
know
his
wickedness

for
there
was
one
gadianton
who
was
exceedingly
expert
in
many
words
and
also
in
his
craft
to
carry
on
the
secret
work
of
murder
and
of
robbery
therefore
he
became
the
leader
of
the
band
of
kishkumen

therefore
he
did
flatter
them
and
also
kishkumen
that
if
they
would
place
him
in
the
judgmentseat
he
would
grant
unto
those
who
belonged
to
his
band
that
they
should
be
placed
in
power
and
authority
among
the
people
therefore
kishkumen
sought
to
destroy
helaman

and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
went
forth
towards
the
judgmentseat
to
destroy
helaman
behold
one
of
the
servants
of
helaman
having
been
out
by
night
and
having
obtained
through
disguise
a
knowledge
of
those
plans
which
had
been
laid
by
this
band
to
destroy
helaman

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
met
kishkumen
and
he
gave
unto
him
a
sign
therefore
kishkumen
made
known
unto
him
the
object
of
his
desire
desiring
that
he
would
conduct
him
to
the
judgmentseat
that
he
might
murder
helaman

and
when
the
servant
of
helaman
had
known
all
the
heart
of
kishkumen
and
how
that
it
was
his
object
to
murder
and
also
that
it
was
the
object
of
all
those
who
belonged
to
his
band
to
murder
and
to
rob
and
to
gain
power
and
this
was
their
secret
plan
and
their
combination
the
servant
of
helaman
said
unto
kishkumen
let
us
go
forth
unto
the
judgmentseat

now
this
did
please
kishkumen
exceedingly
for
he
did
suppose
that
he
should
accomplish
his
design
but
behold
the
servant
of
helaman
as
they
were
going
forth
unto
the
judgmentseat
did
stab
kishkumen
even
to
the
heart
that
he
fell
dead
without
a
groan
and
he
ran
and
told
helaman
all
the
things
which
he
had
seen
and
heard
and
done

and
it
came
to
pass
that
helaman
did
send
forth
to
take
this
band
of
robbers
and
secret
murderers
that
they
might
be
executed
according
to
the
law

but
behold
when
gadianton
had
found
that
kishkumen
did
not
return
he
feared
lest
that
he
should
be
destroyed
therefore
he
caused
that
his
band
should
follow
him
and
they
took
their
flight
out
of
the
land
by
a
secret
way
into
the
wilderness
and
thus
when
helaman
sent
forth
to
take
them
they
could
nowhere
be
found

and
more
of
this
gadianton
shall
be
spoken
hereafter
and
thus
ended
the
forty
and
second
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi

and
behold
in
the
end
of
this
book
ye
shall
see
that
this
gadianton
did
prove
the
overthrow
yea
almost
the
entire
destruction
of
the
people
of
nephi

behold
i
do
not
mean
the
end
of
the
book
of
helaman
but
i
mean
the
end
of
the
book
of
nephi
from
which
i
have
taken
all
the
account
which
i
have
written
helaman
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
forty
and
third
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
there
was
no
contention
among
the
people
of
nephi
save
it
were
a
little
pride
which
was
in
the
church
which
did
cause
some
little
dissensions
among
the
people
which
affairs
were
settled
in
the
ending
of
the
forty
and
third
year

and
there
was
no
contention
among
the
people
in
the
forty
and
fourth
year
neither
was
there
much
contention
in
the
forty
and
fifth
year

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
forty
and
sixth
yea
there
was
much
contention
and
many
dissensions
in
the
which
there
were
an
exceedingly
great
many
who
departed
out
of
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
went
forth
unto
the
land
northward
to
inherit
the
land

and
they
did
travel
to
an
exceedingly
great
distance
insomuch
that
they
came
to
large
bodies
of
water
and
many
rivers

yea
and
even
they
did
spread
forth
into
all
parts
of
the
land
into
whatever
parts
it
had
not
been
rendered
desolate
and
without
timber
because
of
the
many
inhabitants
who
had
before
inherited
the
land

and
now
no
part
of
the
land
was
desolate
save
it
were
for
timber
but
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
destruction
of
the
people
who
had
before
inhabited
the
land
it
was
called
desolate

and
there
being
but
little
timber
upon
the
face
of
the
land
nevertheless
the
people
who
went
forth
became
exceedingly
expert
in
the
working
of
cement
therefore
they
did
build
houses
of
cement
in
the
which
they
did
dwell

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
multiply
and
spread
and
did
go
forth
from
the
land
southward
to
the
land
northward
and
did
spread
insomuch
that
they
began
to
cover
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
from
the
sea
south
to
the
sea
north
from
the
sea
west
to
the
sea
east

and
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
northward
did
dwell
in
tents
and
in
houses
of
cement
and
they
did
suffer
whatsoever
tree
should
spring
up
upon
the
face
of
the
land
that
it
should
grow
up
that
in
time
they
might
have
timber
to
build
their
houses
yea
their
cities
and
their
temples
and
their
synagogues
and
their
sanctuaries
and
all
manner
of
their
buildings

and
it
came
to
pass
as
timber
was
exceedingly
scarce
in
the
land
northward
they
did
send
forth
much
by
the
way
of
shipping

and
thus
they
did
enable
the
people
in
the
land
northward
that
they
might
build
many
cities
both
of
wood
and
of
cement

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
of
the
people
of
ammon
who
were
lamanites
by
birth
did
also
go
forth
into
this
land

and
now
there
are
many
records
kept
of
the
proceedings
of
this
people
by
many
of
this
people
which
are
particular
and
very
large
concerning
them

but
behold
a
hundredth
part
of
the
proceedings
of
this
people
yea
the
account
of
the
lamanites
and
of
the
nephites
and
their
wars
and
contentions
and
dissensions
and
their
preaching
and
their
prophecies
and
their
shipping
and
their
building
of
ships
and
their
building
of
temples
and
of
synagogues
and
their
sanctuaries
and
their
righteousness
and
their
wickedness
and
their
murders
and
their
robbings
and
their
plundering
and
all
manner
of
abominations
and
whoredoms
cannot
be
contained
in
this
work

but
behold
there
are
many
books
and
many
records
of
every
kind
and
they
have
been
kept
chiefly
by
the
nephites

and
they
have
been
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
another
by
the
nephites
even
until
they
have
fallen
into
transgression
and
have
been
murdered
plundered
and
hunted
and
driven
forth
and
slain
and
scattered
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
mixed
with
the
lamanites
until
they
are
no
more
called
the
nephites
becoming
wicked
and
wild
and
ferocious
yea
even
becoming
lamanites

and
now
i
return
again
to
mine
account
therefore
what
i
have
spoken
had
passed
after
there
had
been
great
contentions
and
disturbances
and
wars
and
dissensions
among
the
people
of
nephi

the
forty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
ended

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
still
great
contention
in
the
land
yea
even
in
the
forty
and
seventh
year
and
also
in
the
forty
and
eighth
year

nevertheless
helaman
did
fill
the
judgmentseat
with
justice
and
equity
yea
he
did
observe
to
keep
the
statutes
and
the
judgments
and
the
commandments
of
god
and
he
did
do
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
god
continually
and
he
did
walk
after
the
ways
of
his
father
insomuch
that
he
did
prosper
in
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
had
two
sons
he
gave
unto
the
eldest
the
name
of
nephi
and
unto
the
youngest
the
name
of
lehi
and
they
began
to
grow
up
unto
the
lord

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
wars
and
contentions
began
to
cease
in
a
small
degree
among
the
people
of
the
nephites
in
the
latter
end
of
the
forty
and
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
forty
and
ninth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
there
was
continual
peace
established
in
the
land
all
save
it
were
the
secret
combinations
which
gadianton
the
robber
had
established
in
the
more
settled
parts
of
the
land
which
at
that
time
were
not
known
unto
those
who
were
at
the
head
of
government
therefore
they
were
not
destroyed
out
of
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
same
year
there
was
exceedingly
great
prosperity
in
the
church
insomuch
that
there
were
thousands
who
did
join
themselves
unto
the
church
and
were
baptized
unto
repentance

and
so
great
was
the
prosperity
of
the
church
and
so
many
the
blessings
which
were
poured
out
upon
the
people
that
even
the
high
priests
and
the
teachers
were
themselves
astonished
beyond
measure

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
work
of
the
lord
did
prosper
unto
the
baptizing
and
uniting
to
the
church
of
god
many
souls
yea
even
tens
of
thousands

thus
we
may
see
that
the
lord
is
merciful
unto
all
who
will
in
the
sincerity
of
their
hearts
call
upon
his
holy
name

yea
thus
we
see
that
the
gate
of
heaven
is
open
unto
all
even
to
those
who
will
believe
on
the
name
of
jesus
christ
who
is
the
son
of
god

yea
we
see
that
whosoever
will
may
lay
hold
upon
the
word
of
god
which
is
quick
and
powerful
which
shall
divide
asunder
all
the
cunning
and
the
snares
and
the
wiles
of
the
devil
and
lead
the
man
of
christ
in
a
strait
and
narrow
course
across
that
everlasting
gulf
of
misery
which
is
prepared
to
engulf
the
wicked

and
land
their
souls
yea
their
immortal
souls
at
the
right
hand
of
god
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
to
sit
down
with
abraham
and
isaac
and
with
jacob
and
with
all
our
holy
fathers
to
go
no
more
out

and
in
this
year
there
was
continual
rejoicing
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
in
all
the
regions
round
about
even
in
all
the
land
which
was
possessed
by
the
nephites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
peace
and
exceedingly
great
joy
in
the
remainder
of
the
forty
and
ninth
year
yea
and
also
there
was
continual
peace
and
great
joy
in
the
fiftieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges

and
in
the
fifty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
there
was
peace
also
save
it
were
the
pride
which
began
to
enter
into
the
churchnot
into
the
church
of
god
but
into
the
hearts
of
the
people
who
professed
to
belong
to
the
church
of
god

and
they
were
lifted
up
in
pride
even
to
the
persecution
of
many
of
their
brethren
now
this
was
a
great
evil
which
did
cause
the
more
humble
part
of
the
people
to
suffer
great
persecutions
and
to
wade
through
much
affliction

nevertheless
they
did
fast
and
pray
oft
and
did
wax
stronger
and
stronger
in
their
humility
and
firmer
and
firmer
in
the
faith
of
christ
unto
the
filling
their
souls
with
joy
and
consolation
yea
even
to
the
purifying
and
the
sanctification
of
their
hearts
which
sanctification
cometh
because
of
their
yielding
their
hearts
unto
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
fifty
and
second
year
ended
in
peace
also
save
it
were
the
exceedingly
great
pride
which
had
gotten
into
the
hearts
of
the
people
and
it
was
because
of
their
exceedingly
great
riches
and
their
prosperity
in
the
land
and
it
did
grow
upon
them
from
day
to
day

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fifty
and
third
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
helaman
died
and
his
eldest
son
nephi
began
to
reign
in
his
stead
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
fill
the
judgmentseat
with
justice
and
equity
yea
he
did
keep
the
commandments
of
god
and
did
walk
in
the
ways
of
his
father
helaman
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fifty
and
fourth
year
there
were
many
dissensions
in
the
church
and
there
was
also
a
contention
among
the
people
insomuch
that
there
was
much
bloodshed

and
the
rebellious
part
were
slain
and
driven
out
of
the
land
and
they
did
go
unto
the
king
of
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
endeavor
to
stir
up
the
lamanites
to
war
against
the
nephites
but
behold
the
lamanites
were
exceedingly
afraid
insomuch
that
they
would
not
hearken
to
the
words
of
those
dissenters

but
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fifty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
there
were
dissenters
who
went
up
from
the
nephites
unto
the
lamanites
and
they
succeeded
with
those
others
in
stirring
them
up
to
anger
against
the
nephites
and
they
were
all
that
year
preparing
for
war

and
in
the
fifty
and
seventh
year
they
did
come
down
against
the
nephites
to
battle
and
they
did
commence
the
work
of
death
yea
insomuch
that
in
the
fifty
and
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
they
succeeded
in
obtaining
possession
of
the
land
of
zarahemla
yea
and
also
all
the
lands
even
unto
the
land
which
was
near
the
land
bountiful

and
the
nephites
and
the
armies
of
moronihah
were
driven
even
into
the
land
of
bountiful

and
there
they
did
fortify
against
the
lamanites
from
the
west
sea
even
unto
the
east
it
being
a
days
journey
for
a
nephite
on
the
line
which
they
had
fortified
and
stationed
their
armies
to
defend
their
north
country

and
thus
those
dissenters
of
the
nephites
with
the
help
of
a
numerous
army
of
the
lamanites
had
obtained
all
the
possession
of
the
nephites
which
was
in
the
land
southward
and
all
this
was
done
in
the
fifty
and
eighth
and
ninth
years
of
the
reign
of
the
judges

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
sixtieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
moronihah
did
succeed
with
his
armies
in
obtaining
many
parts
of
the
land
yea
they
regained
many
cities
which
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
sixty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
they
succeeded
in
regaining
even
the
half
of
all
their
possessions

now
this
great
loss
of
the
nephites
and
the
great
slaughter
which
was
among
them
would
not
have
happened
had
it
not
been
for
their
wickedness
and
their
abomination
which
was
among
them
yea
and
it
was
among
those
also
who
professed
to
belong
to
the
church
of
god

and
it
was
because
of
the
pride
of
their
hearts
because
of
their
exceeding
riches
yea
it
was
because
of
their
oppression
to
the
poor
withholding
their
food
from
the
hungry
withholding
their
clothing
from
the
naked
and
smiting
their
humble
brethren
upon
the
cheek
making
a
mock
of
that
which
was
sacred
denying
the
spirit
of
prophecy
and
of
revelation
murdering
plundering
lying
stealing
committing
adultery
rising
up
in
great
contentions
and
deserting
away
into
the
land
of
nephi
among
the
lamanites

and
because
of
this
their
great
wickedness
and
their
boastings
in
their
own
strength
they
were
left
in
their
own
strength
therefore
they
did
not
prosper
but
were
afflicted
and
smitten
and
driven
before
the
lamanites
until
they
had
lost
possession
of
almost
all
their
lands

but
behold
moronihah
did
preach
many
things
unto
the
people
because
of
their
iniquity
and
also
nephi
and
lehi
who
were
the
sons
of
helaman
did
preach
many
things
unto
the
people
yea
and
did
prophesy
many
things
unto
them
concerning
their
iniquities
and
what
should
come
unto
them
if
they
did
not
repent
of
their
sins

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
repent
and
inasmuch
as
they
did
repent
they
did
begin
to
prosper

for
when
moronihah
saw
that
they
did
repent
he
did
venture
to
lead
them
forth
from
place
to
place
and
from
city
to
city
even
until
they
had
regained
the
onehalf
of
their
property
and
the
onehalf
of
all
their
lands

and
thus
ended
the
sixty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
sixty
and
second
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
that
moronihah
could
obtain
no
more
possessions
over
the
lamanites

therefore
they
did
abandon
their
design
to
obtain
the
remainder
of
their
lands
for
so
numerous
were
the
lamanites
that
it
became
impossible
for
the
nephites
to
obtain
more
power
over
them
therefore
moronihah
did
employ
all
his
armies
in
maintaining
those
parts
which
he
had
taken

and
it
came
to
pass
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
number
of
the
lamanites
the
nephites
were
in
great
fear
lest
they
should
be
overpowered
and
trodden
down
and
slain
and
destroyed

yea
they
began
to
remember
the
prophecies
of
alma
and
also
the
words
of
mosiah
and
they
saw
that
they
had
been
a
stiffnecked
people
and
that
they
had
set
at
naught
the
commandments
of
god

and
that
they
had
altered
and
trampled
under
their
feet
the
laws
of
mosiah
or
that
which
the
lord
commanded
him
to
give
unto
the
people
and
they
saw
that
their
laws
had
become
corrupted
and
that
they
had
become
a
wicked
people
insomuch
that
they
were
wicked
even
like
unto
the
lamanites

and
because
of
their
iniquity
the
church
had
begun
to
dwindle
and
they
began
to
disbelieve
in
the
spirit
of
prophecy
and
in
the
spirit
of
revelation
and
the
judgments
of
god
did
stare
them
in
the
face

and
they
saw
that
they
had
become
weak
like
unto
their
brethren
the
lamanites
and
that
the
spirit
of
the
lord
did
no
more
preserve
them
yea
it
had
withdrawn
from
them
because
the
spirit
of
the
lord
doth
not
dwell
in
unholy
temples

therefore
the
lord
did
cease
to
preserve
them
by
his
miraculous
and
matchless
power
for
they
had
fallen
into
a
state
of
unbelief
and
awful
wickedness
and
they
saw
that
the
lamanites
were
exceedingly
more
numerous
than
they
and
except
they
should
cleave
unto
the
lord
their
god
they
must
unavoidably
perish

for
behold
they
saw
that
the
strength
of
the
lamanites
was
as
great
as
their
strength
even
man
for
man
and
thus
had
they
fallen
into
this
great
transgression
yea
thus
had
they
become
weak
because
of
their
transgression
in
the
space
of
not
many
years
helaman
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
same
year
behold
nephi
delivered
up
the
judgmentseat
to
a
man
whose
name
was
cezoram

for
as
their
laws
and
their
governments
were
established
by
the
voice
of
the
people
and
they
who
chose
evil
were
more
numerous
than
they
who
chose
good
therefore
they
were
ripening
for
destruction
for
the
laws
had
become
corrupted

yea
and
this
was
not
all
they
were
a
stiffnecked
people
insomuch
that
they
could
not
be
governed
by
the
law
nor
justice
save
it
were
to
their
destruction

and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephi
had
become
weary
because
of
their
iniquity
and
he
yielded
up
the
judgmentseat
and
took
it
upon
him
to
preach
the
word
of
god
all
the
remainder
of
his
days
and
his
brother
lehi
also
all
the
remainder
of
his
days

for
they
remembered
the
words
which
their
father
helaman
spake
unto
them
and
these
are
the
words
which
he
spake

behold
my
sons
i
desire
that
ye
should
remember
to
keep
the
commandments
of
god
and
i
would
that
ye
should
declare
unto
the
people
these
words
behold
i
have
given
unto
you
the
names
of
our
first
parents
who
came
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
this
i
have
done
that
when
you
remember
your
names
ye
may
remember
them
and
when
ye
remember
them
ye
may
remember
their
works
and
when
ye
remember
their
works
ye
may
know
how
that
it
is
said
and
also
written
that
they
were
good

therefore
my
sons
i
would
that
ye
should
do
that
which
is
good
that
it
may
be
said
of
you
and
also
written
even
as
it
has
been
said
and
written
of
them

and
now
my
sons
behold
i
have
somewhat
more
to
desire
of
you
which
desire
is
that
ye
may
not
do
these
things
that
ye
may
boast
but
that
ye
may
do
these
things
to
lay
up
for
yourselves
a
treasure
in
heaven
yea
which
is
eternal
and
which
fadeth
not
away
yea
that
ye
may
have
that
precious
gift
of
eternal
life
which
we
have
reason
to
suppose
hath
been
given
to
our
fathers

o
remember
remember
my
sons
the
words
which
king
benjamin
spake
unto
his
people
yea
remember
that
there
is
no
other
way
nor
means
whereby
man
can
be
saved
only
through
the
atoning
blood
of
jesus
christ
who
shall
come
yea
remember
that
he
cometh
to
redeem
the
world

and
remember
also
the
words
which
amulek
spake
unto
zeezrom
in
the
city
of
ammonihah
for
he
said
unto
him
that
the
lord
surely
should
come
to
redeem
his
people
but
that
he
should
not
come
to
redeem
them
in
their
sins
but
to
redeem
them
from
their
sins

and
he
hath
power
given
unto
him
from
the
father
to
redeem
them
from
their
sins
because
of
repentance
therefore
he
hath
sent
his
angels
to
declare
the
tidings
of
the
conditions
of
repentance
which
bringeth
unto
the
power
of
the
redeemer
unto
the
salvation
of
their
souls

and
now
my
sons
remember
remember
that
it
is
upon
the
rock
of
our
redeemer
who
is
christ
the
son
of
god
that
ye
must
build
your
foundation
that
when
the
devil
shall
send
forth
his
mighty
winds
yea
his
shafts
in
the
whirlwind
yea
when
all
his
hail
and
his
mighty
storm
shall
beat
upon
you
it
shall
have
no
power
over
you
to
drag
you
down
to
the
gulf
of
misery
and
endless
wo
because
of
the
rock
upon
which
ye
are
built
which
is
a
sure
foundation
a
foundation
whereon
if
men
build
they
cannot
fall

and
it
came
to
pass
that
these
were
the
words
which
helaman
taught
to
his
sons
yea
he
did
teach
them
many
things
which
are
not
written
and
also
many
things
which
are
written

and
they
did
remember
his
words
and
therefore
they
went
forth
keeping
the
commandments
of
god
to
teach
the
word
of
god
among
all
the
people
of
nephi
beginning
at
the
city
bountiful

and
from
thenceforth
to
the
city
of
gid
and
from
the
city
of
gid
to
the
city
of
mulek

and
even
from
one
city
to
another
until
they
had
gone
forth
among
all
the
people
of
nephi
who
were
in
the
land
southward
and
from
thence
into
the
land
of
zarahemla
among
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
preach
with
great
power
insomuch
that
they
did
confound
many
of
those
dissenters
who
had
gone
over
from
the
nephites
insomuch
that
they
came
forth
and
did
confess
their
sins
and
were
baptized
unto
repentance
and
immediately
returned
to
the
nephites
to
endeavor
to
repair
unto
them
the
wrongs
which
they
had
done

and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephi
and
lehi
did
preach
unto
the
lamanites
with
such
great
power
and
authority
for
they
had
power
and
authority
given
unto
them
that
they
might
speak
and
they
also
had
what
they
should
speak
given
unto
them

therefore
they
did
speak
unto
the
great
astonishment
of
the
lamanites
to
the
convincing
them
insomuch
that
there
were
eight
thousand
of
the
lamanites
who
were
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
round
about
baptized
unto
repentance
and
were
convinced
of
the
wickedness
of
the
traditions
of
their
fathers

and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephi
and
lehi
did
proceed
from
thence
to
go
to
the
land
of
nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
taken
by
an
army
of
the
lamanites
and
cast
into
prison
yea
even
in
that
same
prison
in
which
ammon
and
his
brethren
were
cast
by
the
servants
of
limhi

and
after
they
had
been
cast
into
prison
many
days
without
food
behold
they
went
forth
into
the
prison
to
take
them
that
they
might
slay
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephi
and
lehi
were
encircled
about
as
if
by
fire
even
insomuch
that
they
durst
not
lay
their
hands
upon
them
for
fear
lest
they
should
be
burned
nevertheless
nephi
and
lehi
were
not
burned
and
they
were
as
standing
in
the
midst
of
fire
and
were
not
burned

and
when
they
saw
that
they
were
encircled
about
with
a
pillar
of
fire
and
that
it
burned
them
not
their
hearts
did
take
courage

for
they
saw
that
the
lamanites
durst
not
lay
their
hands
upon
them
neither
durst
they
come
near
unto
them
but
stood
as
if
they
were
struck
dumb
with
amazement

and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephi
and
lehi
did
stand
forth
and
began
to
speak
unto
them
saying
fear
not
for
behold
it
is
god
that
has
shown
unto
you
this
marvelous
thing
in
the
which
is
shown
unto
you
that
ye
cannot
lay
your
hands
on
us
to
slay
us

and
behold
when
they
had
said
these
words
the
earth
shook
exceedingly
and
the
walls
of
the
prison
did
shake
as
if
they
were
about
to
tumble
to
the
earth
but
behold
they
did
not
fall
and
behold
they
that
were
in
the
prison
were
lamanites
and
nephites
who
were
dissenters

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
overshadowed
with
a
cloud
of
darkness
and
an
awful
solemn
fear
came
upon
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
came
a
voice
as
if
it
were
above
the
cloud
of
darkness
saying
repent
ye
repent
ye
and
seek
no
more
to
destroy
my
servants
whom
i
have
sent
unto
you
to
declare
good
tidings

and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
heard
this
voice
and
beheld
that
it
was
not
a
voice
of
thunder
neither
was
it
a
voice
of
a
great
tumultuous
noise
but
behold
it
was
a
still
voice
of
perfect
mildness
as
if
it
had
been
a
whisper
and
it
did
pierce
even
to
the
very
soul

and
notwithstanding
the
mildness
of
the
voice
behold
the
earth
shook
exceedingly
and
the
walls
of
the
prison
trembled
again
as
if
it
were
about
to
tumble
to
the
earth
and
behold
the
cloud
of
darkness
which
had
overshadowed
them
did
not
disperse

and
behold
the
voice
came
again
saying
repent
ye
repent
ye
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
and
seek
no
more
to
destroy
my
servants
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
earth
shook
again
and
the
walls
trembled

and
also
again
the
third
time
the
voice
came
and
did
speak
unto
them
marvelous
words
which
cannot
be
uttered
by
man
and
the
walls
did
tremble
again
and
the
earth
shook
as
if
it
were
about
to
divide
asunder

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
could
not
flee
because
of
the
cloud
of
darkness
which
did
overshadow
them
yea
and
also
they
were
immovable
because
of
the
fear
which
did
come
upon
them

now
there
was
one
among
them
who
was
a
nephite
by
birth
who
had
once
belonged
to
the
church
of
god
but
had
dissented
from
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
turned
him
about
and
behold
he
saw
through
the
cloud
of
darkness
the
faces
of
nephi
and
lehi
and
behold
they
did
shine
exceedingly
even
as
the
faces
of
angels
and
he
beheld
that
they
did
lift
their
eyes
to
heaven
and
they
were
in
the
attitude
as
if
talking
or
lifting
their
voices
to
some
being
whom
they
beheld

and
it
came
to
pass
that
this
man
did
cry
unto
the
multitude
that
they
might
turn
and
look
and
behold
there
was
power
given
unto
them
that
they
did
turn
and
look
and
they
did
behold
the
faces
of
nephi
and
lehi

and
they
said
unto
the
man
behold
what
do
all
these
things
mean
and
who
is
it
with
whom
these
men
do
converse

now
the
mans
name
was
aminadab
and
aminadab
said
unto
them
they
do
converse
with
the
angels
of
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
said
unto
him
what
shall
we
do
that
this
cloud
of
darkness
may
be
removed
from
overshadowing
us

and
aminadab
said
unto
them
you
must
repent
and
cry
unto
the
voice
even
until
ye
shall
have
faith
in
christ
who
was
taught
unto
you
by
alma
and
amulek
and
zeezrom
and
when
ye
shall
do
this
the
cloud
of
darkness
shall
be
removed
from
overshadowing
you

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
all
did
begin
to
cry
unto
the
voice
of
him
who
had
shaken
the
earth
yea
they
did
cry
even
until
the
cloud
of
darkness
was
dispersed

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
cast
their
eyes
about
and
saw
that
the
cloud
of
darkness
was
dispersed
from
overshadowing
them
behold
they
saw
that
they
were
encircled
about
yea
every
soul
by
a
pillar
of
fire

and
nephi
and
lehi
were
in
the
midst
of
them
yea
they
were
encircled
about
yea
they
were
as
if
in
the
midst
of
a
flaming
fire
yet
it
did
harm
them
not
neither
did
it
take
hold
upon
the
walls
of
the
prison
and
they
were
filled
with
that
joy
which
is
unspeakable
and
full
of
glory

and
behold
the
holy
spirit
of
god
did
come
down
from
heaven
and
did
enter
into
their
hearts
and
they
were
filled
as
if
with
fire
and
they
could
speak
forth
marvelous
words

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
came
a
voice
unto
them
yea
a
pleasant
voice
as
if
it
were
a
whisper
saying

peace
peace
be
unto
you
because
of
your
faith
in
my
well
beloved
who
was
from
the
foundation
of
the
world

and
now
when
they
heard
this
they
cast
up
their
eyes
as
if
to
behold
from
whence
the
voice
came
and
behold
they
saw
the
heavens
open
and
angels
came
down
out
of
heaven
and
ministered
unto
them

and
there
were
about
three
hundred
souls
who
saw
and
heard
these
things
and
they
were
bidden
to
go
forth
and
marvel
not
neither
should
they
doubt

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
go
forth
and
did
minister
unto
the
people
declaring
throughout
all
the
regions
round
about
all
the
things
which
they
had
heard
and
seen
insomuch
that
the
more
part
of
the
lamanites
were
convinced
of
them
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
evidences
which
they
had
received

and
as
many
as
were
convinced
did
lay
down
their
weapons
of
war
and
also
their
hatred
and
the
tradition
of
their
fathers

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
yield
up
unto
the
nephites
the
lands
of
their
possession
helaman
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
sixty
and
second
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
had
ended
all
these
things
had
happened
and
the
lamanites
had
become
the
more
part
of
them
a
righteous
people
insomuch
that
their
righteousness
did
exceed
that
of
the
nephites
because
of
their
firmness
and
their
steadiness
in
the
faith

for
behold
there
were
many
of
the
nephites
who
had
become
hardened
and
impenitent
and
grossly
wicked
insomuch
that
they
did
reject
the
word
of
god
and
all
the
preaching
and
prophesying
which
did
come
among
them

nevertheless
the
people
of
the
church
did
have
great
joy
because
of
the
conversion
of
the
lamanites
yea
because
of
the
church
of
god
which
had
been
established
among
them
and
they
did
fellowship
one
with
another
and
did
rejoice
one
with
another
and
did
have
great
joy

and
it
came
to
pass
that
many
of
the
lamanites
did
come
down
into
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
did
declare
unto
the
people
of
the
nephites
the
manner
of
their
conversion
and
did
exhort
them
to
faith
and
repentance

yea
and
many
did
preach
with
exceedingly
great
power
and
authority
unto
the
bringing
down
many
of
them
into
the
depths
of
humility
to
be
the
humble
followers
of
god
and
the
lamb

and
it
came
to
pass
that
many
of
the
lamanites
did
go
into
the
land
northward
and
also
nephi
and
lehi
went
into
the
land
northward
to
preach
unto
the
people
and
thus
ended
the
sixty
and
third
year

and
behold
there
was
peace
in
all
the
land
insomuch
that
the
nephites
did
go
into
whatsoever
part
of
the
land
they
would
whether
among
the
nephites
or
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
did
also
go
whithersoever
they
would
whether
it
were
among
the
lamanites
or
among
the
nephites
and
thus
they
did
have
free
intercourse
one
with
another
to
buy
and
to
sell
and
to
get
gain
according
to
their
desire

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
became
exceedingly
rich
both
the
lamanites
and
the
nephites
and
they
did
have
an
exceeding
plenty
of
gold
and
of
silver
and
of
all
manner
of
precious
metals
both
in
the
land
south
and
in
the
land
north

now
the
land
south
was
called
lehi
and
the
land
north
was
called
mulek
which
was
after
the
son
of
zedekiah
for
the
lord
did
bring
mulek
into
the
land
north
and
lehi
into
the
land
south

and
behold
there
was
all
manner
of
gold
in
both
these
lands
and
of
silver
and
of
precious
ore
of
every
kind
and
there
were
also
curious
workmen
who
did
work
all
kinds
of
ore
and
did
refine
it
and
thus
they
did
become
rich

they
did
raise
grain
in
abundance
both
in
the
north
and
in
the
south
and
they
did
flourish
exceedingly
both
in
the
north
and
in
the
south
and
they
did
multiply
and
wax
exceedingly
strong
in
the
land
and
they
did
raise
many
flocks
and
herds
yea
many
fatlings

behold
their
women
did
toil
and
spin
and
did
make
all
manner
of
cloth
of
finetwined
linen
and
cloth
of
every
kind
to
clothe
their
nakedness
and
thus
the
sixty
and
fourth
year
did
pass
away
in
peace

and
in
the
sixty
and
fifth
year
they
did
also
have
great
joy
and
peace
yea
much
preaching
and
many
prophecies
concerning
that
which
was
to
come
and
thus
passed
away
the
sixty
and
fifth
year

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
sixty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
behold
cezoram
was
murdered
by
an
unknown
hand
as
he
sat
upon
the
judgmentseat
and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
same
year
that
his
son
who
had
been
appointed
by
the
people
in
his
stead
was
also
murdered
and
thus
ended
the
sixty
and
sixth
year

and
in
the
commencement
of
the
sixty
and
seventh
year
the
people
began
to
grow
exceedingly
wicked
again

for
behold
the
lord
had
blessed
them
so
long
with
the
riches
of
the
world
that
they
had
not
been
stirred
up
to
anger
to
wars
nor
to
bloodshed
therefore
they
began
to
set
their
hearts
upon
their
riches
yea
they
began
to
seek
to
get
gain
that
they
might
be
lifted
up
one
above
another
therefore
they
began
to
commit
secret
murders
and
to
rob
and
to
plunder
that
they
might
get
gain

and
now
behold
those
murderers
and
plunderers
were
a
band
who
had
been
formed
by
kishkumen
and
gadianton
and
now
it
had
come
to
pass
that
there
were
many
even
among
the
nephites
of
gadiantons
band
but
behold
they
were
more
numerous
among
the
more
wicked
part
of
the
lamanites
and
they
were
called
gadiantons
robbers
and
murderers

and
it
was
they
who
did
murder
the
chief
judge
cezoram
and
his
son
while
in
the
judgmentseat
and
behold
they
were
not
found

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lamanites
found
that
there
were
robbers
among
them
they
were
exceedingly
sorrowful
and
they
did
use
every
means
in
their
power
to
destroy
them
off
the
face
of
the
earth

but
behold
satan
did
stir
up
the
hearts
of
the
more
part
of
the
nephites
insomuch
that
they
did
unite
with
those
bands
of
robbers
and
did
enter
into
their
covenants
and
their
oaths
that
they
would
protect
and
preserve
one
another
in
whatsoever
difficult
circumstances
they
should
be
placed
that
they
should
not
suffer
for
their
murders
and
their
plunderings
and
their
stealings

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
have
their
signs
yea
their
secret
signs
and
their
secret
words
and
this
that
they
might
distinguish
a
brother
who
had
entered
into
the
covenant
that
whatsoever
wickedness
his
brother
should
do
he
should
not
be
injured
by
his
brother
nor
by
those
who
did
belong
to
his
band
who
had
taken
this
covenant

and
thus
they
might
murder
and
plunder
and
steal
and
commit
whoredoms
and
all
manner
of
wickedness
contrary
to
the
laws
of
their
country
and
also
the
laws
of
their
god

and
whosoever
of
those
who
belonged
to
their
band
should
reveal
unto
the
world
of
their
wickedness
and
their
abominations
should
be
tried
not
according
to
the
laws
of
their
country
but
according
to
the
laws
of
their
wickedness
which
had
been
given
by
gadianton
and
kishkumen

now
behold
it
is
these
secret
oaths
and
covenants
which
alma
commanded
his
son
should
not
go
forth
unto
the
world
lest
they
should
be
a
means
of
bringing
down
the
people
unto
destruction

now
behold
those
secret
oaths
and
covenants
did
not
come
forth
unto
gadianton
from
the
records
which
were
delivered
unto
helaman
but
behold
they
were
put
into
the
heart
of
gadianton
by
that
same
being
who
did
entice
our
first
parents
to
partake
of
the
forbidden
fruit

yea
that
same
being
who
did
plot
with
cain
that
if
he
would
murder
his
brother
abel
it
should
not
be
known
unto
the
world
and
he
did
plot
with
cain
and
his
followers
from
that
time
forth

and
also
it
is
that
same
being
who
put
it
into
the
hearts
of
the
people
to
build
a
tower
sufficiently
high
that
they
might
get
to
heaven
and
it
was
that
same
being
who
led
on
the
people
who
came
from
that
tower
into
this
land
who
spread
the
works
of
darkness
and
abominations
over
all
the
face
of
the
land
until
he
dragged
the
people
down
to
an
entire
destruction
and
to
an
everlasting
hell

yea
it
is
that
same
being
who
put
it
into
the
heart
of
gadianton
to
still
carry
on
the
work
of
darkness
and
of
secret
murder
and
he
has
brought
it
forth
from
the
beginning
of
man
even
down
to
this
time

and
behold
it
is
he
who
is
the
author
of
all
sin
and
behold
he
doth
carry
on
his
works
of
darkness
and
secret
murder
and
doth
hand
down
their
plots
and
their
oaths
and
their
covenants
and
their
plans
of
awful
wickedness
from
generation
to
generation
according
as
he
can
get
hold
upon
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men

and
now
behold
he
had
got
great
hold
upon
the
hearts
of
the
nephites
yea
insomuch
that
they
had
become
exceedingly
wicked
yea
the
more
part
of
them
had
turned
out
of
the
way
of
righteousness
and
did
trample
under
their
feet
the
commandments
of
god
and
did
turn
unto
their
own
ways
and
did
build
up
unto
themselves
idols
of
their
gold
and
their
silver

and
it
came
to
pass
that
all
these
iniquities
did
come
unto
them
in
the
space
of
not
many
years
insomuch
that
a
more
part
of
it
had
come
unto
them
in
the
sixty
and
seventh
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi

and
they
did
grow
in
their
iniquities
in
the
sixty
and
eighth
year
also

and
thus
we
see
that
the
nephites
did
begin
to
dwindle
in
unbelief
and
grow
in
wickedness
and
abominations
while
the
lamanites
began
to
grow
exceedingly
in
the
knowledge
of
their
god
yea
they
did
begin
to
keep
his
statutes
and
commandments
and
to
walk
in
truth
and
uprightness
before
him

and
thus
we
see
that
the
spirit
of
the
lord
began
to
withdraw
from
the
nephites
because
of
the
wickedness
and
the
hardness
of
their
hearts

and
thus
we
see
that
the
lord
began
to
pour
out
his
spirit
upon
the
lamanites
because
of
their
easiness
and
willingness
to
believe
in
his
words

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
did
hunt
the
band
of
robbers
of
gadianton
and
they
did
preach
the
word
of
god
among
the
more
wicked
part
of
them
insomuch
that
this
band
of
robbers
was
utterly
destroyed
from
among
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
other
hand
that
the
nephites
did
build
them
up
and
support
them
beginning
at
the
more
wicked
part
of
them
until
they
had
overspread
all
the
land
of
the
nephites
and
had
seduced
the
more
part
of
the
righteous
until
they
had
come
down
to
believe
in
their
works
and
partake
of
their
spoils
and
to
join
with
them
in
their
secret
murders
and
combinations

and
thus
they
did
obtain
the
sole
management
of
the
government
insomuch
that
they
did
trample
under
their
feet
and
smite
and
rend
and
turn
their
backs
upon
the
poor
and
the
meek
and
the
humble
followers
of
god

and
thus
we
see
that
they
were
in
an
awful
state
and
ripening
for
an
everlasting
destruction

and
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
ended
the
sixty
and
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
helaman
chapter


behold
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
sixty
and
ninth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
the
nephites
that
nephi
the
son
of
helaman
returned
to
the
land
of
zarahemla
from
the
land
northward

for
he
had
been
forth
among
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
northward
and
did
preach
the
word
of
god
unto
them
and
did
prophesy
many
things
unto
them

and
they
did
reject
all
his
words
insomuch
that
he
could
not
stay
among
them
but
returned
again
unto
the
land
of
his
nativity

and
seeing
the
people
in
a
state
of
such
awful
wickedness
and
those
gadianton
robbers
filling
the
judgmentseatshaving
usurped
the
power
and
authority
of
the
land
laying
aside
the
commandments
of
god
and
not
in
the
least
aright
before
him
doing
no
justice
unto
the
children
of
men

condemning
the
righteous
because
of
their
righteousness
letting
the
guilty
and
the
wicked
go
unpunished
because
of
their
money
and
moreover
to
be
held
in
office
at
the
head
of
government
to
rule
and
do
according
to
their
wills
that
they
might
get
gain
and
glory
of
the
world
and
moreover
that
they
might
the
more
easily
commit
adultery
and
steal
and
kill
and
do
according
to
their
own
wills

now
this
great
iniquity
had
come
upon
the
nephites
in
the
space
of
not
many
years
and
when
nephi
saw
it
his
heart
was
swollen
with
sorrow
within
his
breast
and
he
did
exclaim
in
the
agony
of
his
soul

oh
that
i
could
have
had
my
days
in
the
days
when
my
father
nephi
first
came
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
that
i
could
have
joyed
with
him
in
the
promised
land
then
were
his
people
easy
to
be
entreated
firm
to
keep
the
commandments
of
god
and
slow
to
be
led
to
do
iniquity
and
they
were
quick
to
hearken
unto
the
words
of
the
lord

yea
if
my
days
could
have
been
in
those
days
then
would
my
soul
have
had
joy
in
the
righteousness
of
my
brethren

but
behold
i
am
consigned
that
these
are
my
days
and
that
my
soul
shall
be
filled
with
sorrow
because
of
this
the
wickedness
of
my
brethren

and
behold
now
it
came
to
pass
that
it
was
upon
a
tower
which
was
in
the
garden
of
nephi
which
was
by
the
highway
which
led
to
the
chief
market
which
was
in
the
city
of
zarahemla
therefore
nephi
had
bowed
himself
upon
the
tower
which
was
in
his
garden
which
tower
was
also
near
unto
the
garden
gate
by
which
led
the
highway

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
certain
men
passing
by
and
saw
nephi
as
he
was
pouring
out
his
soul
unto
god
upon
the
tower
and
they
ran
and
told
the
people
what
they
had
seen
and
the
people
came
together
in
multitudes
that
they
might
know
the
cause
of
so
great
mourning
for
the
wickedness
of
the
people

and
now
when
nephi
arose
he
beheld
the
multitudes
of
people
who
had
gathered
together

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
opened
his
mouth
and
said
unto
them
behold
why
have
ye
gathered
yourselves
together
that
i
may
tell
you
of
your
iniquities

yea
because
i
have
got
upon
my
tower
that
i
might
pour
out
my
soul
unto
my
god
because
of
the
exceeding
sorrow
of
my
heart
which
is
because
of
your
iniquities

and
because
of
my
mourning
and
lamentation
ye
have
gathered
yourselves
together
and
do
marvel
yea
and
ye
have
great
need
to
marvel
yea
ye
ought
to
marvel
because
ye
are
given
away
that
the
devil
has
got
so
great
hold
upon
your
hearts

yea
how
could
you
have
given
way
to
the
enticing
of
him
who
is
seeking
to
hurl
away
your
souls
down
to
everlasting
misery
and
endless
wo

o
repent
ye
repent
ye
why
will
ye
die
turn
ye
turn
ye
unto
the
lord
your
god
why
has
he
forsaken
you

it
is
because
you
have
hardened
your
hearts
yea
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
good
shepherd
yea
ye
have
provoked
him
to
anger
against
you

and
behold
instead
of
gathering
you
except
ye
will
repent
behold
he
shall
scatter
you
forth
that
ye
shall
become
meat
for
dogs
and
wild
beasts

o
how
could
you
have
forgotten
your
god
in
the
very
day
that
he
has
delivered
you

but
behold
it
is
to
get
gain
to
be
praised
of
men
yea
and
that
ye
might
get
gold
and
silver
and
ye
have
set
your
hearts
upon
the
riches
and
the
vain
things
of
this
world
for
the
which
ye
do
murder
and
plunder
and
steal
and
bear
false
witness
against
your
neighbor
and
do
all
manner
of
iniquity

and
for
this
cause
wo
shall
come
unto
you
except
ye
shall
repent
for
if
ye
will
not
repent
behold
this
great
city
and
also
all
those
great
cities
which
are
round
about
which
are
in
the
land
of
our
possession
shall
be
taken
away
that
ye
shall
have
no
place
in
them
for
behold
the
lord
will
not
grant
unto
you
strength
as
he
has
hitherto
done
to
withstand
against
your
enemies

for
behold
thus
saith
the
lord
i
will
not
show
unto
the
wicked
of
my
strength
to
one
more
than
the
other
save
it
be
unto
those
that
repent
of
their
sins
and
hearken
unto
my
words
now
therefore
i
would
that
ye
should
behold
my
brethren
that
it
shall
be
better
for
the
lamanites
than
for
you
except
ye
shall
repent

for
behold
they
are
more
righteous
than
you
for
they
have
not
sinned
against
that
great
knowledge
which
ye
have
received
therefore
the
lord
will
be
merciful
unto
them
yea
he
will
lengthen
out
their
days
and
increase
their
seed
even
when
thou
shalt
be
utterly
destroyed
except
thou
shalt
repent

yea
wo
be
unto
you
because
of
that
great
abomination
which
has
come
among
you
and
ye
have
united
yourselves
unto
it
yea
to
that
secret
band
which
was
established
by
gadianton

yea
wo
shall
come
unto
you
because
of
that
pride
which
ye
have
suffered
to
enter
your
hearts
which
has
lifted
you
up
beyond
that
which
is
good
because
of
your
exceedingly
great
riches

yea
wo
be
unto
you
because
of
your
wickedness
and
abominations

and
except
ye
repent
ye
shall
perish
yea
even
your
lands
shall
be
taken
from
you
and
ye
shall
be
destroyed
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth

behold
now
i
do
not
say
that
these
things
shall
be
of
myself
because
it
is
not
of
myself
that
i
know
these
things
but
behold
i
know
that
these
things
are
true
because
the
lord
god
has
made
them
known
unto
me
therefore
i
testify
that
they
shall
be
helaman
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
nephi
had
said
these
words
behold
there
were
men
who
were
judges
who
also
belonged
to
the
secret
band
of
gadianton
and
they
were
angry
and
they
cried
out
against
him
saying
unto
the
people
why
do
ye
not
seize
upon
this
man
and
bring
him
forth
that
he
may
be
condemned
according
to
the
crime
which
he
has
done

why
seest
thou
this
man
and
hearest
him
revile
against
this
people
and
against
our
law

for
behold
nephi
had
spoken
unto
them
concerning
the
corruptness
of
their
law
yea
many
things
did
nephi
speak
which
cannot
be
written
and
nothing
did
he
speak
which
was
contrary
to
the
commandments
of
god

and
those
judges
were
angry
with
him
because
he
spake
plainly
unto
them
concerning
their
secret
works
of
darkness
nevertheless
they
durst
not
lay
their
own
hands
upon
him
for
they
feared
the
people
lest
they
should
cry
out
against
them

therefore
they
did
cry
unto
the
people
saying
why
do
you
suffer
this
man
to
revile
against
us
for
behold
he
doth
condemn
all
this
people
even
unto
destruction
yea
and
also
that
these
our
great
cities
shall
be
taken
from
us
that
we
shall
have
no
place
in
them

and
now
we
know
that
this
is
impossible
for
behold
we
are
powerful
and
our
cities
great
therefore
our
enemies
can
have
no
power
over
us

and
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
they
did
stir
up
the
people
to
anger
against
nephi
and
raised
contentions
among
them
for
there
were
some
who
did
cry
out
let
this
man
alone
for
he
is
a
good
man
and
those
things
which
he
saith
will
surely
come
to
pass
except
we
repent

yea
behold
all
the
judgments
will
come
upon
us
which
he
has
testified
unto
us
for
we
know
that
he
has
testified
aright
unto
us
concerning
our
iniquities
and
behold
they
are
many
and
he
knoweth
as
well
all
things
which
shall
befall
us
as
he
knoweth
of
our
iniquities

yea
and
behold
if
he
had
not
been
a
prophet
he
could
not
have
testified
concerning
those
things

and
it
came
to
pass
that
those
people
who
sought
to
destroy
nephi
were
compelled
because
of
their
fear
that
they
did
not
lay
their
hands
on
him
therefore
he
began
again
to
speak
unto
them
seeing
that
he
had
gained
favor
in
the
eyes
of
some
insomuch
that
the
remainder
of
them
did
fear

therefore
he
was
constrained
to
speak
more
unto
them
saying
behold
my
brethren
have
ye
not
read
that
god
gave
power
unto
one
man
even
moses
to
smite
upon
the
waters
of
the
red
sea
and
they
parted
hither
and
thither
insomuch
that
the
israelites
who
were
our
fathers
came
through
upon
dry
ground
and
the
waters
closed
upon
the
armies
of
the
egyptians
and
swallowed
them
up

and
now
behold
if
god
gave
unto
this
man
such
power
then
why
should
ye
dispute
among
yourselves
and
say
that
he
hath
given
unto
me
no
power
whereby
i
may
know
concerning
the
judgments
that
shall
come
upon
you
except
ye
repent

but
behold
ye
not
only
deny
my
words
but
ye
also
deny
all
the
words
which
have
been
spoken
by
our
fathers
and
also
the
words
which
were
spoken
by
this
man
moses
who
had
such
great
power
given
unto
him
yea
the
words
which
he
hath
spoken
concerning
the
coming
of
the
messiah

yea
did
he
not
bear
record
that
the
son
of
god
should
come
and
as
he
lifted
up
the
brazen
serpent
in
the
wilderness
even
so
shall
he
be
lifted
up
who
should
come

and
as
many
as
should
look
upon
that
serpent
should
live
even
so
as
many
as
should
look
upon
the
son
of
god
with
faith
having
a
contrite
spirit
might
live
even
unto
that
life
which
is
eternal

and
now
behold
moses
did
not
only
testify
of
these
things
but
also
all
the
holy
prophets
from
his
days
even
to
the
days
of
abraham

yea
and
behold
abraham
saw
of
his
coming
and
was
filled
with
gladness
and
did
rejoice

yea
and
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
abraham
not
only
knew
of
these
things
but
there
were
many
before
the
days
of
abraham
who
were
called
by
the
order
of
god
yea
even
after
the
order
of
his
son
and
this
that
it
should
be
shown
unto
the
people
a
great
many
thousand
years
before
his
coming
that
even
redemption
should
come
unto
them

and
now
i
would
that
ye
should
know
that
even
since
the
days
of
abraham
there
have
been
many
prophets
that
have
testified
these
things
yea
behold
the
prophet
zenos
did
testify
boldly
for
the
which
he
was
slain

and
behold
also
zenock
and
also
ezias
and
also
isaiah
and
jeremiah
jeremiah
being
that
same
prophet
who
testified
of
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
and
now
we
know
that
jerusalem
was
destroyed
according
to
the
words
of
jeremiah
o
then
why
not
the
son
of
god
come
according
to
his
prophecy

and
now
will
you
dispute
that
jerusalem
was
destroyed
will
ye
say
that
the
sons
of
zedekiah
were
not
slain
all
except
it
were
mulek
yea
and
do
ye
not
behold
that
the
seed
of
zedekiah
are
with
us
and
they
were
driven
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
but
behold
this
is
not
all

our
father
lehi
was
driven
out
of
jerusalem
because
he
testified
of
these
things
nephi
also
testified
of
these
things
and
also
almost
all
of
our
fathers
even
down
to
this
time
yea
they
have
testified
of
the
coming
of
christ
and
have
looked
forward
and
have
rejoiced
in
his
day
which
is
to
come

and
behold
he
is
god
and
he
is
with
them
and
he
did
manifest
himself
unto
them
that
they
were
redeemed
by
him
and
they
gave
unto
him
glory
because
of
that
which
is
to
come

and
now
seeing
ye
know
these
things
and
cannot
deny
them
except
ye
shall
lie
therefore
in
this
ye
have
sinned
for
ye
have
rejected
all
these
things
notwithstanding
so
many
evidences
which
ye
have
received
yea
even
ye
have
received
all
things
both
things
in
heaven
and
all
things
which
are
in
the
earth
as
a
witness
that
they
are
true

but
behold
ye
have
rejected
the
truth
and
rebelled
against
your
holy
god
and
even
at
this
time
instead
of
laying
up
for
yourselves
treasures
in
heaven
where
nothing
doth
corrupt
and
where
nothing
can
come
which
is
unclean
ye
are
heaping
up
for
yourselves
wrath
against
the
day
of
judgment

yea
even
at
this
time
ye
are
ripening
because
of
your
murders
and
your
fornication
and
wickedness
for
everlasting
destruction
yea
and
except
ye
repent
it
will
come
unto
you
soon

yea
behold
it
is
now

they

belong

helaman
chapter


behold
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
nephi
had
spoken
these
words
certain
men
who
were
among
them
ran
to
the
judgmentseat
yea
even
there
were
five
who
went
and
they
said
among
themselves
as
they
went

behold
now
we
will
know
of
a
surety
whether
this
man
be
a
prophet
and
god
hath
commanded
him
to
prophesy
such
marvelous
things
unto
us
behold
we
do
not
believe
that
he
hath
yea
we
do
not
believe
that
he
is
a
prophet
nevertheless
if
this
thing
which
he
has
said
concerning
the
chief
judge
be
true
that
he
be
dead
then
will
we
believe
that
the
other
words
which
he
has
spoken
are
true

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
ran
in
their
might
and
came
in
unto
the
judgmentseat
and
behold
the
chief
judge
had
fallen
to
the
earth
and
did
lie
in
his
blood

and
now
behold
when
they
saw
this
they
were
astonished
exceedingly
insomuch
that
they
fell
to
the
earth
for
they
had
not
believed
the
words
which
nephi
had
spoken
concerning
the
chief
judge

but
now
when
they
saw
they
believed
and
fear
came
upon
them
lest
all
the
judgments
which
nephi
had
spoken
should
come
upon
the
people
therefore
they
did
quake
and
had
fallen
to
the
earth

now
immediately
when
the
judge
had
been
murderedhe
being
stabbed
by
his
brother
by
a
garb
of
secrecy
and
he
fled
and
the
servants
ran
and
told
the
people
raising
the
cry
of
murder
among
them

and
behold
the
people
did
gather
themselves
together
unto
the
place
of
the
judgmentseatand
behold
to
their
astonishment
they
saw
those
five
men
who
had
fallen
to
the
earth

and
now
behold
the
people
knew
nothing
concerning
the
multitude
who
had
gathered
together
at
the
garden
of
nephi
therefore
they
said
among
themselves
these
men
are
they
who
have
murdered
the
judge
and
god
has
smitten
them
that
they
could
not
flee
from
us

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
laid
hold
on
them
and
bound
them
and
cast
them
into
prison
and
there
was
a
proclamation
sent
abroad
that
the
judge
was
slain
and
that
the
murderers
had
been
taken
and
were
cast
into
prison

and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
the
people
did
assemble
themselves
together
to
mourn
and
to
fast
at
the
burial
of
the
great
chief
judge
who
had
been
slain

and
thus
also
those
judges
who
were
at
the
garden
of
nephi
and
heard
his
words
were
also
gathered
together
at
the
burial

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
inquired
among
the
people
saying
where
are
the
five
who
were
sent
to
inquire
concerning
the
chief
judge
whether
he
was
dead
and
they
answered
and
said
concerning
this
five
whom
ye
say
ye
have
sent
we
know
not
but
there
are
five
who
are
the
murderers
whom
we
have
cast
into
prison

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
judges
desired
that
they
should
be
brought
and
they
were
brought
and
behold
they
were
the
five
who
were
sent
and
behold
the
judges
inquired
of
them
to
know
concerning
the
matter
and
they
told
them
all
that
they
had
done
saying

we
ran
and
came
to
the
place
of
the
judgmentseat
and
when
we
saw
all
things
even
as
nephi
had
testified
we
were
astonished
insomuch
that
we
fell
to
the
earth
and
when
we
were
recovered
from
our
astonishment
behold
they
cast
us
into
prison

now
as
for
the
murder
of
this
man
we
know
not
who
has
done
it
and
only
this
much
we
know
we
ran
and
came
according
as
ye
desired
and
behold
he
was
dead
according
to
the
words
of
nephi

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
judges
did
expound
the
matter
unto
the
people
and
did
cry
out
against
nephi
saying
behold
we
know
that
this
nephi
must
have
agreed
with
some
one
to
slay
the
judge
and
then
he
might
declare
it
unto
us
that
he
might
convert
us
unto
his
faith
that
he
might
raise
himself
to
be
a
great
man
chosen
of
god
and
a
prophet

and
now
behold
we
will
detect
this
man
and
he
shall
confess
his
fault
and
make
known
unto
us
the
true
murderer
of
this
judge

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
five
were
liberated
on
the
day
of
the
burial
nevertheless
they
did
rebuke
the
judges
in
the
words
which
they
had
spoken
against
nephi
and
did
contend
with
them
one
by
one
insomuch
that
they
did
confound
them

nevertheless
they
caused
that
nephi
should
be
taken
and
bound
and
brought
before
the
multitude
and
they
began
to
question
him
in
divers
ways
that
they
might
cross
him
that
they
might
accuse
him
to
death

saying
unto
him
thou
art
confederate
who
is
this
man
that
hath
done
this
murder
now
tell
us
and
acknowledge
thy
fault
saying
behold
here
is
money
and
also
we
will
grant
unto
thee
thy
life
if
thou
wilt
tell
us
and
acknowledge
the
agreement
which
thou
hast
made
with
him

but
nephi
said
unto
them
o
ye
fools
ye
uncircumcised
of
heart
ye
blind
and
ye
stiffnecked
people
do
ye
know
how
long
the
lord
your
god
will
suffer
you
that
ye
shall
go
on
in
this
your
way
of
sin

o
ye
ought
to
begin
to
howl
and
mourn
because
of
the
great
destruction
which
at
this
time
doth
await
you
except
ye
shall
repent

behold
ye
say
that
i
have
agreed
with
a
man
that
he
should
murder
seezoram
our
chief
judge
but
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
this
is
because
i
have
testified
unto
you
that
ye
might
know
concerning
this
thing
yea
even
for
a
witness
unto
you
that
i
did
know
of
the
wickedness
and
abominations
which
are
among
you

and
because
i
have
done
this
ye
say
that
i
have
agreed
with
a
man
that
he
should
do
this
thing
yea
because
i
showed
unto
you
this
sign
ye
are
angry
with
me
and
seek
to
destroy
my
life

and
now
behold
i
will
show
unto
you
another
sign
and
see
if
ye
will
in
this
thing
seek
to
destroy
me

behold
i
say
unto
you
go
to
the
house
of
seantum
who
is
the
brother
of
seezoram
and
say
unto
him

has
nephi
the
pretended
prophet
who
doth
prophesy
so
much
evil
concerning
this
people
agreed
with
thee
in
the
which
ye
have
murdered
seezoram
who
is
your
brother

and
behold
he
shall
say
unto
you
nay

and
ye
shall
say
unto
him
have
ye
murdered
your
brother

and
he
shall
stand
with
fear
and
wist
not
what
to
say
and
behold
he
shall
deny
unto
you
and
he
shall
make
as
if
he
were
astonished
nevertheless
he
shall
declare
unto
you
that
he
is
innocent

but
behold
ye
shall
examine
him
and
ye
shall
find
blood
upon
the
skirts
of
his
cloak

and
when
ye
have
seen
this
ye
shall
say
from
whence
cometh
this
blood
do
we
not
know
that
it
is
the
blood
of
your
brother

and
then
shall
he
tremble
and
shall
look
pale
even
as
if
death
had
come
upon
him

and
then
shall
ye
say
because
of
this
fear
and
this
paleness
which
has
come
upon
your
face
behold
we
know
that
thou
art
guilty

and
then
shall
greater
fear
come
upon
him
and
then
shall
he
confess
unto
you
and
deny
no
more
that
he
has
done
this
murder

and
then
shall
he
say
unto
you
that
i
nephi
know
nothing
concerning
the
matter
save
it
were
given
unto
me
by
the
power
of
god
and
then
shall
ye
know
that
i
am
an
honest
man
and
that
i
am
sent
unto
you
from
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
and
did
even
according
as
nephi
had
said
unto
them
and
behold
the
words
which
he
had
said
were
true
for
according
to
the
words
he
did
deny
and
also
according
to
the
words
he
did
confess

and
he
was
brought
to
prove
that
he
himself
was
the
very
murderer
insomuch
that
the
five
were
set
at
liberty
and
also
was
nephi

and
there
were
some
of
the
nephites
who
believed
on
the
words
of
nephi
and
there
were
some
also
who
believed
because
of
the
testimony
of
the
five
for
they
had
been
converted
while
they
were
in
prison

and
now
there
were
some
among
the
people
who
said
that
nephi
was
a
prophet

and
there
were
others
who
said
behold
he
is
a
god
for
except
he
was
a
god
he
could
not
know
of
all
things
for
behold
he
has
told
us
the
thoughts
of
our
hearts
and
also
has
told
us
things
and
even
he
has
brought
unto
our
knowledge
the
true
murderer
of
our
chief
judge
helaman
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
arose
a
division
among
the
people
insomuch
that
they
divided
hither
and
thither
and
went
their
ways
leaving
nephi
alone
as
he
was
standing
in
the
midst
of
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephi
went
his
way
towards
his
own
house
pondering
upon
the
things
which
the
lord
had
shown
unto
him

and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
thus
ponderingbeing
much
cast
down
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
people
of
the
nephites
their
secret
works
of
darkness
and
their
murderings
and
their
plunderings
and
all
manner
of
iniquitiesand
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
thus
pondering
in
his
heart
behold
a
voice
came
unto
him
saying

blessed
art
thou
nephi
for
those
things
which
thou
hast
done
for
i
have
beheld
how
thou
hast
with
unwearyingness
declared
the
word
which
i
have
given
unto
thee
unto
this
people
and
thou
hast
not
feared
them
and
hast
not
sought
thine
own
life
but
hast
sought
my
will
and
to
keep
my
commandments
helaman

and
now
because
thou
hast
done
this
with
such
unwearyingness
behold
i
will
bless
thee
forever
and
i
will
make
thee
mighty
in
word
and
in
deed
in
faith
and
in
works
yea
even
that
all
things
shall
be
done
unto
thee
according
to
thy
word
for
thou
shalt
not
ask
that
which
is
contrary
to
my
will

behold
thou
art
nephi
and
i
am
god
behold
i
declare
it
unto
thee
in
the
presence
of
mine
angels
that
ye
shall
have
power
over
this
people
and
shall
smite
the
earth
with
famine
and
with
pestilence
and
destruction
according
to
the
wickedness
of
this
people

behold
i
give
unto
you
power
that
whatsoever
ye
shall
seal
on
earth
shall
be
sealed
in
heaven
and
whatsoever
ye
shall
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
in
heaven
and
thus
shall
ye
have
power
among
this
people

and
thus
if
ye
shall
say
unto
this
temple
it
shall
be
rent
in
twain
it
shall
be
done

and
if
ye
shall
say
unto
this
mountain
be
thou
cast
down
and
become
smooth
it
shall
be
done

and
behold
if
ye
shall
say
that
god
shall
smite
this
people
it
shall
come
to
pass

and
now
behold
i
command
you
that
ye
shall
go
and
declare
unto
this
people
that
thus
saith
the
lord
god
who
is
the
almighty
except
ye
repent
ye
shall
be
smitten
even
unto
destruction

and
behold
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lord
had
spoken
these
words
unto
nephi
he
did
stop
and
did
not
go
unto
his
own
house
but
did
return
unto
the
multitudes
who
were
scattered
about
upon
the
face
of
the
land
and
began
to
declare
unto
them
the
word
of
the
lord
which
had
been
spoken
unto
him
concerning
their
destruction
if
they
did
not
repent

now
behold
notwithstanding
that
great
miracle
which
nephi
had
done
in
telling
them
concerning
the
death
of
the
chief
judge
they
did
harden
their
hearts
and
did
not
hearken
unto
the
words
of
the
lord

therefore
nephi
did
declare
unto
them
the
word
of
the
lord
saying
except
ye
repent
thus
saith
the
lord
ye
shall
be
smitten
even
unto
destruction

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
nephi
had
declared
unto
them
the
word
behold
they
did
still
harden
their
hearts
and
would
not
hearken
unto
his
words
therefore
they
did
revile
against
him
and
did
seek
to
lay
their
hands
upon
him
that
they
might
cast
him
into
prison

but
behold
the
power
of
god
was
with
him
and
they
could
not
take
him
to
cast
him
into
prison
for
he
was
taken
by
the
spirit
and
conveyed
away
out
of
the
midst
of
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
he
did
go
forth
in
the
spirit
from
multitude
to
multitude
declaring
the
word
of
god
even
until
he
had
declared
it
unto
them
all
or
sent
it
forth
among
all
the
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
would
not
hearken
unto
his
words
and
there
began
to
be
contentions
insomuch
that
they
were
divided
against
themselves
and
began
to
slay
one
another
with
the
sword

and
thus
ended
the
seventy
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
helaman
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
seventy
and
second
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
that
the
contentions
did
increase
insomuch
that
there
were
wars
throughout
all
the
land
among
all
the
people
of
nephi

and
it
was
this
secret
band
of
robbers
who
did
carry
on
this
work
of
destruction
and
wickedness
and
this
war
did
last
all
that
year
and
in
the
seventy
and
third
year
it
did
also
last

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
year
nephi
did
cry
unto
the
lord
saying

o
lord
do
not
suffer
that
this
people
shall
be
destroyed
by
the
sword
but
o
lord
rather
let
there
be
a
famine
in
the
land
to
stir
them
up
in
remembrance
of
the
lord
their
god
and
perhaps
they
will
repent
and
turn
unto
thee

and
so
it
was
done
according
to
the
words
of
nephi
and
there
was
a
great
famine
upon
the
land
among
all
the
people
of
nephi
and
thus
in
the
seventy
and
fourth
year
the
famine
did
continue
and
the
work
of
destruction
did
cease
by
the
sword
but
became
sore
by
famine

and
this
work
of
destruction
did
also
continue
in
the
seventy
and
fifth
year
for
the
earth
was
smitten
that
it
was
dry
and
did
not
yield
forth
grain
in
the
season
of
grain
and
the
whole
earth
was
smitten
even
among
the
lamanites
as
well
as
among
the
nephites
so
that
they
were
smitten
that
they
did
perish
by
thousands
in
the
more
wicked
parts
of
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
saw
that
they
were
about
to
perish
by
famine
and
they
began
to
remember
the
lord
their
god
and
they
began
to
remember
the
words
of
nephi

and
the
people
began
to
plead
with
their
chief
judges
and
their
leaders
that
they
would
say
unto
nephi
behold
we
know
that
thou
art
a
man
of
god
and
therefore
cry
unto
the
lord
our
god
that
he
turn
away
from
us
this
famine
lest
all
the
words
which
thou
hast
spoken
concerning
our
destruction
be
fulfilled

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
judges
did
say
unto
nephi
according
to
the
words
which
had
been
desired
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
nephi
saw
that
the
people
had
repented
and
did
humble
themselves
in
sackcloth
he
cried
again
unto
the
lord
saying

o
lord
behold
this
people
repenteth
and
they
have
swept
away
the
band
of
gadianton
from
amongst
them
insomuch
that
they
have
become
extinct
and
they
have
concealed
their
secret
plans
in
the
earth

now
o
lord
because
of
this
their
humility
wilt
thou
turn
away
thine
anger
and
let
thine
anger
be
appeased
in
the
destruction
of
those
wicked
men
whom
thou
hast
already
destroyed

o
lord
wilt
thou
turn
away
thine
anger
yea
thy
fierce
anger
and
cause
that
this
famine
may
cease
in
this
land

o
lord
wilt
thou
hearken
unto
me
and
cause
that
it
may
be
done
according
to
my
words
and
send
forth
rain
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
that
she
may
bring
forth
her
fruit
and
her
grain
in
the
season
of
grain

o
lord
thou
didst
hearken
unto
my
words
when
i
said
let
there
be
a
famine
that
the
pestilence
of
the
sword
might
cease
and
i
know
that
thou
wilt
even
at
this
time
hearken
unto
my
words
for
thou
saidst
that
if
this
people
repent
i
will
spare
them

yea
o
lord
and
thou
seest
that
they
have
repented
because
of
the
famine
and
the
pestilence
and
destruction
which
has
come
unto
them

and
now
o
lord
wilt
thou
turn
away
thine
anger
and
try
again
if
they
will
serve
thee
and
if
so
o
lord
thou
canst
bless
them
according
to
thy
words
which
thou
hast
said

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
seventy
and
sixth
year
the
lord
did
turn
away
his
anger
from
the
people
and
caused
that
rain
should
fall
upon
the
earth
insomuch
that
it
did
bring
forth
her
fruit
in
the
season
of
her
fruit
and
it
came
to
pass
that
it
did
bring
forth
her
grain
in
the
season
of
her
grain

and
behold
the
people
did
rejoice
and
glorify
god
and
the
whole
face
of
the
land
was
filled
with
rejoicing
and
they
did
no
more
seek
to
destroy
nephi
but
they
did
esteem
him
as
a
great
prophet
and
a
man
of
god
having
great
power
and
authority
given
unto
him
from
god

and
behold
lehi
his
brother
was
not
a
whit
behind
him
as
to
things
pertaining
to
righteousness

and
thus
it
did
come
to
pass
that
the
people
of
nephi
began
to
prosper
again
in
the
land
and
began
to
build
up
their
waste
places
and
began
to
multiply
and
spread
even
until
they
did
cover
the
whole
face
of
the
land
both
on
the
northward
and
on
the
southward
from
the
sea
west
to
the
sea
east

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
seventy
and
sixth
year
did
end
in
peace
and
the
seventy
and
seventh
year
began
in
peace
and
the
church
did
spread
throughout
the
face
of
all
the
land
and
the
more
part
of
the
people
both
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites
did
belong
to
the
church
and
they
did
have
exceedingly
great
peace
in
the
land
and
thus
ended
the
seventy
and
seventh
year

and
also
they
had
peace
in
the
seventy
and
eighth
year
save
it
were
a
few
contentions
concerning
the
points
of
doctrine
which
had
been
laid
down
by
the
prophets

and
in
the
seventy
and
ninth
year
there
began
to
be
much
strife
but
it
came
to
pass
that
nephi
and
lehi
and
many
of
their
brethren
who
knew
concerning
the
true
points
of
doctrine
having
many
revelations
daily
therefore
they
did
preach
unto
the
people
insomuch
that
they
did
put
an
end
to
their
strife
in
that
same
year

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
eightieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
there
were
a
certain
number
of
the
dissenters
from
the
people
of
nephi
who
had
some
years
before
gone
over
unto
the
lamanites
and
taken
upon
themselves
the
name
of
lamanites
and
also
a
certain
number
who
were
real
descendants
of
the
lamanites
being
stirred
up
to
anger
by
them
or
by
those
dissenters
therefore
they
commenced
a
war
with
their
brethren

and
they
did
commit
murder
and
plunder
and
then
they
would
retreat
back
into
the
mountains
and
into
the
wilderness
and
secret
places
hiding
themselves
that
they
could
not
be
discovered
receiving
daily
an
addition
to
their
numbers
inasmuch
as
there
were
dissenters
that
went
forth
unto
them

and
thus
in
time
yea
even
in
the
space
of
not
many
years
they
became
an
exceedingly
great
band
of
robbers
and
they
did
search
out
all
the
secret
plans
of
gadianton
and
thus
they
became
robbers
of
gadianton

now
behold
these
robbers
did
make
great
havoc
yea
even
great
destruction
among
the
people
of
nephi
and
also
among
the
people
of
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
it
was
expedient
that
there
should
be
a
stop
put
to
this
work
of
destruction
therefore
they
sent
an
army
of
strong
men
into
the
wilderness
and
upon
the
mountains
to
search
out
this
band
of
robbers
and
to
destroy
them

but
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
in
that
same
year
they
were
driven
back
even
into
their
own
lands
and
thus
ended
the
eightieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
eighty
and
first
year
they
did
go
forth
again
against
this
band
of
robbers
and
did
destroy
many
and
they
were
also
visited
with
much
destruction

and
they
were
again
obliged
to
return
out
of
the
wilderness
and
out
of
the
mountains
unto
their
own
lands
because
of
the
exceeding
greatness
of
the
numbers
of
those
robbers
who
infested
the
mountains
and
the
wilderness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
ended
this
year
and
the
robbers
did
still
increase
and
wax
strong
insomuch
that
they
did
defy
the
whole
armies
of
the
nephites
and
also
of
the
lamanites
and
they
did
cause
great
fear
to
come
unto
the
people
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land

yea
for
they
did
visit
many
parts
of
the
land
and
did
do
great
destruction
unto
them
yea
did
kill
many
and
did
carry
away
others
captive
into
the
wilderness
yea
and
more
especially
their
women
and
their
children

now
this
great
evil
which
came
unto
the
people
because
of
their
iniquity
did
stir
them
up
again
in
remembrance
of
the
lord
their
god

and
thus
ended
the
eighty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges

and
in
the
eighty
and
second
year
they
began
again
to
forget
the
lord
their
god
and
in
the
eighty
and
third
year
they
began
to
wax
strong
in
iniquity
and
in
the
eighty
and
fourth
year
they
did
not
mend
their
ways

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eighty
and
fifth
year
they
did
wax
stronger
and
stronger
in
their
pride
and
in
their
wickedness
and
thus
they
were
ripening
again
for
destruction

and
thus
ended
the
eighty
and
fifth
year

chapter


and
thus
we
can
behold
how
false
and
also
the
unsteadiness
of
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
yea
we
can
see
that
the
lord
in
his
great
infinite
goodness
doth
bless
and
prosper
those
who
put
their
trust
in
him

yea
and
we
may
see
at
the
very
time
when
he
doth
prosper
his
people
yea
in
the
increase
of
their
fields
their
flocks
and
their
herds
and
in
gold
and
in
silver
and
in
all
manner
of
precious
things
of
every
kind
and
art
sparing
their
lives
and
delivering
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
softening
the
hearts
of
their
enemies
that
they
should
not
declare
wars
against
them
yea
and
in
fine
doing
all
things
for
the
welfare
and
happiness
of
his
people
yea
then
is
the
time
that
they
do
harden
their
hearts
and
do
forget
the
lord
their
god
and
do
trample
under
their
feet
the
holy
oneyea
and
this
because
of
their
ease
and
their
exceedingly
great
prosperity

and
thus
we
see
that
except
the
lord
doth
chasten
his
people
with
many
afflictions
yea
except
he
doth
visit
them
with
death
and
with
terror
and
with
famine
and
with
all
manner
of
pestilence
they
will
not
remember
him

o
how
foolish
and
how
vain
and
how
evil
and
devilish
and
how
quick
to
do
iniquity
and
how
slow
to
do
good
are
the
children
of
men
yea
how
quick
to
hearken
unto
the
words
of
the
evil
one
and
to
set
their
hearts
upon
the
vain
things
of
the
world

yea
how
quick
to
be
lifted
up
in
pride
yea
how
quick
to
boast
and
do
all
manner
of
that
which
is
iniquity
and
how
slow
are
they
to
remember
the
lord
their
god
and
to
give
ear
unto
his
counsels
yea
how
slow
to
walk
in
wisdoms
paths

behold
they
do
not
desire
that
the
lord
their
god
who
hath
created
them
should
rule
and
reign
over
them
notwithstanding
his
great
goodness
and
his
mercy
towards
them
they
do
set
at
naught
his
counsels
and
they
will
not
that
he
should
be
their
guide

o
how
great
is
the
nothingness
of
the
children
of
men
yea
even
they
are
less
than
the
dust
of
the
earth

for
behold
the
dust
of
the
earth
moveth
hither
and
thither
to
the
dividing
asunder
at
the
command
of
our
great
and
everlasting
god

yea
behold
at
his
voice
do
the
hills
and
the
mountains
tremble
and
quake

and
by
the
power
of
his
voice
they
are
broken
up
and
become
smooth
yea
even
like
unto
a
valley

yea
by
the
power
of
his
voice
doth
the
whole
earth
shake

yea
by
the
power
of
his
voice
do
the
foundations
rock
even
to
the
very
center

yea
and
if
he
say
unto
the
earthmoveit
is
moved

yea
if
he
say
unto
the
earththou
shalt
go
back
that
it
lengthen
out
the
day
for
many
hoursit
is
done

and
thus
according
to
his
word
the
earth
goeth
back
and
it
appeareth
unto
man
that
the
sun
standeth
still
yea
and
behold
this
is
so
for
surely
it
is
the
earth
that
moveth
and
not
the
sun

and
behold
also
if
he
say
unto
the
waters
of
the
great
deepbe
thou
dried
upit
is
done

behold
if
he
say
unto
this
mountainbe
thou
raised
up
and
come
over
and
fall
upon
that
city
that
it
be
buried
upbehold
it
is
done

and
behold
if
a
man
hide
up
a
treasure
in
the
earth
and
the
lord
shall
saylet
it
be
accursed
because
of
the
iniquity
of
him
who
hath
hid
it
upbehold
it
shall
be
accursed

and
if
the
lord
shall
saybe
thou
accursed
that
no
man
shall
find
thee
from
this
time
henceforth
and
foreverbehold
no
man
getteth
it
henceforth
and
forever

and
behold
if
the
lord
shall
say
unto
a
manbecause
of
thine
iniquities
thou
shalt
be
accursed
foreverit
shall
be
done

and
if
the
lord
shall
saybecause
of
thine
iniquities
thou
shalt
be
cut
off
from
my
presencehe
will
cause
that
it
shall
be
so

and
wo
unto
him
to
whom
he
shall
say
this
for
it
shall
be
unto
him
that
will
do
iniquity
and
he
cannot
be
saved
therefore
for
this
cause
that
men
might
be
saved
hath
repentance
been
declared

therefore
blessed
are
they
who
will
repent
and
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
lord
their
god
for
these
are
they
that
shall
be
saved

and
may
god
grant
in
his
great
fulness
that
men
might
be
brought
unto
repentance
and
good
works
that
they
might
be
restored
unto
grace
for
grace
according
to
their
works

and
i
would
that
all
men
might
be
saved
but
we
read
that
in
the
great
and
last
day
there
are
some
who
shall
be
cast
out
yea
who
shall
be
cast
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord

yea
who
shall
be
consigned
to
a
state
of
endless
misery
fulfilling
the
words
which
say
they
that
have
done
good
shall
have
everlasting
life
and
they
that
have
done
evil
shall
have
everlasting
damnation
and
thus
it
is
amen

chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eighty
and
sixth
year
the
nephites
did
still
remain
in
wickedness
yea
in
great
wickedness
while
the
lamanites
did
observe
strictly
to
keep
the
commandments
of
god
according
to
the
law
of
moses

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
year
there
was
one
samuel
a
lamanite
came
into
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
began
to
preach
unto
the
people
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
preach
many
days
repentance
unto
the
people
and
they
did
cast
him
out
and
he
was
about
to
return
to
his
own
land

but
behold
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
unto
him
that
he
should
return
again
and
prophesy
unto
the
people
whatsoever
things
should
come
into
his
heart

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
would
not
suffer
that
he
should
enter
into
the
city
therefore
he
went
and
got
upon
the
wall
thereof
and
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
and
prophesied
unto
the
people
whatsoever
things
the
lord
put
into
his
heart

and
he
said
unto
them
behold
i
samuel
a
lamanite
do
speak
the
words
of
the
lord
which
he
doth
put
into
my
heart
and
behold
he
hath
put
it
into
my
heart
to
say
unto
this
people
that
the
sword
of
justice
hangeth
over
this
people
and
four
hundred
years
pass
not
away
save
the
sword
of
justice
falleth
upon
this
people

yea
heavy
destruction
awaiteth
this
people
and
it
surely
cometh
unto
this
people
and
nothing
can
save
this
people
save
it
be
repentance
and
faith
on
the
lord
jesus
christ
who
surely
shall
come
into
the
world
and
shall
suffer
many
things
and
shall
be
slain
for
his
people

and
behold
an
angel
of
the
lord
hath
declared
it
unto
me
and
he
did
bring
glad
tidings
to
my
soul
and
behold
i
was
sent
unto
you
to
declare
it
unto
you
also
that
ye
might
have
glad
tidings
but
behold
ye
would
not
receive
me

therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
because
of
the
hardness
of
the
hearts
of
the
people
of
the
nephites
except
they
repent
i
will
take
away
my
word
from
them
and
i
will
withdraw
my
spirit
from
them
and
i
will
suffer
them
no
longer
and
i
will
turn
the
hearts
of
their
brethren
against
them

and
four
hundred
years
shall
not
pass
away
before
i
will
cause
that
they
shall
be
smitten
yea
i
will
visit
them
with
the
sword
and
with
famine
and
with
pestilence

yea
i
will
visit
them
in
my
fierce
anger
and
there
shall
be
those
of
the
fourth
generation
who
shall
live
of
your
enemies
to
behold
your
utter
destruction
and
this
shall
surely
come
except
ye
repent
saith
the
lord
and
those
of
the
fourth
generation
shall
visit
your
destruction

but
if
ye
will
repent
and
return
unto
the
lord
your
god
i
will
turn
away
mine
anger
saith
the
lord
yea
thus
saith
the
lord
blessed
are
they
who
will
repent
and
turn
unto
me
but
wo
unto
him
that
repenteth
not

yea
wo
unto
this
great
city
of
zarahemla
for
behold
it
is
because
of
those
who
are
righteous
that
it
is
saved
yea
wo
unto
this
great
city
for
i
perceive
saith
the
lord
that
there
are
many
yea
even
the
more
part
of
this
great
city
that
will
harden
their
hearts
against
me
saith
the
lord

but
blessed
are
they
who
will
repent
for
them
will
i
spare
but
behold
if
it
were
not
for
the
righteous
who
are
in
this
great
city
behold
i
would
cause
that
fire
should
come
down
out
of
heaven
and
destroy
it

but
behold
it
is
for
the
righteous
sake
that
it
is
spared
but
behold
the
time
cometh
saith
the
lord
that
when
ye
shall
cast
out
the
righteous
from
among
you
then
shall
ye
be
ripe
for
destruction
yea
wo
be
unto
this
great
city
because
of
the
wickedness
and
abominations
which
are
in
her

yea
and
wo
be
unto
the
city
of
gideon
for
the
wickedness
and
abominations
which
are
in
her

yea
and
wo
be
unto
all
the
cities
which
are
in
the

because
of
the
peoples
sake
who
are
upon

because
of
their
wickedness

their

it
shall
come

saith
the
lord
of

our
great
and
true
god
that
whoso

hide
up
treasures
in

earth
shall
find
them
again
no

of
the
great
curse
of

he
be
a
righteous
man
and

the
day

behold
ye
the
people
of
this
great
city
and
hearken
unto
my
words
yea
hearken
unto
the
words
which
the
lord
saith
for
behold
he
saith
that
ye
are
cursed
because
of
your
riches
and
also
are
your
riches
cursed
because
ye
have
set
your
hearts
upon
them
and
have
not
hearkened
unto
the
words
of
him
who
gave
them
unto
you

ye
do
not
remember
the
lord
your
god
in
the
things
with
which
he
hath
blessed
you
but
ye
do
always
remember
your
riches
not
to
thank
the
lord
your
god
for
them
yea
your
hearts
are
not
drawn
out
unto
the
lord
but
they
do
swell
with
great
pride
unto
boasting
and
unto
great
swelling
envyings
strifes
malice
persecutions
and
murders
and
all
manner
of
iniquities

for
this
cause
hath
the
lord
god
caused
that
a
curse
should
come
upon
the
land
and
also
upon
your
riches
and
this
because
of
your
iniquities

yea
wo
unto
this
people
because
of
this
time
which
has
arrived
that
ye
do
cast
out
the
prophets
and
do
mock
them
and
cast
stones
at
them
and
do
slay
them
and
do
all
manner
of
iniquity
unto
them
even
as
they
did
of
old
time

and
now
when
ye
talk
ye
say
if
our
days
had
been
in
the
days
of
our
fathers
of
old
we
would
not
have
slain
the
prophets
we
would
not
have
stoned
them
and
cast
them
out

behold
ye
are
worse
than
they
for
as
the
lord
liveth
if
a
prophet
come
among
you
and
declareth
unto
you
the
word
of
the
lord
which
testifieth
of
your
sins
and
iniquities
ye
are
angry
with
him
and
cast
him
out
and
seek
all
manner
of
ways
to
destroy
him
yea
you
will
say
that
he
is
a
false
prophet
and
that
he
is
a
sinner
and
of
the
devil
because
he
testifieth
that
your
deeds
are
evil

but
behold
if
a
man
shall
come
among
you
and
shall
say
do
this
and
there
is
no
iniquity
do
that
and
ye
shall
not
suffer
yea
he
will
say
walk
after
the
pride
of
your
own
hearts
yea
walk
after
the
pride
of
your
eyes
and
do
whatsoever
your
heart
desirethand
if
a
man
shall
come
among
you
and
say
this
ye
will
receive
him
and
say
that
he
is
a
prophet

yea
ye
will
lift
him
up
and
ye
will
give
unto
him
of
your
substance
ye
will
give
unto
him
of
your
gold
and
of
your
silver
and
ye
will
clothe
him
with
costly
apparel
and
because
he
speaketh
flattering
words
unto
you
and
he
saith
that
all
is
well
then
ye
will
not
find
fault
with
him

o
ye
wicked
and
ye
perverse
generation
ye
hardened
and
ye
stiffnecked
people
how
long
will
ye
suppose
that
the
lord
will
suffer
you
yea
how
long
will
ye
suffer
yourselves
to
be
led
by
foolish
and
blind
guides
yea
how
long
will
ye
choose
darkness
rather
than
light

yea
behold
the
anger
of
the
lord
is
already
kindled
against
you
behold
he
hath
cursed
the
land
because
of
your
iniquity

and
behold
the
time
cometh
that
he
curseth
your
riches
that
they
become
slippery
that
ye
cannot
hold
them
and
in
the
days
of
your
poverty
ye
cannot
retain
them

and
in
the
days
of
your
poverty
ye
shall
cry
unto
the
lord
and
in
vain
shall
ye
cry
for
your
desolation
is
already
come
upon
you
and
your
destruction
is
made
sure
and
then
shall
ye
weep
and
howl
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
and
then
shall
ye
lament
and
say

o
that
i
had
repented
and
had
not
killed
the
prophets
and
stoned
them
and
cast
them
out
yea
in
that
day
ye
shall
say
o
that
we
had
remembered
the
lord
our
god
in
the
day
that
he
gave
us
our
riches
and
then
they
would
not
have
become
slippery
that
we
should
lose
them
for
behold
our
riches
are
gone
from
us

behold
we
lay
a
tool
here
and
on
the
morrow
it
is
gone
and
behold
our
swords
are
taken
from
us
in
the
day
we
have
sought
them
for
battle

yea
we
have
hid
up
our
treasures
and
they
have
slipped
away
from
us
because
of
the
curse
of
the
land

o
that
we
had
repented
in
the
day
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
us
for
behold
the
land
is
cursed
and
all
things
are
become
slippery
and
we
cannot
hold
them

behold
we
are
surrounded
by
demons
yea
we
are
encircled
about
by
the
angels
of
him
who
hath
sought
to
destroy
our
souls
behold
our
iniquities
are
great
o
lord
canst
thou
not
turn
away
thine
anger
from
us
and
this
shall
be
your
language
in
those
days

but
behold
your
days
of
probation
are
past
ye
have
procrastinated
the
day
of
your
salvation
until
it
is
everlastingly
too
late
and
your
destruction
is
made
sure
yea
for
ye
have
sought
all
the
days
of
your
lives
for
that
which
ye
could
not
obtain
and
ye
have
sought
for
happiness
in
doing
iniquity
which
thing
is
contrary
to
the
nature
of
that
righteousness
which
is
in
our
great
and
eternal
head

o
ye
people
of
the
land
that
ye
would
hear
my
words
and
i
pray
that
the
anger
of
the
lord
be
turned
away
from
you
and
that
ye
would
repent
and
be
saved

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
samuel
the
lamanite
did
prophesy
a
great
many
more
things
which
cannot
be
written

and
behold
he
said
unto
them
behold
i
give
unto
you
a
sign
for
five
years
more
cometh
and
behold
then
cometh
the
son
of
god
to
redeem
all
those
who
shall
believe
on
his
name

and
behold
this
will
i
give
unto
you
for
a
sign
at
the
time
of
his
coming
for
behold
there
shall
be
great
lights
in
heaven
insomuch
that
in
the
night
before
he
cometh
there
shall
be
no
darkness
insomuch
that
it
shall
appear
unto
man
as
if
it
was
day

therefore
there
shall
be
one
day
and
a
night
and
a
day
as
if
it
were
one
day
and
there
were
no
night
and
this
shall
be
unto
you
for
a
sign
for
ye
shall
know
of
the
rising
of
the
sun
and
also
of
its
setting
therefore
they
shall
know
of
a
surety
that
there
shall
be
two
days
and
a
night
nevertheless
the
night
shall
not
be
darkened
and
it
shall
be
the
night
before
he
is
born

and
behold
there
shall
a
new
star
arise
such
an
one
as
ye
never
have
beheld
and
this
also
shall
be
a
sign
unto
you

and
behold
this
is
not
all
there
shall
be
many
signs
and
wonders
in
heaven

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
ye
shall
all
be
amazed
and
wonder
insomuch
that
ye
shall
fall
to
the
earth

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whosoever
shall
believe
on
the
son
of
god
the
same
shall
have
everlasting
life

and
behold
thus
hath
the
lord
commanded
me
by
his
angel
that
i
should
come
and
tell
this
thing
unto
you
yea
he
hath
commanded
that
i
should
prophesy
these
things
unto
you
yea
he
hath
said
unto
me
cry
unto
this
people
repent
and
prepare
the
way
of
the
lord

and
now
because
i
am
a
lamanite
and
have
spoken
unto
you
the
words
which
the
lord
hath
commanded
me
and
because
it
was
hard
against
you
ye
are
angry
with
me
and
do
seek
to
destroy
me
and
have
cast
me
out
from
among
you

and
ye
shall
hear
my
words
for
for
this
intent
have
i
come
up
upon
the
walls
of
this
city
that
ye
might
hear
and
know
of
the
judgments
of
god
which
do
await
you
because
of
your
iniquities
and
also
that
ye
might
know
the
conditions
of
repentance

and
also
that
ye
might
know
of
the
coming
of
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
the
father
of
heaven
and
of
earth
the
creator
of
all
things
from
the

and
that
ye
might
know
of
the
signs
of
his
coming
to
the
intent
that
ye
might
believe
on
his
name

and
if
ye
believe
on
his
name
ye
will
repent
of
all
your
sins
that
thereby
ye
may
have
a
remission
of
them
through
his
merits

and
behold
again
another
sign
i
give
unto
you
yea
a
sign
of
his
death

for
behold
he
surely
must
die
that
salvation
may
come
yea
it
behooveth
him
and
becometh
expedient
that
he
dieth
to
bring
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
that
thereby
men
may
be
brought
into
the
presence
of
the
lord

yea
behold
this
death
bringeth
to
pass
the
resurrection
and
redeemeth
all
mankind
from
the
first
deaththat
spiritual
death
for
all
mankind
by
the
fall
of
adam

cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
are
considered
as
dead
both
as
to
things
temporal
and
to
things
spiritual

but
behold
the
resurrection
of
christ
redeemeth
mankind
yea
even
all
mankind
and
bringeth
them
back
into
the
presence
of
the
lord

yea
and
it
bringeth
to
pass
the
condition
of
repentance
that
whosoever
repenteth
the
same
is
not
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
but
whosoever
repenteth
not
is
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
and
there
cometh
upon
them
again
a
spiritual
death
yea
a
second
death
for
they
are
cut
off
again
as
to
things
pertaining
to
righteousness

therefore
repent
ye
repent
ye
lest
by
knowing
these
things
and
not
doing
them
ye
shall
suffer
yourselves
to
come
under
condemnation
and
ye
are
brought
down
unto
this
second
death

but
behold
as
i
said
unto
you
concerning
another
sign
a
sign
of
his
death
behold
in
that
day
that
he
shall
suffer
death
the
sun
shall
be
darkened
and
refuse
to
give
his
light
unto
you
and
also
the
moon
and
the
stars
and
there
shall
be
no
light
upon
the
face
of
this
land
even
from
the
time
that
he
shall
suffer
death
for
the
space
of
three
days
to
the
time
that
he
shall
rise
again
from
the
dead

yea
at
the
time
that
he
shall
yield
up
the
ghost
there
shall
be
thunderings
and
lightnings
for
the
space
of
many
hours
and
the
earth
shall
shake
and
tremble
and
the
rocks
which
are
upon
the
face
of
this
earth
which
are
both
above
the
earth
and
beneath
which
ye
know
at
this
time
are
solid
or
the
more
part
of
it
is
one
solid
mass
shall
be
broken
up

yea
they
shall
be
rent
in
twain
and
shall
ever
after
be
found
in
seams
and
in
cracks
and
in
broken
fragments
upon
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
yea
both
above
the
earth
and
beneath

and
behold
there
shall
be
great
tempests
and
there
shall
be
many
mountains
laid
low
like
unto
a
valley
and
there
shall
be
many
places
which
are
now
called
valleys
which
shall
become
mountains
whose
height
is
great

and
many
highways
shall
be
broken
up
and
many
cities
shall
become
desolate

and
many
graves
shall
be
opened
and
shall
yield
up
many
of
their
dead
and
many
saints
shall
appear
unto
many

and
behold
thus
hath
the
angel
spoken
unto
me
for
he
said
unto
me
that
there
should
be
thunderings
and
lightnings
for
the
space
of
many
hours

and
he
said
unto
me
that
while
the
thunder
and
the
lightning
lasted
and
the
tempest
that
these
things
should
be
and
that
darkness
should
cover
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
for
the
space
of
three
days

and
the
angel
said
unto
me
that
many
shall
see
greater
things
than
these
to
the
intent
that
they
might
believe
that
these
signs
and
these
wonders
should
come
to
pass
upon
all
the
face
of
this
land
to
the
intent
that
there
should
be
no
cause
for
unbelief
among
the
children
of
men

and
this
to
the
intent
that
whosoever
will
believe
might
be
saved
and
that
whosoever
will
not
believe
a
righteous
judgment
might
come
upon
them
and
also
if
they
are
condemned
they
bring
upon
themselves
their
own
condemnation

and
now
remember
remember
my
brethren
that
whosoever
perisheth
perisheth
unto
himself
and
whosoever
doeth
iniquity
doeth
it
unto
himself
for
behold
ye
are
free
ye
are
permitted
to
act
for
yourselves
for
behold
god
hath
given
unto
you
a
knowledge
and
he
hath
made
you
free

he
hath
given
unto
you
that
ye
might
know
good
from
evil
and
he
hath
given
unto
you
that
ye
might
choose
life
or
death
and
ye
can
do
good
and
be
restored
unto
that
which
is
good
or
have
that
which
is
good
restored
unto
you
or
ye
can
do
evil
and
have
that
which
is
evil
restored
unto
you

and
now
my
beloved
brethren
behold
i
declare
unto
you
that
except
ye
shall
repent
your
houses
shall
be
left
unto
you
desolate

yea
except
ye
repent
your
women
shall
have
great
cause
to
mourn
in
the
day
that
they
shall
give
suck
for
ye
shall
attempt
to
flee
and
there
shall
be
no
place
for
refuge
yea
and
wo
unto
them
which
are
with
child
for
they
shall
be
heavy
and
cannot
flee
therefore
they
shall
be
trodden
down
and
shall
be
left
to
perish

yea
wo
unto
this
people
who
are
called
the
people
of
nephi
except
they
shall
repent
when
they
shall
see
all
these
signs
and
wonders
which
shall
be
showed
unto
them
for
behold
they
have
been
a
chosen
people
of
the
lord
yea
the
people
of
nephi
hath
he
loved
and
also
hath
he
chastened
them
yea
in
the
days
of
their
iniquities
hath
he
chastened
them
because
he
loveth
them

but
behold
my
brethren
the
lamanites
hath
he
hated
because
their
deeds
have
been
evil
continually
and
this
because
of
the
iniquity
of
the
tradition
of
their
fathers
but
behold
salvation
hath
come
unto
them
through
the
preaching
of
the
nephites
and
for
this
intent
hath
the
lord
prolonged
their
days

and
i
would
that
ye
should
behold
that
the
more
part
of
them
are
in
the
path
of
their
duty
and
they
do
walk
circumspectly
before
god
and
they
do
observe
to
keep
his
commandments
and
his
statutes
and
his
judgments
according
to
the
law
of
moses

yea
i
say
unto
you
that
the
more
part
of
them
are
doing
this
and
they
are
striving
with
unwearied
diligence
that
they
may
bring
the
remainder
of
their
brethren
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
therefore
there
are
many
who
do
add
to
their
numbers
daily

and
behold
ye
do
know
of
yourselves
for
ye
have
witnessed
it
that
as
many
of
them
as
are
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
and
to
know
of
the
wicked
and
abominable
traditions
of
their
fathers
and
are
led
to
believe
the
holy
scriptures
yea
the
prophecies
of
the
holy
prophets
which
are
written
which
leadeth
them
to
faith
on
the
lord
and
unto
repentance
which
faith
and
repentance
bringeth
a
change
of
heart
unto
them

therefore
as
many
as
have
come
to
this
ye
know
of
yourselves
are
firm
and
steadfast
in
the
faith
and
in
the
thing
wherewith
they
have
been
made
free

and
ye
know
also
that
they
have
buried
their
weapons
of
war
and
they
fear
to
take
them
up
lest
by
any
means
they
should
sin
yea
ye
can
see
that
they
fear
to
sinfor
behold
they
will
suffer
themselves
that
they
be
trodden
down
and
slain
by
their
enemies
and
will
not
lift
their
swords
against
them
and
this
because
of
their
faith
in
christ

and
now
because
of
their
steadfastness
when
they
do
believe
in
that
thing
which
they
do
believe
for
because
of
their
firmness
when
they
are
once
enlightened
behold
the
lord
shall
bless
them
and
prolong
their
days
notwithstanding
their
iniquity

yea
even
if
they
should
dwindle
in
unbelief
the
lord
shall
prolong
their
days
until
the
time
shall
come
which
hath
been
spoken
of
by
our
fathers
and
also
by
the
prophet
zenos
and
many
other
prophets
concerning
the
restoration
of
our
brethren
the
lamanites
again
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth

yea
i
say
unto
you
that
in
the
latter
times
the
promises
of
the
lord
have
been
extended
to
our
brethren
the
lamanites
and
notwithstanding
the
many
afflictions
which
they
shall
have
and
notwithstanding
they
shall
be
driven
to
and
fro
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
be
hunted
and
shall
be
smitten
and
scattered
abroad
having
no
place
for
refuge
the
lord
shall
be
merciful
unto
them

and
this
is
according
to
the
prophecy
that
they
shall
again
be
brought
to
the
true
knowledge
which
is
knowledge
of
their
redeemer
and
their
great
and
true
shepherd
and
be
numbered
among
his
sheep

therefore
i
say
unto
you
it
shall
be
better
for
them
than
for
you
except
ye
repent

for
behold
had
the
mighty
works
been
shown
unto
them
which
have
been
shown
unto
you
yea
unto
them
who
have
dwindled
in
unbelief
because
of
the
traditions
of
their
fathers
ye
can
see
of
yourselves
that
they
never
would
again
have
dwindled
in
unbelief

therefore
saith
the
lord
i
will
not
utterly
destroy
them
but
i
will
cause
that
in
the
day
of
my
wisdom
they
shall
return
again
unto
me
saith
the
lord

and
now
behold
saith
the
lord
concerning
the
people
of
the
nephites
if
they
will
not
repent
and
observe
to
do
my
will
i
will
utterly
destroy
them
saith
the
lord
because
of
their
unbelief
notwithstanding
the
many
mighty
works
which
i
have
done
among
them
and
as
surely
as
the
lord
liveth
shall
these
things
be
saith
the
lord
helaman
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
who
heard
the
words
of
samuel
the
lamanite
which
he
spake
upon
the
walls
of
the
city
and
as
many
as
believed
on
his
word
went
forth
and
sought
for
nephi
and
when
they
had
come
forth
and
found
him
they
confessed
unto
him
their
sins
and
denied
not
desiring
that
they
might
be
baptized
unto
the
lord

but
as
many
as
there
were
who
did
not
believe
in
the
words
of
samuel
were
angry
with
him
and
they
cast
stones
at
him
upon
the
wall
and
also
many
shot
arrows
at
him
as
he
stood
upon
the
wall
but
the
spirit
of
the
lord
was
with
him
insomuch
that
they
could
not
hit
him
with
their
stones
neither
with
their
arrows

now
when
they
saw
that
they
could
not
hit
him
there
were
many
more
who
did
believe
on
his
words
insomuch
that
they
went
away
unto
nephi
to
be
baptized

for
behold
nephi
was
baptizing
and
prophesying
and
preaching
crying
repentance
unto
the
people
showing
signs
and
wonders
working
miracles
among
the
people
that
they
might
know
that
the
christ
must
shortly
come

telling
them
of
things
which
must
shortly
come
that
they
might
know
and
remember
at
the
time
of
their
coming
that
they
had
been
made
known
unto
them
beforehand
to
the
intent
that
they
might
believe
therefore
as
many
as
believed
on
the
words
of
samuel
went
forth
unto
him
to
be
baptized
for
they
came
repenting
and
confessing
their
sins

but
the
more
part
of
them
did
not
believe
in
the
words
of
samuel
therefore
when
they
saw
that
they
could
not
hit
him
with
their
stones
and
their
arrows
they
cried
unto
their
captains
saying
take
this
fellow
and
bind
him
for
behold
he
hath
a
devil
and
because
of
the
power
of
the
devil
which
is
in
him
we
cannot
hit
him
with
our
stones
and
our
arrows
therefore
take
him
and
bind
him
and
away
with
him

and
as
they
went
forth
to
lay
their
hands
on
him
behold
he
did
cast
himself
down
from
the
wall
and
did
flee
out
of
their
lands
yea
even
unto
his
own
country
and
began
to
preach
and
to
prophesy
among
his
own
people

and
behold
he
was
never
heard
of
more
among
the
nephites
and
thus
were
the
affairs
of
the
people

and
thus
ended
the
eighty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi

and
thus
ended
also
the
eighty
and
seventh
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
the
more
part
of
the
people
remaining
in
their
pride
and
wickedness
and
the
lesser
part
walking
more
circumspectly
before
god

and
these
were
the
conditions
also
in
the
eighty
and
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges

and
there
was
but
little
alteration
in
the
affairs
of
the
people
save
it
were
the
people
began
to
be
more
hardened
in
iniquity
and
do
more
and
more
of
that
which
was
contrary
to
the
commandments
of
god
in
the
eighty
and
ninth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges

but
it
came
to
pass
in
the
ninetieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
there
were
great
signs
given
unto
the
people
and
wonders
and
the
words
of
the
prophets
began
to
be
fulfilled

and
angels
did
appear
unto
men
wise
men
and
did
declare
unto
them
glad
tidings
of
great
joy
thus
in
this
year
the
scriptures
began
to
be
fulfilled

nevertheless
the
people
began
to
harden
their
hearts
all
save
it
were
the
most
believing
part
of
them
both
of
the
nephites
and
also
of
the
lamanites
and
began
to
depend
upon
their
own
strength
and
upon
their
own
wisdom
saying

some
things
they
may
have
guessed
right
among
so
many
but
behold
we
know
that
all
these
great
and
marvelous
works
cannot
come
to
pass
of
which
has
been
spoken

and
they
began
to
reason
and
to
contend
among
themselves
saying

that
it
is
not
reasonable
that
such
a
being
as
a
christ
shall
come
if
so
and
he
be
the
son
of
god
the
father
of
heaven
and
of
earth
as
it
has
been
spoken
why
will
he
not
show
himself
unto
us
as
well
as
unto
them
who
shall
be
at
jerusalem

yea
why
will
he
not
show
himself
in
this
land
as
well
as
in
the
land
of
jerusalem

but
behold
we
know
that
this
is
a
wicked
tradition
which
has
been
handed
down
unto
us
by
our
fathers
to
cause
us
that
we
should
believe
in
some
great
and
marvelous
thing
which
should
come
to
pass
but
not
among
us
but
in
a
land
which
is
far
distant
a
land
which
we
know
not
therefore
they
can
keep
us
in
ignorance
for
we
cannot
witness
with
our
own
eyes
that
they
are
true

and
they
will
by
the
cunning
and
the
mysterious
arts
of
the
evil
one
work
some
great
mystery
which
we
cannot
understand
which
will
keep
us
down
to
be
servants
to
their
words
and
also
servants
unto
them
for
we
depend
upon
them
to
teach
us
the
word
and
thus
will
they
keep
us
in
ignorance
if
we
will
yield
ourselves
unto
them
all
the
days
of
our
lives

and
many
more
things
did
the
people
imagine
up
in
their
hearts
which
were
foolish
and
vain
and
they
were
much
disturbed
for
satan
did
stir
them
up
to
do
iniquity
continually
yea
he
did
go
about
spreading
rumors
and
contentions
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
that
he
might
harden
the
hearts
of
the
people
against
that
which
was
good
and
against
that
which
should
come

and
notwithstanding
the
signs
and
the
wonders
which
were
wrought
among
the
people
of
the
lord
and
the
many
miracles
which
they
did
satan
did
get
great
hold
upon
the
hearts
of
the
people
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land

and
thus
ended
the
ninetieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi

and
thus
ended
the
book
of
helaman
according
to
the
record
of
helaman
and
his
sons
third
book
of
nephi
the
son
of
nephi
who
was
the
son
of
helaman
and
helaman
was
the
son
of
helaman
who
was
the
son
of
alma
who
was
the
son
of
alma
being
a
descendant
of
nephi
who
was
the
son
of
lehi
who
came
out
of
jerusalem
in
the
first
year
of
the
reign
of
zedekiah
the
king
of

nephi
chapter


now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
ninety
and
first
year
had
passed
away
and
it
was
six
hundred
years
from
the
time
that
lehi
left
jerusalem
and
it
was
in
the
year
that
lachoneus
was
the
chief
judge
and
the
governor
over
the
land

and
nephi
the
son
of
helaman
had
departed
out
of
the
land
of
zarahemla
giving
charge
unto
his
son
nephi
who
was
his
eldest
son
concerning
the
plates
of
brass
and
all
the
records
which
had
been
kept
and
all
those
things
which
had
been
kept
sacred
from
the
departure
of
lehi
out
of
jerusalem

then
he
departed
out
of
the
land
and
whither
he
went
no
man
knoweth
and
his
son
nephi
did
keep
the
records
in
his
stead
yea
the
record
of
this
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
commencement
of
the
ninety
and
second
year
behold
the
prophecies
of
the
prophets
began
to
be
fulfilled
more
fully
for
there
began
to
be
greater
signs
and
greater
miracles
wrought
among
the
people

but
there
were
some
who
began
to
say
that
the
time
was
past
for
the
words
to
be
fulfilled
which
were
spoken
by
samuel
the
lamanite

and
they
began
to
rejoice
over
their
brethren
saying
behold
the
time
is
past
and
the
words
of
samuel
are
not
fulfilled
therefore
your
joy
and
your
faith
concerning
this
thing
hath
been
vain

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
make
a
great
uproar
throughout
the
land
and
the
people
who
believed
began
to
be
very
sorrowful
lest
by
any
means
those
things
which
had
been
spoken
might
not
come
to
pass

but
behold
they
did
watch
steadfastly
for
that
day
and
that
night
and
that
day
which
should
be
as
one
day
as
if
there
were
no
night
that
they
might
know
that
their
faith
had
not
been
vain

now
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
a
day
set
apart
by
the
unbelievers
that
all
those
who
believed
in
those
traditions
should
be
put
to
death
except
the
sign
should
come
to
pass
which
had
been
given
by
samuel
the
prophet

now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
nephi
the
son
of
nephi
saw
this
wickedness
of
his
people
his
heart
was
exceedingly
sorrowful

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
went
out
and
bowed
himself
down
upon
the
earth
and
cried
mightily
to
his
god
in
behalf
of
his
people
yea
those
who
were
about
to
be
destroyed
because
of
their
faith
in
the
tradition
of
their
fathers

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
cried
mightily
unto
the
lord
all
that
day
and
behold
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
unto
him
saying

lift
up
your
head
and
be
of
good
cheer
for
behold
the
time
is
at
hand
and
on
this
night
shall
the
sign
be
given
and
on
the
morrow
come
i
into
the
world
to
show
unto
the
world
that
i
will
fulfill
all
that
which
i
have
caused
to
be
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
my
holy
prophets

behold
i
come
unto
my
own
to
fulfill
all
things
which
i
have
made
known
unto
the
children
of
men
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
and
to
do
the
will
both
of
the
father
and
of
the
sonof
the
father
because
of
me
and
of
the
son
because
of
my
flesh
and
behold
the
time
is
at
hand
and
this
night
shall
the
sign
be
given

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
words
which
came
unto
nephi
were
fulfilled
according
as
they
had
been
spoken
for
behold
at
the
going
down
of
the
sun
there
was
no
darkness
and
the
people
began
to
be
astonished
because
there
was
no
darkness
when
the
night
came

and
there
were
many
who
had
not
believed
the
words
of
the
prophets
who
fell
to
the
earth
and
became
as
if
they
were
dead
for
they
knew
that
the
great
plan
of
destruction
which
they
had
laid
for
those
who
believed
in
the
words
of
the
prophets
had
been
frustrated
for
the
sign
which
had
been
given
was
already
at
hand

and
they
began
to
know
that
the
son
of
god
must
shortly
appear
yea
in
fine
all
the
people
upon
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
from
the
west
to
the
east
both
in
the
land
north
and
in
the
land
south
were
so
exceedingly
astonished
that
they
fell
to
the
earth

for
they
knew
that
the
prophets
had
testified
of
these
things
for
many
years
and
that
the
sign
which
had
been
given
was
already
at
hand
and
they
began
to
fear
because
of
their
iniquity
and
their
unbelief

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
no
darkness
in
all
that
night
but
it
was
as
light
as
though
it
was
midday
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
sun
did
rise
in
the
morning
again
according
to
its
proper
order
and
they
knew
that
it
was
the
day
that
the
lord
should
be
born
because
of
the
sign
which
had
been
given

and
it
had
come
to
pass
yea
all
things
every
whit
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophets

and
it
came
to
pass
also
that
a
new
star
did
appear
according
to
the
word

and
it
came
to
pass
that
from
this
time
forth
there
began
to
be
lyings
sent
forth
among
the
people
by
satan
to
harden
their
hearts
to
the
intent
that
they
might
not
believe
in
those
signs
and
wonders
which
they
had
seen
but
notwithstanding
these
lyings
and
deceivings
the
more
part
of
the
people
did
believe
and
were
converted
unto
the
lord

and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephi
went
forth
among
the
people
and
also
many
others
baptizing
unto
repentance
in
the
which
there
was
a
great
remission
of
sins
and
thus
the
people
began
again
to
have
peace
in
the
land

and
there
were
no
contentions
save
it
were
a
few
that
began
to
preach
endeavoring
to
prove
by
the
scriptures
that
it
was
no
more
expedient
to
observe
the
law
of
moses
now
in
this
thing
they
did
err
having
not
understood
the
scriptures

but
it
came
to
pass
that
they
soon
became
converted
and
were
convinced
of
the
error
which
they
were
in
for
it
was
made
known
unto
them
that
the
law
was
not
yet
fulfilled
and
that
it
must
be
fulfilled
in
every
whit
yea
the
word
came
unto
them
that
it
must
be
fulfilled
yea
that
one
jot
or
tittle
should
not
pass
away
till
it
should
all
be
fulfilled
therefore
in
this
same
year
were
they
brought
to
a
knowledge
of
their
error
and
did
confess
their
faults

and
thus
the
ninety
and
second
year
did
pass
away
bringing
glad
tidings
unto
the
people
because
of
the
signs
which
did
come
to
pass
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophecy
of
all
the
holy
prophets

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
ninety
and
third
year
did
also
pass
away
in
peace
save
it
were
for
the
gadianton
robbers
who
dwelt
upon
the
mountains
who
did
infest
the
land
for
so
strong
were
their
holds
and
their
secret
places
that
the
people
could
not
overpower
them
therefore
they
did
commit
many
murders
and
did
do
much
slaughter
among
the
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
ninety
and
fourth
year
they
began
to
increase
in
great
degree
because
there
were
many
dissenters
of
the
nephites
who
did
flee
unto
them
which
did
cause
much
sorrow
unto
those
nephites
who
did
remain
in
the
land

and
there
was
also
a
cause
of
much
sorrow
among
the
lamanites
for
behold
they
had
many
children
who
did
grow
up
and
began
to
wax
strong
in
years
that
they
became
for
themselves
and
were
led
away
by
some
who
were
zoramites
by
their
lyings
and
their
flattering
words
to
join
those
gadianton
robbers

and
thus
were
the
lamanites
afflicted
also
and
began
to
decrease
as
to
their
faith
and
righteousness
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
rising
generation

nephi
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
passed
away
the
ninety
and
fifth
year
also
and
the
people
began
to
forget
those
signs
and
wonders
which
they
had
heard
and
began
to
be
less
and
less
astonished
at
a
sign
or
a
wonder
from
heaven
insomuch
that
they
began
to
be
hard
in
their
hearts
and
blind
in
their
minds
and
began
to
disbelieve
all
which
they
had
heard
and
seen

imagining
up
some
vain
thing
in
their
hearts
that
it
was
wrought
by
men
and
by
the
power
of
the
devil
to
lead
away
and
deceive
the
hearts
of
the
people
and
thus
did
satan
get
possession
of
the
hearts
of
the
people
again
insomuch
that
he
did
blind
their
eyes
and
lead
them
away
to
believe
that
the
doctrine
of
christ
was
a
foolish
and
a
vain
thing

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
began
to
wax
strong
in
wickedness
and
abominations
and
they
did
not
believe
that
there
should
be
any
more
signs
or
wonders
given
and
satan
did
go
about
leading
away
the
hearts
of
the
people
tempting
them
and
causing
them
that
they
should
do
great
wickedness
in
the
land

and
thus
did
pass
away
the
ninety
and
sixth
year
and
also
the
ninety
and
seventh
year
and
also
the
ninety
and
eighth
year
and
also
the
ninety
and
ninth
year

and
also
an
hundred
years
had
passed
away
since
the
days
of
mosiah
who
was
king
over
the
people
of
the
nephites

and
six
hundred
and
nine
years
had
passed
away
since
lehi
left
jerusalem

and
nine
years
had
passed
away
from
the
time
when
the
sign
was
given
which
was
spoken
of
by
the
prophets
that
christ
should
come
into
the
world

now
the
nephites
began
to
reckon
their
time
from
this
period
when
the
sign
was
given
or
from
the
coming
of
christ
therefore
nine
years
had
passed
away

and
nephi
who
was
the
father
of
nephi
who
had
the
charge
of
the
records
did
not
return
to
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
could
nowhere
be
found
in
all
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
did
still
remain
in
wickedness
notwithstanding
the
much
preaching
and
prophesying
which
was
sent
among
them
and
thus
passed
away
the
tenth
year
also
and
the
eleventh
year
also
passed
away
in
iniquity

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
thirteenth
year
there
began
to
be
wars
and
contentions
throughout
all
the
land
for
the
gadianton
robbers
had
become
so
numerous
and
did
slay
so
many
of
the
people
and
did
lay
waste
so
many
cities
and
did
spread
so
much
death
and
carnage
throughout
the
land
that
it
became
expedient
that
all
the
people
both
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites
should
take
up
arms
against
them

therefore
all
the
lamanites
who
had
become
converted
unto
the
lord
did
unite
with
their
brethren
the
nephites
and
were
compelled
for
the
safety
of
their
lives
and
their
women
and
their
children
to
take
up
arms
against
those
gadianton
robbers
yea
and
also
to
maintain
their
rights
and
the
privileges
of
their
church
and
of
their
worship
and
their
freedom
and
their
liberty

and
it
came
to
pass
that
before
this
thirteenth
year
had
passed
away
the
nephites
were
threatened
with
utter
destruction
because
of
this
war
which
had
become
exceedingly
sore

and
it
came
to
pass
that
those
lamanites
who
had
united
with
the
nephites
were
numbered
among
the
nephites

and
their
curse
was
taken
from
them
and
their
skin
became
white
like
unto
the
nephites

and
their
young
men
and
their
daughters
became
exceedingly
fair
and
they
were
numbered
among
the
nephites
and
were
called
nephites
and
thus
ended
the
thirteenth
year

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
fourteenth
year
the
war
between
the
robbers
and
the
people
of
nephi
did
continue
and
did
become
exceedingly
sore
nevertheless
the
people
of
nephi
did
gain
some
advantage
of
the
robbers
insomuch
that
they
did
drive
them
back
out
of
their
lands
into
the
mountains
and
into
their
secret
places

and
thus
ended
the
fourteenth
year
and
in
the
fifteenth
year
they
did
come
forth
against
the
people
of
nephi
and
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
people
of
nephi
and
their
many
contentions
and
dissensions
the
gadianton
robbers
did
gain
many
advantages
over
them

and
thus
ended
the
fifteenth
year
and
thus
were
the
people
in
a
state
of
many
afflictions
and
the
sword
of
destruction
did
hang
over
them
insomuch
that
they
were
about
to
be
smitten
down
by
it
and
this
because
of
their
iniquity

nephi
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
sixteenth
year
from
the
coming
of
christ
lachoneus
the
governor
of
the
land
received
an
epistle
from
the
leader
and
the
governor
of
this
band
of
robbers
and
these
were
the
words
which
were
written
saying

lachoneus
most
noble
and
chief
governor
of
the
land
behold
i
write
this
epistle
unto
you
and
do
give
unto
you
exceedingly
great
praise
because
of
your
firmness
and
also
the
firmness
of
your
people
in
maintaining
that
which
ye
suppose
to
be
your
right
and
liberty
yea
ye
do
stand
well
as
if
ye
were
supported
by
the
hand
of
a
god
in
the
defence
of
your
liberty
and
your
property
and
your
country
or
that
which
ye
do
call
so

and
it
seemeth
a
pity
unto
me
most
noble
lachoneus
that
ye
should
be
so
foolish
and
vain
as
to
suppose
that
ye
can
stand
against
so
many
brave
men
who
are
at
my
command
who
do
now
at
this
time
stand
in
their
arms
and
do
await
with
great
anxiety
for
the
wordgo
down
upon
the
nephites
and
destroy
them

and
i
knowing
of
their
unconquerable
spirit
having
proved
them
in
the
field
of
battle
and
knowing
of
their
everlasting
hatred
towards
you
because
of
the
many
wrongs
which
ye
have
done
unto
them
therefore
if
they
should
come
down
against
you
they
would
visit
you
with
utter
destruction

therefore
i
have
written
this
epistle
sealing
it
with
mine
own
hand
feeling
for
your
welfare
because
of
your
firmness
in
that
which
ye
believe
to
be
right
and
your
noble
spirit
in
the
field
of
battle

therefore
i
write
unto
you
desiring
that
ye
would
yield
up
unto
this
my
people
your
cities
your
lands
and
your
possessions
rather
than
that
they
should
visit
you
with
the
sword
and
that
destruction
should
come
upon
you

or
in
other
words
yield
yourselves
up
unto
us
and
unite
with
us
and
become
acquainted
with
our
secret
works
and
become
our
brethren
that
ye
may
be
like
unto
usnot
our
slaves
but
our
brethren
and
partners
of
all
our
substance

and
behold
i
swear
unto
you
if
ye
will
do
this
with
an
oath
ye
shall
not
be
destroyed
but
if
ye
will
not
do
this
i
swear
unto
you
with
an
oath
that
on
the
morrow
month
i
will
command
that
my
armies
shall
come
down
against
you
and
they
shall
not
stay
their
hand
and
shall
spare
not
but
shall
slay
you
and
shall
let
fall
the
sword
upon
you
even
until
ye
shall
become
extinct

and
behold
i
am
giddianhi
and
i
am
the
governor
of
this
the
secret
society
of
gadianton
which
society
and
the
works
thereof
i
know
to
be
good
and
they
are
of
ancient
date
and
they
have
been
handed
down
unto
us

and
i
write
this
epistle
unto
you
lachoneus
and
i
hope
that
ye
will
deliver
up
your
lands
and
your
possessions
without
the
shedding
of
blood
that
this
my
people
may
recover
their
rights
and
government
who
have
dissented
away
from
you
because
of
your
wickedness
in
retaining
from
them
their
rights
of
government
and
except
ye
do
this
i
will
avenge
their
wrongs
i
am
giddianhi

and
now
it
came
to
pass
when
lachoneus
received
this
epistle
he
was
exceedingly
astonished
because
of
the
boldness
of
giddianhi
demanding
the
possession
of
the
land
of
the
nephites
and
also
of
threatening
the
people
and
avenging
the
wrongs
of
those
that
had
received
no
wrong
save
it
were
they
had
wronged
themselves
by
dissenting
away
unto
those
wicked
and
abominable
robbers

now
behold
this
lachoneus
the
governor
was
a
just
man
and
could
not
be
frightened
by
the
demands
and
the
threatenings
of
a
robber
therefore
he
did
not
hearken
to
the
epistle
of
giddianhi
the
governor
of
the
robbers
but
he
did
cause
that
his
people
should
cry
unto
the
lord
for
strength
against
the
time
that
the
robbers
should
come
down
against
them

yea
he
sent
a
proclamation
among
all
the
people
that
they
should
gather
together
their
women
and
their
children
their
flocks
and
their
herds
and
all
their
substance
save
it
were
their
land
unto
one
place

and
he
caused
that
fortifications
should
be
built
round
about
them
and
the
strength
thereof
should
be
exceedingly
great
and
he
caused
that
armies
both
of
the
nephites
and
of
the
lamanites
or
of
all
them
who
were
numbered
among
the
nephites
should
be
placed
as
guards
round
about
to
watch
them
and
to
guard
them
from
the
robbers
day
and
night

yea
he
said
unto
them
as
the
lord
liveth
except
ye
repent
of
all
your
iniquities
and
cry
unto
the
lord
ye
will
in
no
wise
be
delivered
out
of
the
hands
of
those
gadianton
robbers

and
so
great
and
marvelous
were
the
words
and
prophecies
of
lachoneus
that
they
did
cause
fear
to
come
upon
all
the
people
and
they
did
exert
themselves
in
their
might
to
do
according
to
the
words
of
lachoneus

and
it
came
to
pass
that
lachoneus
did
appoint
chief
captains
over
all
the
armies
of
the
nephites
to
command
them
at
the
time
that
the
robbers
should
come
down
out
of
the
wilderness
against
them

now
the
chiefest
among
all
the
chief
captains
and
the
great
commander
of
the
armies
of
the
nephites
was
appointed
and
his
name
was
gidgiddoni

now
it
was
the
custom
among
all
the
nephites
to
appoint
for
their
chief
captains
save
it
were
in
their
times
of
wickedness
some
one
that
had
the
spirit
of
revelation
and
also
prophecy
therefore
this
gidgiddoni
was
a
great
prophet
among
them
as
also
was
the
chief
judge

now
the
people
said
unto
gidgiddoni
pray
unto
the
lord
and
let
us
go
up
upon
the
mountains
and
into
the
wilderness
that
we
may
fall
upon
the
robbers
and
destroy
them
in
their
own
lands

but
gidgiddoni
saith
unto
them
the
lord
forbid
for
if
we
should
go
up
against
them
the
lord
would
deliver
us
into
their
hands
therefore
we
will
prepare
ourselves
in
the
center
of
our
lands
and
we
will
gather
all
our
armies
together
and
we
will
not
go
against
them
but
we
will
wait
till
they
shall
come
against
us
therefore
as
the
lord
liveth
if
we
do
this
he
will
deliver
them
into
our
hands

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
seventeenth
year
in
the
latter
end
of
the
year
the
proclamation
of
lachoneus
had
gone
forth
throughout
all
the
face
of
the
land
and
they
had
taken
their
horses
and
their
chariots
and
their
cattle
and
all
their
flocks
and
their
herds
and
their
grain
and
all
their
substance
and
did
march
forth
by
thousands
and
by
tens
of
thousands
until
they
had
all
gone
forth
to
the
place
which
had
been
appointed
that
they
should
gather
themselves
together
to
defend
themselves
against
their
enemies

and
the
land
which
was
appointed
was
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
the
land
which
was
between
the
land
zarahemla
and
the
land
bountiful
yea
to
the
line
which
was
between
the
land
bountiful
and
the
land
desolation

and
there
were
a
great
many
thousand
people
who
were
called
nephites
who
did
gather
themselves
together
in
this
land
now
lachoneus
did
cause
that
they
should
gather
themselves
together
in
the
land
southward
because
of
the
great
curse
which
was
upon
the
land
northward

and
they
did
fortify
themselves
against
their
enemies
and
they
did
dwell
in
one
land
and
in
one
body
and
they
did
fear
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
by
lachoneus
insomuch
that
they
did
repent
of
all
their
sins
and
they
did
put
up
their
prayers
unto
the
lord
their
god
that
he
would
deliver
them
in
the
time
that
their
enemies
should
come
down
against
them
to
battle

and
they
were
exceedingly
sorrowful
because
of
their
enemies
and
gidgiddoni
did
cause
that
they
should
make
weapons
of
war
of
every
kind
and
they
should
be
strong
with
armor
and
with
shields
and
with
bucklers
after
the
manner
of
his
instruction

nephi
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
latter
end
of
the
eighteenth
year
those
armies
of
robbers
had
prepared
for
battle
and
began
to
come
down
and
to
sally
forth
from
the
hills
and
out
of
the
mountains
and
the
wilderness
and
their
strongholds
and
their
secret
places
and
began
to
take
possession
of
the
lands
both
which
were
in
the
land
south
and
which
were
in
the
land
north
and
began
to
take
possession
of
all
the
lands
which
had
been
deserted
by
the
nephites
and
the
cities
which
had
been
left
desolate

but
behold
there
were
no
wild
beasts
nor
game
in
those
lands
which
had
been
deserted
by
the
nephites
and
there
was
no
game
for
the
robbers
save
it
were
in
the
wilderness

and
the
robbers
could
not
exist
save
it
were
in
the
wilderness
for
the
want
of
food
for
the
nephites
had
left
their
lands
desolate
and
had
gathered
their
flocks
and
their
herds
and
all
their
substance
and
they
were
in
one
body

therefore
there
was
no
chance
for
the
robbers
to
plunder
and
to
obtain
food
save
it
were
to
come
up
in
open
battle
against
the
nephites
and
the
nephites
being
in
one
body
and
having
so
great
a
number
and
having
reserved
for
themselves
provisions
and
horses
and
cattle
and
flocks
of
every
kind
that
they
might
subsist
for
the
space
of
seven
years
in
the
which
time
they
did
hope
to
destroy
the
robbers
from
off
the
face
of
the
land
and
thus
the
eighteenth
year
did
pass
away

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
nineteenth
year
giddianhi
found
that
it
was
expedient
that
he
should
go
up
to
battle
against
the
nephites
for
there
was
no
way
that
they
could
subsist
save
it
were
to
plunder
and
rob
and
murder

and
they
durst
not
spread
themselves
upon
the
face
of
the
land
insomuch
that
they
could
raise
grain
lest
the
nephites
should
come
upon
them
and
slay
them
therefore
giddianhi
gave
commandment
unto
his
armies
that
in
this
year
they
should
go
up
to
battle
against
the
nephites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
come
up
to
battle
and
it
was
in
the
sixth
month
and
behold
great
and
terrible
was
the
day
that
they
did
come
up
to
battle
and
they
were
girded
about
after
the
manner
of
robbers
and
they
had
a
lambskin
about
their
loins
and
they
were
dyed
in
blood
and
their
heads
were
shorn
and
they
had
headplates
upon
them
and
great
and
terrible
was
the
appearance
of
the
armies
of
giddianhi
because
of
their
armor
and
because
of
their
being
dyed
in
blood

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
of
the
nephites
when
they
saw
the
appearance
of
the
army
of
giddianhi
had
all
fallen
to
the
earth
and
did
lift
their
cries
to
the
lord
their
god
that
he
would
spare
them
and
deliver
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
armies
of
giddianhi
saw
this
they
began
to
shout
with
a
loud
voice
because
of
their
joy
for
they
had
supposed
that
the
nephites
had
fallen
with
fear
because
of
the
terror
of
their
armies

but
in
this
thing
they
were
disappointed
for
the
nephites
did
not
fear
them
but
they
did
fear
their
god
and
did
supplicate
him
for
protection
therefore
when
the
armies
of
giddianhi
did
rush
upon
them
they
were
prepared
to
meet
them
yea
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
they
did
receive
them

and
the
battle
commenced
in
this
the
sixth
month
and
great
and
terrible
was
the
battle
thereof
yea
great
and
terrible
was
the
slaughter
thereof
insomuch
that
there
never
was
known
so
great
a
slaughter
among
all
the
people
of
lehi
since
he
left
jerusalem

and
notwithstanding
the
threatenings
and
the
oaths
which
giddianhi
had
made
behold
the
nephites
did
beat
them
insomuch
that
they
did
fall
back
from
before
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
gidgiddoni
commanded
that
his
armies
should
pursue
them
as
far
as
the
borders
of
the
wilderness
and
that
they
should
not
spare
any
that
should
fall
into
their
hands
by
the
way
and
thus
they
did
pursue
them
and
did
slay
them
to
the
borders
of
the
wilderness
even
until
they
had
fulfilled
the
commandment
of
gidgiddoni

and
it
came
to
pass
that
giddianhi
who
had
stood
and
fought
with
boldness
was
pursued
as
he
fled
and
being
weary
because
of
his
much
fighting
he
was
overtaken
and
slain
and
thus
was
the
end
of
giddianhi
the
robber

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
of
the
nephites
did
return
again
to
their
place
of
security
and
it
came
to
pass
that
this
nineteenth
year
did
pass
away
and
the
robbers
did
not
come
again
to
battle
neither
did
they
come
again
in
the
twentieth
year

and
in
the
twenty
and
first
year
they
did
not
come
up
to
battle
but
they
came
up
on
all
sides
to
lay
siege
round
about
the
people
of
nephi
for
they
did
suppose
that
if
they
should
cut
off
the
people
of
nephi
from
their
lands
and
should
hem
them
in
on
every
side
and
if
they
should
cut
them
off
from
all
their
outward
privileges
that
they
could
cause
them
to
yield
themselves
up
according
to
their
wishes

now
they
had
appointed
unto
themselves
another
leader
whose
name
was
zemnarihah
therefore
it
was
zemnarihah
that
did
cause
that
this
siege
should
take
place

but
behold
this
was
an
advantage
to
the
nephites
for
it
was
impossible
for
the
robbers
to
lay
siege
sufficiently
long
to
have
any
effect
upon
the
nephites
because
of
their
much
provision
which
they
had
laid
up
in
store

and
because
of
the
scantiness
of
provisions
among
the
robbersfor
behold
they
had
nothing
save
it
were
meat
for
their
subsistence
which
meat
they
did
obtain
in
the
wilderness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
wild
game
became
scarce
in
the
wildernessinsomuch
that
the
robbers
were
about
to
perish
with
hunger

and
the
nephites
were
continually
marching
out
by
day
and
by
night
and
falling
upon
their
armies
and
cutting
them
off
by
thousands
and
by
tens
of
thousands

and
thus
it
became
the
desire
of
the
people
of
zemnarihah
to
withdraw
from
their
design
because
of
the
great
destruction
which
came
upon
them
by
night
and
by
day

and
it
came
to
pass
that
zemnarihah
did
give
command
unto
his
people
that
they
should
withdraw
themselves
from
the
siege
and
march
into
the
furthermost
parts
of
the
land
northward

and
now
gidgiddoni
being
aware
of
their
design
and
knowing
of
their
weakness
because
of
the
want
of
food
and
the
great
slaughter
which
had
been
made
among
them
therefore
he
did
send
out
his
armies
in
the
nighttime
and
did
cut
off
the
way
of
their
retreat
and
did
place
his
armies
in
the
way
of
their
retreat

and
this
did
they
do
in
the
nighttime
and
got
on
their
march
beyond
the
robbers
so
that
on
the
morrow
when
the
robbers
began
their
march
they
were
met
by
the
armies
of
the
nephites
both
in
their
front
and
in
their
rear

and
the
robbers
who
were
on
the
south
were
also
cut
off
in
their
places
of
retreat
and
all
these
things
were
done
by
command
of
gidgiddoni

and
there
were
many
thousands
who
did
yield
themselves
up
prisoners
unto
the
nephites
and
the
remainder
of
them
were
slain

and
their
leader
zemnarihah
was
taken
and
hanged
upon
a
tree
yea
even
upon
the
top
thereof
until
he
was
dead
and
when
they
had
hanged
him
until
he
was
dead
they
did
fell
the
tree
to
the
earth
and
did
cry
with
a
loud
voice
saying

may
the
lord
preserve
his
people
in
righteousness
and
in
holiness
of
heart
that
they
may
cause
to
be
felled
to
the
earth
all
who
shall
seek
to
slay
them
because
of
power
and
secret
combinations
even
as
this
man
hath
been
felled
to
the
earth

and
they
did
rejoice
and
cry
again
with
one
voice
saying
may
the
god
of
abraham
and
the
god
of
isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
protect
this
people
in
righteousness
so
long
as
they
shall
call
on
the
name
of
their
god
for
protection

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
break
forth
all
as
one
in
singing
and
praising
their
god
for
the
great
thing
which
he
had
done
for
them
in
preserving
them
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
their
enemies

yea
they
did
cry
hosanna
to
the
most
high
god
and
they
did
cry
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
god
almighty
the
most
high
god

and
their
hearts
were
swollen
with
joy
unto
the
gushing
out
of
many
tears
because
of
the
great
goodness
of
god
in
delivering
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
and
they
knew
it
was
because
of
their
repentance
and
their
humility
that
they
had
been
delivered
from
an
everlasting
destruction

nephi
chapter


and
now
behold
there
was
not
a
living
soul
among
all
the
people
of
the
nephites
who
did
doubt
in
the
least
the
words
of
all
the
holy
prophets
who
had
spoken
for
they
knew
that
it
must
needs
be
that
they
must
be
fulfilled

and
they
knew
that
it
must
be
expedient
that
christ
had
come
because
of
the
many
signs
which
had
been
given
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophets
and
because
of
the
things
which
had
come
to
pass
already
they
knew
that
it
must
needs
be
that
all
things
should
come
to
pass
according
to
that
which
had
been
spoken

therefore
they
did
forsake
all
their
sins
and
their
abominations
and
their
whoredoms
and
did
serve
god
with
all
diligence
day
and
night

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
taken
all
the
robbers
prisoners
insomuch
that
none
did
escape
who
were
not
slain
they
did
cast
their
prisoners
into
prison
and
did
cause
the
word
of
god
to
be
preached
unto
them
and
as
many
as
would
repent
of
their
sins
and
enter
into
a
covenant
that
they
would
murder
no
more
were
set
at
liberty

but
as
many
as
there
were
who
did
not
enter
into
a
covenant
and
who
did
still
continue
to
have
those
secret
murders
in
their
hearts
yea
as
many
as
were
found
breathing
out
threatenings
against
their
brethren
were
condemned
and
punished
according
to
the
law

and
thus
they
did
put
an
end
to
all
those
wicked
and
secret
and
abominable
combinations
in
the
which
there
was
so
much
wickedness
and
so
many
murders
committed

and
thus
had
the
twenty
and
second
year
passed
away
and
the
twenty
and
third
year
also
and
the
twenty
and
fourth
and
the
twenty
and
fifth
and
thus
had
twenty
and
five
years
passed
away

and
there
had
many
things
transpired
which
in
the
eyes
of
some
would
be
great
and
marvelous
nevertheless
they
cannot
all
be
written
in
this
book
yea
this
book
cannot
contain
even
a
hundredth
part
of
what
was
done
among
so
many
people
in
the
space
of
twenty
and
five
years

but
behold
there
are
records
which
do
contain
all
the
proceedings
of
this
people
and
a
shorter
but
true
account
was
given
by
nephi

therefore
i
have
made
my
record
of
these
things
according
to
the
record
of
nephi
which
was
engraven
on
the
plates
which
were
called
the
plates
of
nephi

and
behold
i
do
make
the
record
on
plates
which
i
have
made
with
mine
own
hands

and
behold
i
am
called
mormon
being
called
after
the
land
of
mormon
the
land
in
which
alma
did
establish
the
church
among
the
people
yea
the
first
church
which
was
established
among
them
after
their
transgression

behold
i
am
a
disciple
of
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
i
have
been
called
of
him
to
declare
his
word
among
his
people
that
they
might
have
everlasting
life

and
it
hath
become
expedient
that
i
according
to
the
will
of
god
that
the
prayers
of
those
who
have
gone
hence
who
were
the
holy
ones
should
be
fulfilled
according
to
their
faith
should
make
a
record
of
these
things
which
have
been
done

yea
a
small
record
of
that
which
hath
taken
place
from
the
time
that
lehi
left
jerusalem
even
down
until
the
present
time

therefore
i
do
make
my
record
from
the
accounts
which
have
been
given
by
those
who
were
before
me
until
the
commencement
of
my
day

and
then
i
do
make
a
record
of
the
things
which
i
have
seen
with
mine
own
eyes

and
i
know
the
record
which
i
make
to
be
a
just
and
a
true
record
nevertheless
there
are
many
things
which
according
to
our
language
we
are
not
able
to
write

and
now
i
make
an
end
of
my
saying
which
is
of
myself
and
proceed
to
give
my
account
of
the
things
which
have
been
before
me

i
am
mormon
and
a
pure
descendant
of
lehi
i
have
reason
to
bless
my
god
and
my
savior
jesus
christ
that
he
brought
our
fathers
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
no
one
knew
it
save
it
were
himself
and
those
whom
he
brought
out
of
that
land
and
that
he
hath
given
me
and
my
people
so
much
knowledge
unto
the
salvation
of
our
souls

surely
he
hath
blessed
the
house
of
jacob
and
hath
been
merciful
unto
the
seed
of
joseph

and
insomuch
as
the
children
of
lehi
have
kept
his
commandments
he
hath
blessed
them
and
prospered
them
according
to
his
word

yea
and
surely
shall
he
again
bring
a
remnant
of
the
seed
of
joseph
to
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
their
god

and
as
surely
as
the
lord
liveth
will
he
gather
in
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
all
the
remnant
of
the
seed
of
jacob
who
are
scattered
abroad
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth

and
as
he
hath
covenanted
with
all
the
house
of
jacob
even
so
shall
the
covenant
wherewith
he
hath
covenanted
with
the
house
of
jacob
be
fulfilled
in
his
own
due
time
unto
the
restoring
all
the
house
of
jacob
unto
the
knowledge
of
the
covenant
that
he
hath
covenanted
with
them

and
then
shall
they
know
their
redeemer
who
is
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
and
then
shall
they
be
gathered
in
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
unto
their
own
lands
from
whence
they
have
been
dispersed
yea
as
the
lord
liveth
so
shall
it
be
amen

nephi
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
the
nephites
did
all
return
to
their
own
lands
in
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
every
man
with
his
family
his
flocks
and
his
herds
his
horses
and
his
cattle
and
all
things
whatsoever
did
belong
unto
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
had
not
eaten
up
all
their
provisions
therefore
they
did
take
with
them
all
that
they
had
not
devoured
of
all
their
grain
of
every
kind
and
their
gold
and
their
silver
and
all
their
precious
things
and
they
did
return
to
their
own
lands
and
their
possessions
both
on
the
north
and
on
the
south
both
on
the
land
northward
and
on
the
land
southward

and
they
granted
unto
those
robbers
who
had
entered
into
a
covenant
to
keep
the
peace
of
the
land
who
were
desirous
to
remain
lamanites
lands
according
to
their
numbers
that
they
might
have
with
their
labors
wherewith
to
subsist
upon
and
thus
they
did
establish
peace
in
all
the
land

and
they
began
again
to
prosper
and
to
wax
great
and
the
twenty
and
sixth
and
seventh
years
passed
away
and
there
was
great
order
in
the
land
and
they
had
formed
their
laws
according
to
equity
and
justice

and
now
there
was
nothing
in
all
the
land
to
hinder
the
people
from
prospering
continually
except
they
should
fall
into
transgression

and
now
it
was
gidgiddoni
and
the
judge
lachoneus
and
those
who
had
been
appointed
leaders
who
had
established
this
great
peace
in
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
cities
built
anew
and
there
were
many
old
cities
repaired

and
there
were
many
highways
cast
up
and
many
roads
made
which
led
from
city
to
city
and
from
land
to
land
and
from
place
to
place

and
thus
passed
away
the
twenty
and
eighth
year
and
the
people
had
continual
peace

but
it
came
to
pass
in
the
twenty
and
ninth
year
there
began
to
be
some
disputings
among
the
people
and
some
were
lifted
up
unto
pride
and
boastings
because
of
their
exceedingly
great
riches
yea
even
unto
great
persecutions

for
there
were
many
merchants
in
the
land
and
also
many
lawyers
and
many
officers

and
the
people
began
to
be
distinguished
by
ranks
according
to
their
riches
and
their
chances
for
learning
yea
some
were
ignorant
because
of
their
poverty
and
others
did
receive
great
learning
because
of
their
riches

some
were
lifted
up
in
pride
and
others
were
exceedingly
humble
some
did
return
railing
for
railing
while
others
would
receive
railing
and
persecution
and
all
manner
of
afflictions
and
would
not
turn
and
revile
again
but
were
humble
and
penitent
before
god

and
thus
there
became
a
great
inequality
in
all
the
land
insomuch
that
the
church
began
to
be
broken
up
yea
insomuch
that
in
the
thirtieth
year
the
church
was
broken
up
in
all
the
land
save
it
were
among
a
few
of
the
lamanites
who
were
converted
unto
the
true
faith
and
they
would
not
depart
from
it
for
they
were
firm
and
steadfast
and
immovable
willing
with
all
diligence
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord

now
the
cause
of
this
iniquity
of
the
people
was
thissatan
had
great
power
unto
the
stirring
up
of
the
people
to
do
all
manner
of
iniquity
and
to
the
puffing
them
up
with
pride
tempting
them
to
seek
for
power
and
authority
and
riches
and
the
vain
things
of
the
world

and
thus
satan
did
lead
away
the
hearts
of
the
people
to
do
all
manner
of
iniquity
therefore
they
had
enjoyed
peace
but
a
few
years

and
thus
in
the
commencement
of
the
thirtieth
yearthe
people
having
been
delivered
up
for
the
space
of
a
long
time
to
be
carried
about
by
the
temptations
of
the
devil
whithersoever
he
desired
to
carry
them
and
to
do
whatsoever
iniquity
he
desired
they
shouldand
thus
in
the
commencement
of
this
the
thirtieth
year
they
were
in
a
state
of
awful
wickedness

now
they
did
not
sin
ignorantly
for
they
knew
the
will
of
god
concerning
them
for
it
had
been
taught
unto
them
therefore
they
did
wilfully
rebel
against
god

and
now
it
was
in
the
days
of
lachoneus
the
son
of
lachoneus
for
lachoneus
did
fill
the
seat
of
his
father
and
did
govern
the
people
that
year

and
there
began
to
be
men
inspired
from
heaven
and
sent
forth
standing
among
the
people
in
all
the
land
preaching
and
testifying
boldly
of
the
sins
and
iniquities
of
the
people
and
testifying
unto
them
concerning
the
redemption
which
the
lord
would
make
for
his
people
or
in
other
words
the
resurrection
of
christ
and
they
did
testify
boldly
of
his
death
and
sufferings

now
there
were
many
of
the
people
who
were
exceedingly
angry
because
of
those
who
testified
of
these
things
and
those
who
were
angry
were
chiefly
the
chief
judges
and
they
who
had
been
high
priests
and
lawyers
yea
all
those
who
were
lawyers
were
angry
with
those
who
testified
of
these
things

now
there
was
no
lawyer
nor
judge
nor
high
priest
that
could
have
power
to
condemn
any
one
to
death
save
their
condemnation
was
signed
by
the
governor
of
the
land

now
there
were
many
of
those
who
testified
of
the
things
pertaining
to
christ
who
testified
boldly
who
were
taken
and
put
to
death
secretly
by
the
judges
that
the
knowledge
of
their
death
came
not
unto
the
governor
of
the
land
until
after
their
death

now
behold
this
was
contrary
to
the
laws
of
the
land
that
any
man
should
be
put
to
death
except
they
had
power
from
the
governor
of
the
land

therefore
a
complaint
came
up
unto
the
land
of
zarahemla
to
the
governor
of
the
land
against
these
judges
who
had
condemned
the
prophets
of
the
lord
unto
death
not
according
to
the
law

now
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
taken
and
brought
up
before
the
judge
to
be
judged
of
the
crime
which
they
had
done
according
to
the
law
which
had
been
given
by
the
people

now
it
came
to
pass
that
those
judges
had
many
friends
and
kindreds
and
the
remainder
yea
even
almost
all
the
lawyers
and
the
high
priests
did
gather
themselves
together
and
unite
with
the
kindreds
of
those
judges
who
were
to
be
tried
according
to
the
law

and
they
did
enter
into
a
covenant
one
with
another
yea
even
into
that
covenant
which
was
given
by
them
of
old
which
covenant
was
given
and
administered
by
the
devil
to
combine
against
all
righteousness

therefore
they
did
combine
against
the
people
of
the
lord
and
enter
into
a
covenant
to
destroy
them
and
to
deliver
those
who
were
guilty
of
murder
from
the
grasp
of
justice
which
was
about
to
be
administered
according
to
the
law

and
they
did
set
at
defiance
the
law
and
the
rights
of
their
country
and
they
did
covenant
one
with
another
to
destroy
the
governor
and
to
establish
a
king
over
the
land
that
the
land
should
no
more
be
at
liberty
but
should
be
subject
unto
kings

nephi
chapter


now
behold
i
will
show
unto
you
that
they
did
not
establish
a
king
over
the
land
but
in
this
same
year
yea
the
thirtieth
year
they
did
destroy
upon
the
judgment
seat
yea
did
murder
the
chief
judge
of
the
land

and
the
people
were
divided
one
against
another
and
they
did
separate
one
from
another
into
tribes
every
man
according
to
his
family
and
his
kindred
and
friends
and
thus
they
did
destroy
the
government
of
the
land

and
every
tribe
did
appoint
a
chief
or
a
leader
over
them
and
thus
they
became
tribes
and
leaders
of
tribes

now
behold
there
was
no
man
among
them
save
he
had
much
family
and
many
kindreds
and
friends
therefore
their
tribes
became
exceedingly
great

now
all
this
was
done
and
there
were
no
wars
as
yet
among
them
and
all
this
iniquity
had
come
upon
the
people
because
they
did
yield
themselves
unto
the
power
of
satan

and
the
regulations
of
the
government
were
destroyed
because
of
the
secret
combination
of
the
friends
and
kindreds
of
those
who
murdered
the
prophets

and
they
did
cause
a
great
contention
in
the
land
insomuch
that
the
more
righteous
part
of
the
people
had
nearly
all
become
wicked
yea
there
were
but
few
righteous
men
among
them

and
thus
six
years
had
not
passed
away
since
the
more
part
of
the
people
had
turned
from
their
righteousness
like
the
dog
to
his
vomit
or
like
the
sow
to
her
wallowing
in
the
mire

now
this
secret
combination
which
had
brought
so
great
iniquity
upon
the
people
did
gather
themselves
together
and
did
place
at
their
head
a
man
whom
they
did
call
jacob

and
they
did
call
him
their
king
therefore
he
became
a
king
over
this
wicked
band
and
he
was
one
of
the
chiefest
who
had
given
his
voice
against
the
prophets
who
testified
of
jesus

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
not
so
strong
in
number
as
the
tribes
of
the
people
who
were
united
together
save
it
were
their
leaders
did
establish
their
laws
every
one
according
to
his
tribe
nevertheless
they
were
enemies
notwithstanding
they
were
not
a
righteous
people
yet
they
were
united
in
the
hatred
of
those
who
had
entered
into
a
covenant
to
destroy
the
government

therefore
jacob
seeing
that
their
enemies
were
more
numerous
than
they
he
being
the
king
of
the
band
therefore
he
commanded
his
people
that
they
should
take
their
flight
into
the
northernmost
part
of
the
land
and
there
build
up
unto
themselves
a
kingdom
until
they
were
joined
by
dissenters
for
he
flattered
them
that
there
would
be
many
dissenters
and
they
become
sufficiently
strong
to
contend
with
the
tribes
of
the
people
and
they
did
so

and
so
speedy
was
their
march
that
it
could
not
be
impeded
until
they
had
gone
forth
out
of
the
reach
of
the
people
and
thus
ended
the
thirtieth
year
and
thus
were
the
affairs
of
the
people
of
nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
thirty
and
first
year
that
they
were
divided
into
tribes
every
man
according
to
his
family
kindred
and
friends
nevertheless
they
had
come
to
an
agreement
that
they
would
not
go
to
war
one
with
another
but
they
were
not
united
as
to
their
laws
and
their
manner
of
government
for
they
were
established
according
to
the
minds
of
those
who
were
their
chiefs
and
their
leaders
but
they
did
establish
very
strict
laws
that
one
tribe
should
not
trespass
against
another
insomuch
that
in
some
degree
they
had
peace
in
the
land
nevertheless
their
hearts
were
turned
from
the
lord
their
god
and
they
did
stone
the
prophets
and
did
cast
them
out
from
among
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephihaving
been
visited
by
angels
and
also
the
voice
of
the
lord
therefore
having
seen
angels
and
being
eyewitness
and
having
had
power
given
unto
him
that
he
might
know
concerning
the
ministry
of
christ
and
also
being
eyewitness
to
their
quick
return
from
righteousness
unto
their
wickedness
and
abominations

therefore
being
grieved
for
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
the
blindness
of
their
mindswent
forth
among
them
in
that
same
year
and
began
to
testify
boldly
repentance
and
remission
of
sins
through
faith
on
the
lord
jesus
christ

and
he
did
minister
many
things
unto
them
and
all
of
them
cannot
be
written
and
a
part
of
them
would
not
suffice
therefore
they
are
not
written
in
this
book
and
nephi
did
minister
with
power
and
with
great
authority

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
angry
with
him
even
because
he
had
greater
power
than
they
for
it
were
not
possible
that
they
could
disbelieve
his
words
for
so
great
was
his
faith
on
the
lord
jesus
christ
that
angels
did
minister
unto
him
daily

and
in
the
name
of
jesus
did
he
cast
out
devils
and
unclean
spirits
and
even
his
brother
did
he
raise
from
the
dead
after
he
had
been
stoned
and
suffered
death
by
the
people

and
the
people
saw
it
and
did
witness
of
it
and
were
angry
with
him
because
of
his
power
and
he
did
also
do
many
more
miracles
in
the
sight
of
the
people
in
the
name
of
jesus

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
thirty
and
first
year
did
pass
away
and
there
were
but
few
who
were
converted
unto
the
lord
but
as
many
as
were
converted
did
truly
signify
unto
the
people
that
they
had
been
visited
by
the
power
and
spirit
of
god
which
was
in
jesus
christ
in
whom
they
believed

and
as
many
as
had
devils
cast
out
from
them
and
were
healed
of
their
sicknesses
and
their
infirmities
did
truly
manifest
unto
the
people
that
they
had
been
wrought
upon
by
the
spirit
of
god
and
had
been
healed
and
they
did
show
forth
signs
also
and
did
do
some
miracles
among
the
people

thus
passed
away
the
thirty
and
second
year
also
and
nephi
did
cry
unto
the
people
in
the
commencement
of
the
thirty
and
third
year
and
he
did
preach
unto
them
repentance
and
remission
of
sins

now
i
would
have
you
to
remember
also
that
there
were
none
who
were
brought
unto
repentance
who
were
not
baptized
with
water

therefore
there
were
ordained
of
nephi
men
unto
this
ministry
that
all
such
as
should
come
unto
them
should
be
baptized
with
water
and
this
as
a
witness
and
a
testimony
before
god
and
unto
the
people
that
they
had
repented
and
received
a
remission
of
their
sins

and
there
were
many
in
the
commencement
of
this
year
that
were
baptized
unto
repentance
and
thus
the
more
part
of
the
year
did
pass
away

nephi
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
according
to
our
record
and
we
know
our
record
to
be
true
for
behold
it
was
a
just
man
who
did
keep
the
recordfor
he
truly
did
many
miracles
in
the
name
of
jesus
and
there
was
not
any
man
who
could
do
a
miracle
in
the
name
of
jesus
save
he
were
cleansed
every
whit
from
his
iniquity

and
now
it
came
to
pass
if
there
was
no
mistake
made
by
this
man
in
the
reckoning
of
our
time
the
thirty
and
third
year
had
passed
away

and
the
people
began
to
look
with
great
earnestness
for
the
sign
which
had
been
given
by
the
prophet
samuel
the
lamanite
yea
for
the
time
that
there
should
be
darkness
for
the
space
of
three
days
over
the
face
of
the
land

and
there
began
to
be
great
doubtings
and
disputations
among
the
people
notwithstanding
so
many
signs
had
been
given

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
thirty
and
fourth
year
in
the
first
month
on
the
fourth
day
of
the
month
there
arose
a
great
storm
such
an
one
as
never
had
been
known
in
all
the
land

and
there
was
also
a
great
and
terrible
tempest
and
there
was
terrible
thunder
insomuch
that
it
did
shake
the
whole
earth
as
if
it
was
about
to
divide
asunder

and
there
were
exceedingly
sharp
lightnings
such
as
never
had
been
known
in
all
the
land

and
the
city
of
zarahemla
did
take
fire

and
the
city
of
moroni
did
sink
into
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
were
drowned

and
the
earth
was
carried
up
upon
the
city
of
moronihah
that
in
the
place
of
the
city
there
became
a
great
mountain

and
there
was
a
great
and
terrible
destruction
in
the
land
southward

but
behold
there
was
a
more
great
and
terrible
destruction
in
the
land
northward
for
behold
the
whole
face
of
the
land
was
changed
because
of
the
tempest
and
the
whirlwinds
and
the
thunderings
and
the
lightnings
and
the
exceedingly
great
quaking
of
the
whole
earth

and
the
highways
were
broken
up
and
the
level
roads
were
spoiled
and
many
smooth
places
became
rough

and
many
great
and
notable
cities
were
sunk
and
many
were
burned
and
many
were
shaken
till
the
buildings
thereof
had
fallen
to
the
earth
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
were
slain
and
the
places
were
left
desolate

and
there
were
some
cities
which
remained
but
the
damage
thereof
was
exceedingly
great
and
there
were
many
of
them
who
were
slain

and
there
were
some
who
were
carried
away
in
the
whirlwind
and
whither
they
went
no
man
knoweth
save
they
know
that
they
were
carried
away

and
thus
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
became
deformed
because
of
the
tempests
and
the
thunderings
and
the
lightnings
and
the
quaking
of
the
earth

and
behold
the
rocks
were
rent
in
twain
they
were
broken
up
upon
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
insomuch
that
they
were
found
in
broken
fragments
and
in
seams
and
in
cracks
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
thunderings
and
the
lightnings
and
the
storm
and
the
tempest
and
the
quakings
of
the
earth
did
ceasefor
behold
they
did
last
for
about
the
space
of
three
hours
and
it
was
said
by
some
that
the
time
was
greater
nevertheless
all
these
great
and
terrible
things
were
done
in
about
the
space
of
three
hoursand
then
behold
there
was
darkness
upon
the
face
of
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
thick
darkness
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
insomuch
that
the
inhabitants
thereof
who
had
not
fallen
could
feel
the
vapor
of
darkness

and
there
could
be
no
light
because
of
the
darkness
neither
candles
neither
torches
neither
could
there
be
fire
kindled
with
their
fine
and
exceedingly
dry
wood
so
that
there
could
not
be
any
light
at
all

and
there
was
not
any
light
seen
neither
fire
nor
glimmer
neither
the
sun
nor
the
moon
nor
the
stars
for
so
great
were
the
mists
of
darkness
which
were
upon
the
face
of
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
it
did
last
for
the
space
of
three
days
that
there
was
no
light
seen
and
there
was
great
mourning
and
howling
and
weeping
among
all
the
people
continually
yea
great
were
the
groanings
of
the
people
because
of
the
darkness
and
the
great
destruction
which
had
come
upon
them

and
in
one
place
they
were
heard
to
cry
saying
o
that
we
had
repented
before
this
great
and
terrible
day
and
then
would
our
brethren
have
been
spared
and
they
would
not
have
been
burned
in
that
great
city
zarahemla

and
in
another
place
they
were
heard
to
cry
and
mourn
saying
o
that
we
had
repented
before
this
great
and
terrible
day
and
had
not
killed
and
stoned
the
prophets
and
cast
them
out
then
would
our
mothers
and
our
fair
daughters
and
our
children
have
been
spared
and
not
have
been
buried
up
in
that
great
city
moronihah
and
thus
were
the
howlings
of
the
people
great
and
terrible

nephi
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
a
voice
heard
among
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
upon
all
the
face
of
this
land
crying

wo

chapter


and
now
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
all
the
people
of
the
land
did
hear
these
sayings
and
did
witness
of
it
and
after
these
sayings
there
was
silence
in
the
land
for
the
space
of
many
hours

for
so
great
was
the
astonishment
of
the
people
that
they
did
cease
lamenting
and
howling
for
the
loss
of
their
kindred
which
had
been
slain
therefore
there
was
silence
in
all
the
land
for
the
space
of
many
hours

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
came
a
voice
again
unto
the
people
and
all
the
people
did
hear
and
did
witness
of
it
saying

o
ye
people
of
these
great
cities
which
have
fallen
who
are
descendants
of
jacob
yea
who
are
of
the
house
of
israel
how
oft
have
i
gathered
you
as
a
hen
gathereth
her
chickens
under
her
wings
and
have
nourished
you

and
again
how
oft
would
i
have
gathered
you
as
a
hen
gathereth
her
chickens
under
her
wings
yea
o
ye
people
of
the
house
of
israel
who
have
fallen
yea
o
ye
people
of
the
house
of
israel
ye
that
dwell
at
jerusalem
as
ye
that
have
fallen
yea
how
oft
would
i
have
gathered
you
as
a
hen
gathereth
her
chickens
and
ye
would
not

o
ye
house
of
israel
whom
i
have
spared
how
oft
will
i
gather
you
as
a
hen
gathereth
her
chickens
under
her
wings
if
ye
will
repent
and
return
unto
me
with
full
purpose
of
heart

but
if
not
o
house
of
israel
the
places
of
your
dwellings
shall
become
desolate
until
the
time
of
the
fulfilling
of
the
covenant
to
your
fathers

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
people
had
heard
these
words
behold
they
began
to
weep
and
howl
again
because
of
the
loss
of
their
kindred
and
friends

and
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
did
the
three
days
pass
away
and
it
was
in
the
morning
and
the
darkness
dispersed
from
off
the
face
of
the
land
and
the
earth
did
cease
to
tremble
and
the
rocks
did
cease
to
rend
and
the
dreadful
groanings
did
cease
and
all
the
tumultuous
noises
did
pass
away

and
the
earth
did
cleave
together
again
that
it
stood
and
the
mourning
and
the
weeping
and
the
wailing
of
the
people
who
were
spared
alive
did
cease
and
their
mourning
was
turned
into
joy
and
their
lamentations
into
the
praise
and
thanksgiving
unto
the
lord
jesus
christ
their
redeemer

and
thus
far
were
the
scriptures
fulfilled
which
had
been
spoken
by
the
prophets

and
it
was
the
more
righteous
part
of
the
people
who
were
saved
and
it
was
they
who
received
the
prophets
and
stoned
them
not
and
it
was
they
who
had
not
shed
the
blood
of
the
saints
who
were
spared

and
they
were
spared
and
were
not
sunk
and
buried
up
in
the
earth
and
they
were
not
drowned
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
they
were
not
burned
by
fire
neither
were
they
fallen
upon
and
crushed
to
death
and
they
were
not
carried
away
in
the
whirlwind
neither
were
they
overpowered
by
the
vapor
of
smoke
and
of
darkness

and
now
whoso
readeth
let
him
understand
he
that
hath
the
scriptures
let
him
search
them
and
see
and
behold
if
all
these
deaths
and
destructions
by
fire
and
by
smoke
and
by
tempests
and
by
whirlwinds
and
by
the
opening
of
the
earth
to
receive
them
and
all
these
things
are
not
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
prophecies
of
many
of
the
holy
prophets

behold
i
say
unto
you
yea
many
have
testified
of
these
things
at
the
coming
of
christ
and
were
slain
because
they
testified
of
these
things

yea
the
prophet
zenos
did
testify
of
these
things
and
also
zenock
spake
concerning
these
things
because
they
testified
particularly
concerning
us
who
are
the
remnant
of
their
seed

behold
our
father
jacob
also
testified
concerning
a
remnant
of
the
seed
of
joseph
and
behold
are
not
we
a
remnant
of
the
seed
of
joseph
and
these
things
which
testify
of
us
are
they
not
written
upon
the
plates
of
brass
which
our
father
lehi
brought
out
of
jerusalem

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
ending
of
the
thirty
and
fourth
year
behold
i
will
show
unto
you
that
the
people
of
nephi
who
were
spared
and
also
those
who
had
been
called
lamanites
who
had
been
spared
did
have
great
favors
shown
unto
them
and
great
blessings
poured
out
upon
their
heads
insomuch
that
soon
after
the
ascension
of
christ
into
heaven
he
did
truly
manifest
himself
unto
them

showing
his
body
unto
them
and
ministering
unto
them
and
an
account
of
his
ministry
shall
be
given
hereafter
therefore
for
this
time
i
make
an
end
of
my
sayings

nephi
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
a
great
multitude
gathered
together
of
the
people
of
nephi
round
about
the
temple
which
was
in
the
land
bountiful
and
they
were
marveling
and
wondering
one
with
another
and
were
showing
one
to
another
the
great
and
marvelous
change
which
had
taken
place

nephi

and
they
were
also
conversing
about
this
jesus
christ
of
whom
the
sign
had
been
given
concerning
his
death

and
it
came
to
pass
that
while
they
were
thus
conversing
one
with
another
they
heard
a
voice
as
if
it
came
out
of
heaven
and
they
cast
their
eyes
round
about
for
they
understood
not
the
voice
which
they
heard
and
it
was
not
a
harsh
voice
neither
was
it
a
loud
voice
nevertheless
and
notwithstanding
it
being
a
small
voice
it
did
pierce
them
that
did
hear
to
the
center
insomuch
that
there
was
no
part
of
their
frame
that
it
did
not
cause
to
quake
yea
it
did
pierce
them
to
the
very
soul
and
did
cause
their
hearts
to
burn

and
it
came
to
pass
that
again
they
heard
the
voice
and
they
understood
it
not

and
again
the
third
time
they
did
hear
the
voice
and
did
open
their
ears
to
hear
it
and
their
eyes
were
towards
the
sound
thereof
and
they
did
look
steadfastly
towards
heaven
from
whence
the
sound
came

and
behold
the
third
time
they
did
understand
the
voice
which
they
heard
and
it
said
unto
them

behold
my
beloved
son
in
whom
i
am
well
pleased
in
whom
i
have
glorified
my
namehear
ye
him

and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
understood
they
cast
their
eyes
up
again
towards
heaven
and
behold
they
saw
a
man
descending
out
of
heaven
and
he
was
clothed
in
a
white
robe
and
he
came
down
and
stood
in
the
midst
of
them
and
the
eyes
of
the
whole
multitude
were
turned
upon
him
and
they
durst
not
open
their
mouths
even
one
to
another
and
wist
not
what
it
meant
for
they
thought
it
was
an
angel
that
had
appeared
unto
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
spake
unto
the
people
saying

behold
i
am
jesus
christ
whom
the
prophets
testified
shall
come
into
the
world

and
behold
i
am
the
light
and
the
life
of
the
world
and
i
have
drunk
out
of
that
bitter
cup
which
the
father
hath
given
me
and
have
glorified
the
father
in
taking
upon
me
the
sins
of
the
world
in
the
which
i
have
suffered
the
will
of
the
father
in
all
things
from
the
beginning

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
spoken
these
words
the
whole
multitude
fell
to
the
earth
for
they
remembered
that
it
had
been
prophesied
among
them
that
christ
should
show
himself
unto
them
after
his
ascension
into
heaven

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
spake
unto
them
saying

arise
and
come
forth
unto
me
that
ye
may
thrust
your
hands
into
my
side
and
also
that
ye
may
feel
the
prints
of
the
nails
in
my
hands
and
in
my
feet
that
ye
may
know
that
i
am
the
god
of
israel
and
the
god
of
the
whole
earth
and
have
been
slain
for
the
sins
of
the
world

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
multitude
went
forth
and
thrust
their
hands
into
his
side
and
did
feel
the
prints
of
the
nails
in
his
hands
and
in
his
feet
and
this
they
did
do
going
forth
one
by
one
until
they
had
all
gone
forth
and
did
see
with
their
eyes
and
did
feel
with
their
hands
and
did
know
of
a
surety
and
did
bear
record
that
it
was
he
of
whom
it
was
written
by
the
prophets
that
should
come

and
when
they
had
all
gone
forth
and
had
witnessed
for
themselves
they
did
cry
out
with
one
accord
saying

hosanna
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
most
high
god
and
they
did
fall
down
at
the
feet
of
jesus
and
did
worship
him

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
spake
unto
nephi
for
nephi
was
among
the
multitude
and
he
commanded
him
that
he
should
come
forth

and
nephi
arose
and
went
forth
and
bowed
himself
before
the
lord
and
did
kiss
his
feet

and
the
lord
commanded
him
that
he
should
arise
and
he
arose
and
stood
before
him

and
the
lord
said
unto
him
i
give
unto
you
power
that
ye
shall
baptize
this
people
when
i
am
again
ascended
into
heaven

and
again
the
lord
called
others
and
said
unto
them
likewise
and
he
gave
unto
them
power
to
baptize
and
he
said
unto
them
on
this
wise
shall
ye
baptize
and
there
shall
be
no
disputations
among
you

verily
i
say
unto
you
that
whoso
repenteth
of
his
sins
through
your
words
and
desireth
to
be
baptized
in
my
name
on
this
wise
shall
ye
baptize
thembehold
ye
shall
go
down
and
stand
in
the
water
and
in
my
name
shall
ye
baptize
them

and
now
behold
these
are
the
words
which
ye
shall
say
calling
them
by
name
saying

having
authority
given
me
of
jesus
christ
i
baptize
you
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
amen

and
then
shall
ye
immerse
them
in
the
water
and
come
forth
again
out
of
the
water

and
after
this
manner
shall
ye
baptize
in
my
name
for
behold
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
the
father
and
the
son
and
the
holy
ghost
are
one
and
i
am
in
the
father
and
the
father
in
me
and
the
father
and
i
are
one

and
according
as
i
have
commanded
you
thus
shall
ye
baptize
and
there
shall
be
no
disputations
among
you
as
there
have
hitherto
been
neither
shall
there
be
disputations
among
you
concerning
the
points
of
my
doctrine
as
there
have
hitherto
been

for
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
he
that
hath
the
spirit
of
contention
is
not
of
me
but
is
of
the
devil
who
is
the
father
of
contention
and
he
stirreth
up
the
hearts
of
men
to
contend
with
anger
one
with
another

behold
this
is
not
my
doctrine
to
stir
up
the
hearts
of
men
with
anger
one
against
another
but
this
is
my
doctrine
that
such
things
should
be
done
away

behold
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
i
will
declare
unto
you
my
doctrine

and
this
is
my
doctrine
and
it
is
the
doctrine
which
the
father
hath
given
unto
me
and
i
bear
record
of
the
father
and
the
father
beareth
record
of
me
and
the
holy
ghost
beareth
record
of
the
father
and
me
and
i
bear
record
that
the
father
commandeth
all
men
everywhere
to
repent
and
believe
in
me

and
whoso
believeth
in
me
and
is
baptized
the
same
shall
be
saved
and
they
are
they
who
shall
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god

and
whoso
believeth
not
in
me
and
is
not
baptized
shall
be
damned

verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
this
is
my
doctrine
and
i
bear
record
of
it
from
the
father
and
whoso
believeth
in
me
believeth
in
the
father
also
and
unto
him
will
the
father
bear
record
of
me
for
he
will
visit
him
with
fire
and
with
the
holy
ghost

and
thus
will
the
father
bear
record
of
me
and
the
holy
ghost
will
bear
record
unto
him
of
the
father
and
me
for
the
father
and
i
and
the
holy
ghost
are
one

and
again
i
say
unto
you
ye
must
repent
and
become
as
a
little
child
and
be
baptized
in
my
name
or
ye
can
in
nowise
receive
these
things

and
again
i
say
unto
you
ye
must
repent
and
be
baptized
in
my
name
and
become
as
a
little
child
or
ye
can
in
nowise
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god

verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
this
is
my
doctrine
and
whoso
buildeth
upon
this
buildeth
upon
my
rock
and
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
against
them

and
whoso
shall
declare
more
or
less
than
this
and
establish
it
for
my
doctrine
the
same
cometh
of
evil
and
is
not
built
upon
my
rock
but
he
buildeth
upon
a
sandy
foundation
and
the
gates
of
hell
stand
open
to
receive
such
when
the
floods
come
and
the
winds
beat
upon
them

therefore
go
forth
unto
this
people
and
declare
the
words
which
i
have
spoken
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth

nephi
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
spoken
these
words
unto
nephi
and
to
those
who
had
been
called
now
the
number
of
them
who
had
been
called
and
received
power
and
authority
to
baptize
was
twelve
and
behold
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
unto
the
multitude
and
cried
unto
them
saying
blessed
are
ye
if
ye
shall
give
heed
unto
the
words
of
these
twelve
whom
i
have
chosen
from
among
you
to
minister
unto
you
and
to
be
your
servants
and
unto
them
i
have
given
power
that
they
may
baptize
you
with
water
and
after
that
ye
are
baptized
with
water
behold
i
will
baptize
you
with
fire
and
with
the
holy
ghost
therefore
blessed
are
ye
if
ye
shall
believe
in
me
and
be
baptized
after
that
ye
have
seen
me
and
know
that
i
am

and
again
more
blessed
are
they
who
shall
believe
in
your
words
because
that
ye
shall
testify
that
ye
have
seen
me
and
that
ye
know
that
i
am
yea
blessed
are
they
who
shall
believe
in
your
words
and
come
down
into
the
depths
of
humility
and
be
baptized
for
they
shall
be
visited
with
fire
and
with
the
holy
ghost
and
shall
receive
a
remission
of
their
sins

yea
blessed
are
the
poor
in
spirit
who
come
unto
me
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven

and
again
blessed
are
all
they
that
mourn
for
they
shall
be
comforted

and
blessed
are
the
meek
for
they
shall
inherit
the
earth

and
blessed
are
all
they
who
do
hunger
and
thirst
after
righteousness
for
they
shall
be
filled
with
the
holy
ghost

and
blessed
are
the
merciful
for
they
shall
obtain
mercy

and
blessed
are
all
the
pure
in
heart
for
they
shall
see
god

and
blessed
are
all
the
peacemakers
for
they
shall
be
called
the
children
of
god

and
blessed
are
all
they
who
are
persecuted
for
my
names
sake
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven

and
blessed
are
ye
when
men
shall
revile
you
and
persecute
and
shall
say
all
manner
of
evil
against
you
falsely
for
my
sake

for
ye
shall
have
great
joy
and
be
exceedingly
glad
for
great
shall
be
your
reward
in
heaven
for
so
persecuted
they
the
prophets
who
were
before
you

verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
i
give
unto
you
to
be
the
salt
of
the
earth
but
if
the
salt
shall
lose
its
savor
wherewith
shall
the
earth
be
salted
the
salt
shall
be
thenceforth
good
for
nothing
but
to
be
cast
out
and
to
be
trodden
under
foot
of
men

verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
i
give
unto
you
to
be
the
light
of
this
people
a
city
that
is
set
on
a
hill
cannot
be
hid

behold
do
men
light
a
candle
and
put
it
under
a
bushel
nay
but
on
a
candlestick
and
it
giveth
light
to
all
that
are
in
the
house

therefore
let
your
light
so
shine
before
this
people
that
they
may
see
your
good
works
and
glorify
your
father
who
is
in
heaven

think
not
that
i
am
come
to
destroy
the
law
or
the
prophets
i
am
not
come
to
destroy
but
to
fulfil

for
verily
i
say
unto
you
one
jot
nor
tittle
hath
not
passed
away
from
the
law
but
in
me
it
hath
all
been
fulfilled

and
behold
i
have
given
you
the
law
and
the
commandments
of
my
father
that
ye
shall
believe
in
me
and
that
ye
shall
repent
of
your
sins
and
come
unto
me
with
a
broken
heart
and
a
contrite
spirit
behold
ye
have
the
commandments
before
you
and
the
law
is
fulfilled

therefore
come
unto
me
and
be
ye
saved
for
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
except
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
which
i
have
commanded
you
at
this
time
ye
shall
in
no
case
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven

ye
have
heard
that
it
hath
been
said
by
them
of
old
time
and
it
is
also
written
before
you
that
thou
shalt
not
kill
and
whosoever
shall
kill
shall
be
in
danger
of
the
judgment
of
god

but
i
say
unto
you
that
whosoever
is
angry
with
his
brother
shall
be
in
danger
of
his
judgment
and
whosoever
shall
say
to
his
brother
raca
shall
be
in
danger
of
the
council
and
whosoever
shall
say
thou
fool
shall
be
in
danger
of
hell
fire

therefore
if
ye
shall
come
unto
me
or
shall
desire
to
come
unto
me
and
rememberest
that
thy
brother
hast
aught
against
thee

go
thy
way
unto
thy
brother
and
first
be
reconciled
to
thy
brother
and
then
come
unto
me
with
full
purpose
of
heart
and
i
will
receive
you

agree
with
thine
adversary
quickly
while
thou
art
in
the
way
with
him
lest
at
any
time
he
shall
get
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
cast
into
prison

verily
verily
i
say
unto
thee
thou
shalt
by
no
means
come
out
thence
until
thou
hast
paid
the
uttermost
senine
and
while
ye
are
in
prison
can
ye
pay
even
one
senine
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
nay

behold
it
is
written
by
them
of
old
time
that
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery

but
i
say
unto
you
that
whosoever
looketh
on
a
woman
to
lust
after
her
hath
committed
adultery
already
in
his
heart

behold
i
give
unto
you
a
commandment
that
ye
suffer
none
of
these
things
to
enter
into
your
heart

for
it
is
better
that
ye
should
deny
yourselves
of
these
things
wherein
ye
will
take
up
your
cross
than
that
ye
should
be
cast
into
hell

it
hath
been
written
that
whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife
let
him
give
her
a
writing
of
divorcement

verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife
saving
for
the
cause
of
fornication
causeth
her
to
commit
adultery
and
whoso
shall
marry
her
who
is
divorced
committeth
adultery

and
again
it
is
written
thou
shalt
not
forswear
thyself
but
shalt
perform
unto
the
lord
thine
oaths

but
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
swear
not
at
all
neither
by
heaven
for
it
is
gods
throne

nor
by
the
earth
for
it
is
his
footstool

neither
shalt
thou
swear
by
thy
head
because
thou
canst
not
make
one
hair
black
or
white

but
let
your
communication
be
yea
yea
nay
nay
for
whatsoever
cometh
of
more
than
these
is
evil

and
behold
it
is
written
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth

but
i
say
unto
you
that
ye
shall
not
resist
evil
but
whosoever
shall
smite
thee
on
thy
right
cheek
turn
to
him
the
other
also

and
if
any
man
will
sue
thee
at
the
law
and
take
away
thy
coat
let
him
have
thy
cloak
also

and
whosoever
shall
compel
thee
to
go
a
mile
go
with
him
twain

give
to
him
that
asketh
thee
and
from
him
that
would
borrow
of
thee
turn
not
away

and
behold
it
is
written
also
that
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
and
hate
thine
enemy

but
i
say
unto
you
love
your
enemies
bless
them
that
curse
you
do
good
to
them
that
hate
you
and
pray
for
them
who
despitefully
use
you
and
persecute
you

that
ye
may
be
the
children
of
your
father
who
is
in
heaven
for
he
maketh
his
sun
to
rise
on
the
evil
and
on
the
good

therefore
those
things
which
were
of
old
time
which
were
under
the
law
in
me
are
all
fulfilled

old
things
are
done
away
and
all
things
have
become
new

therefore
i
would
that
ye
should
be
perfect
even
as
i
or
your
father
who
is
in
heaven
is
perfect

nephi
chapter


verily
verily
i
say
that
i
would
that
ye
should
do
alms
unto
the
poor
but
take
heed
that
ye
do
not
your
alms
before
men
to
be
seen
of
them
otherwise
ye
have
no
reward
of
your
father
who
is
in
heaven

therefore
when
ye
shall
do
your
alms
do
not
sound
a
trumpet
before
you
as
will
hypocrites
do
in
the
synagogues
and
in
the
streets
that
they
may
have
glory
of
men
verily
i
say
unto
you
they
have
their
reward

but
when
thou
doest
alms
let
not
thy
left
hand
know
what
thy
right
hand
doeth

that
thine
alms
may
be
in
secret
and
thy
father
who
seeth
in
secret
himself
shall
reward
thee
openly

and
when
thou
prayest
thou
shalt
not
do
as
the
hypocrites
for
they
love
to
pray
standing
in
the
synagogues
and
in
the
corners
of
the
streets
that
they
may
be
seen
of
men
verily
i
say
unto
you
they
have
their
reward

but
thou
when
thou
prayest
enter
into
thy
closet
and
when
thou
hast
shut
thy
door
pray
to
thy
father
who
is
in
secret
and
thy
father
who
seeth
in
secret
shall
reward
thee
openly

but
when
ye
pray
use
not
vain
repetitions
as
the
heathen
for
they
think
that
they
shall
be
heard
for
their
much
speaking

be
not
ye
therefore
like
unto
them
for
your
father
knoweth
what
things
ye
have
need
of
before
ye
ask
him

after
this
manner
therefore
pray
ye
our
father
who
art
in
heaven
hallowed
be
thy
name

thy
will
be
done
on
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven

and
forgive
us
our
debts
as
we
forgive
our
debtors

and
lead
us
not
into
temptation
but
deliver
us
from
evil

for
thine
is
the
kingdom
and
the
power
and
the
glory
forever
amen

for
if
ye
forgive
men
their
trespasses
your
heavenly
father
will
also
forgive
you

but
if
ye
forgive
not
men
their
trespasses
neither
will
your
father
forgive
your
trespasses

moreover
when
ye
fast
be
not
as
the
hypocrites
of
a
sad
countenance
for
they
disfigure
their
faces
that
they
may
appear
unto
men
to
fast
verily
i
say
unto
you
they
have
their
reward

but
thou
when
thou
fastest
anoint
thy
head
and
wash
thy
face

that
thou
appear
not
unto
men
to
fast
but
unto
thy
father
who
is
in
secret
and
thy
father
who
seeth
in
secret
shall
reward
thee
openly

lay
not
up
for
yourselves
treasures
upon
earth
where
moth
and
rust
doth
corrupt
and
thieves
break
through
and
steal

but
lay
up
for
yourselves
treasures
in
heaven
where
neither
moth
nor
rust
doth
corrupt
and
where
thieves
do
not
break
through
nor
steal

for
where
your
treasure
is
there
will
your
heart
be
also

the
light
of
the
body
is
the
eye
if
therefore
thine
eye
be
single
thy
whole
body
shall
be
full
of
light

but
if
thine
eye
be
evil
thy
whole
body
shall
be
full
of
darkness
if
therefore
the
light
that
is
in
thee
be
darkness
how
great
is
that
darkness

no
man
can
serve
two
masters
for
either
he
will
hate
the
one
and
love
the
other
or
else
he
will
hold
to
the
one
and
despise
the
other
ye
cannot
serve
god
and
mammon

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
spoken
these
words
he
looked
upon
the
twelve
whom
he
had
chosen
and
said
unto
them
remember
the
words
which
i
have
spoken
for
behold
ye
are
they
whom
i
have
chosen
to
minister
unto
this
people
therefore
i
say
unto
you
take
no
thought
for
your
life
what
ye
shall
eat
or
what
ye
shall
drink
nor
yet
for
your
body
what
ye
shall
put
on
is
not
the
life
more
than
meat
and
the
body
than
raiment

behold
the
fowls
of
the
air
for
they
sow
not
neither
do
they
reap
nor
gather
into
barns
yet
your
heavenly
father
feedeth
them
are
ye
not
much
better
than
they

which
of
you
by
taking
thought
can
add
one
cubit
unto
his
stature

and
why
take
ye
thought
for
raiment
consider
the
lilies
of
the
field
how
they
grow
they
toil
not
neither
do
they
spin

and
yet
i
say
unto
you
that
even
solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
not
arrayed
like
one
of
these

wherefore
if
god
so
clothe
the
grass
of
the
field
which
today
is
and
tomorrow
is
cast
into
the
oven
even
so
will
he
clothe
you
if
ye
are
not
of
little
faith

therefore
take
no
thought
saying
what
shall
we
eat
or
what
shall
we
drink
or
wherewithal
shall
we
be
clothed

for
your
heavenly
father
knoweth
that
ye
have
need
of
all
these
things

but
seek
ye
first
the
kingdom
of
god
and
his
righteousness
and
all
these
things
shall
be
added
unto
you

take
therefore
no
thought
for
the
morrow
for
the
morrow
shall
take
thought
for
the
things
of
itself
sufficient
is
the
day
unto
the
evil
thereof

nephi
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
spoken
these
words
he
turned
again
to
the
multitude
and
did
open
his
mouth
unto
them
again
saying
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
judge
not
that
ye
be
not
judged

for
with
what
judgment
ye
judge
ye
shall
be
judged
and
with
what
measure
ye
mete
it
shall
be
measured
to
you
again

and
why
beholdest
thou
the
mote
that
is
in
thy
brothers
eye
but
considerest
not
the
beam
that
is
in
thine
own
eye

or
how
wilt
thou
say
to
thy
brother
let
me
pull
the
mote
out
of
thine
eyeand
behold
a
beam
is
in
thine
own
eye

thou
hypocrite
first
cast
the
beam
out
of
thine
own
eye
and
then
shalt
thou
see
clearly
to
cast
the
mote
out
of
thy
brothers
eye

give
not
that
which
is
holy
unto
the
dogs
neither
cast
ye
your
pearls
before
swine
lest
they
trample
them
under
their
feet
and
turn
again
and
rend
you

ask
and
it
shall
be
given
unto
you
seek
and
ye
shall
find
knock
and
it
shall
be
opened
unto
you

for
every
one
that
asketh
receiveth
and
he
that
seeketh
findeth
and
to
him
that
knocketh
it
shall
be
opened

or
what
man
is
there
of
you
who
if
his
son
ask
bread
will
give
him
a
stone

or
if
he
ask
a
fish
will
he
give
him
a
serpent

if
ye
then
being
evil
know
how
to
give
good
gifts
unto
your
children
how
much
more
shall
your
father
who
is
in
heaven
give
good
things
to
them
that
ask
him

therefore
all
things
whatsoever
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
do
ye
even
so
to
them
for
this
is
the
law
and
the
prophets

enter
ye
in
at
the
strait
gate
for
wide
is
the
gate
and
broad
is
the
way
which
leadeth
to
destruction
and
many
there
be
who
go
in
thereat

because
strait
is
the
gate
and
narrow
is
the
way
which
leadeth
unto
life
and
few
there
be
that
find
it

beware
of
false
prophets
who
come
to
you
in
sheeps
clothing
but
inwardly
they
are
ravening
wolves

ye
shall
know
them
by
their
fruits
do
men
gather
grapes
of
thorns
or
figs
of
thistles

even
so
every
good
tree
bringeth
forth
good
fruit
but
a
corrupt
tree
bringeth
forth
evil
fruit

a
good
tree
cannot
bring
forth
evil
fruit
neither
a
corrupt
tree
bring
forth
good
fruit

every
tree
that
bringeth
not
forth
good
fruit
is
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire

wherefore
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them

not
every
one
that
saith
unto
me
lord
lord
shall
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
he
that
doeth
the
will
of
my
father
who
is
in
heaven

many
will
say
to
me
in
that
day
lord
lord
have
we
not
prophesied
in
thy
name
and
in
thy
name
have
cast
out
devils
and
in
thy
name
done
many
wonderful
works

and
then
will
i
profess
unto
them
i
never
knew
you
depart
from
me
ye
that
work
iniquity

therefore
whoso
heareth
these
sayings
of
mine
and
doeth
them
i
will
liken
him
unto
a
wise
man
who
built
his
house
upon
a
rock

and
the
rain
descended
and
the
floods
came
and
the
winds
blew
and
beat
upon
that
house
and
it
fell
not
for
it
was
founded
upon
a
rock

and
every
one
that
heareth
these
sayings
of
mine
and
doeth
them
not
shall
be
likened
unto
a
foolish
man
who
built
his
house
upon
the
sand

and
the
rain
descended
and
the
floods
came
and
the
winds
blew
and
beat
upon
that
house
and
it
fell
and
great
was
the
fall
of
it

nephi
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
ended
these
sayings
he
cast
his
eyes
round
about
on
the
multitude
and
said
unto
them
behold
ye
have
heard
the
things
which
i
taught
before
i
ascended
to
my
father
therefore
whoso
remembereth
these
sayings
of
mine
and
doeth
them
him
will
i
raise
up
at
the
last
day

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
said
these
words
he
perceived
that
there
were
some
among
them
who
marveled
and
wondered
what
he
would
concerning
the
law
of
moses
for
they
understood
not
the
saying
that
old
things
had
passed
away
and
that
all
things
had
become
new

and
he
said
unto
them
marvel
not
that
i
said
unto
you
that
old
things
had
passed
away
and
that
all
things
had
become
new

behold
i
say
unto
you
that
the
law
is
fulfilled
that
was
given
unto
moses

behold
i
am
he
that
gave
the
law
and
i
am
he
who
covenanted
with
my
people
israel
therefore
the
law
in
me
is
fulfilled
for
i
have
come
to
fulfil
the
law
therefore
it
hath
an
end

behold
i
do
not
destroy
the
prophets
for
as
many
as
have
not
been
fulfilled
in
me
verily
i
say
unto
you
shall
all
be
fulfilled

and
because
i
said
unto
you
that
old
things
have
passed
away
i
do
not
destroy
that
which
hath
been
spoken
concerning
things
which
are
to
come

for
behold
the
covenant
which
i
have
made
with
my
people
is
not
all
fulfilled
but
the
law
which
was
given
unto
moses
hath
an
end
in
me

behold
i
am
the
law
and
the
light
look
unto
me
and
endure
to
the
end
and
ye
shall
live
for
unto
him
that
endureth
to
the
end
will
i
give
eternal
life

behold
i
have
given
unto
you
the
commandments
therefore
keep
my
commandments
and
this
is
the
law
and
the
prophets
for
they
truly
testified
of
me

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
spoken
these
words
he
said
unto
those
twelve
whom
he
had
chosen

ye
are
my
disciples
and
ye
are
a
light
unto
this
people
who
are
a
remnant
of
the
house
of
joseph

and
behold
this
is
the
land
of
your
inheritance
and
the
father
hath
given
it
unto
you

and
not
at
any
time
hath
the
father
given
me
commandment
that
i
should
tell
it
unto
your
brethren
at
jerusalem

neither
at
any
time
hath
the
father
given
me
commandment
that
i
should
tell
unto
them
concerning
the
other
tribes
of
the
house
of
israel
whom
the
father
hath
led
away
out
of
the
land

this
much
did
the
father
command
me
that
i
should
tell
unto
them

that
other
sheep
i
have
which
are
not
of
this
fold
them
also
i
must
bring
and
they
shall
hear
my
voice
and
there
shall
be
one
fold
and
one
shepherd

and
now
because
of
stiffneckedness
and
unbelief
they
understood
not
my
word
therefore
i
was
commanded
to
say
no
more
of
the
father
concerning
this
thing
unto
them

but
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
the
father
hath
commanded
me
and
i
tell
it
unto
you
that
ye
were
separated
from
among
them
because
of
their
iniquity
therefore
it
is
because
of
their
iniquity
that
they
know
not
of
you

and
verily
i
say
unto
you
again
that
the
other
tribes
hath
the
father
separated
from
them
and
it
is
because
of
their
iniquity
that
they
know
not
of
them

and
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
ye
are
they
of
whom
i
said
other
sheep
i
have
which
are
not
of
this
fold
them
also
i
must
bring
and
they
shall
hear
my
voice
and
there
shall
be
one
fold
and
one
shepherd

and
they
understood
me
not
for
they
supposed
it
had
been
the
gentiles
for
they
understood
not
that
the
gentiles
should
be
converted
through
their
preaching

and
they
understood
me
not
that
i
said
they
shall
hear
my
voice
and
they
understood
me
not
that
the
gentiles
should
not
at
any
time
hear
my
voicethat
i
should
not
manifest
myself
unto
them
save
it
were
by
the
holy
ghost

but
behold
ye
have
both
heard
my
voice
and
seen
me
and
ye
are
my
sheep
and
ye
are
numbered
among
those
whom
the
father
hath
given
me

nephi
chapter


and
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
i
have
other
sheep
which
are
not
of
this
land
neither
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
neither
in
any
parts
of
that
land
round
about
whither
i
have
been
to
minister

for
they
of
whom
i
speak
are
they
who
have
not
as
yet
heard
my
voice
neither
have
i
at
any
time
manifested
myself
unto
them

but
i
have
received
a
commandment
of
the
father
that
i
shall
go
unto
them
and
that
they
shall
hear
my
voice
and
shall
be
numbered
among
my
sheep
that
there
may
be
one
fold
and
one
shepherd
therefore
i
go
to
show
myself
unto
them

and
i
command
you
that
ye
shall
write
these
sayings
after
i
am
gone
that
if
it
so
be
that
my
people
at
jerusalem
they
who
have
seen
me
and
been
with
me
in
my
ministry
do
not
ask
the
father
in
my
name
that
they
may
receive
a
knowledge
of
you
by
the
holy
ghost
and
also
of
the
other
tribes
whom
they
know
not
of
that
these
sayings
which
ye
shall
write
shall
be
kept
and
shall
be
manifested
unto
the
gentiles
that
through
the
fulness
of
the
gentiles
the
remnant
of
their
seed
who
shall
be
scattered
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
because
of
their
unbelief
may
be
brought
in
or
may
be
brought
to
a
knowledge
of
me
their
redeemer

and
then
will
i
gather
them
in
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
and
then
will
i
fulfill
the
covenant
which
the
father
hath
made
unto
all
the
people
of
the
house
of
israel

and
blessed
are
the
gentiles
because
of
their
belief
in
me
in
and
of
the
holy
ghost
which
witnesses
unto
them
of
me
and
of
the
father

behold
because
of
their
belief
in
me
saith
the
father
and
because
of
the
unbelief
of
you
o
house
of
israel
in
the
latter
day
shall
the
truth
come
unto
the
gentiles
that
the
fulness
of
these
things
shall
be
made
known
unto
them

but
wo
saith
the
father
unto
the
unbelieving
of
the
gentilesfor
notwithstanding
they
have
come
forth
upon
the
face
of
this
land
and
have
scattered
my
people
who
are
of
the
house
of
israel
and
my
people
who
are
of
the
house
of
israel
have
been
cast
out
from
among
them
and
have
been
trodden
under
feet
by
them

and
because
of
the
mercies
of
the
father
unto
the
gentiles
and
also
the
judgments
of
the
father
upon
my
people
who
are
of
the
house
of
israel
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
after
all
this
and
i
have
caused
my
people
who
are
of
the
house
of
israel
to
be
smitten
and
to
be
afflicted
and
to
be
slain
and
to
be
cast
out
from
among
them
and
to
become
hated
by
them
and
to
become
a
hiss
and
a
byword
among
them

and
thus
commandeth
the
father
that
i
should
say
unto
you
at
that
day
when
the
gentiles
shall
sin
against
my
gospel
and
shall
reject
the
fulness
of
my
gospel
and
shall
be
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
hearts
above
all
nations
and
above
all
the
people
of
the
whole
earth
and
shall
be
filled
with
all
manner
of
lyings
and
of
deceits
and
of
mischiefs
and
all
manner
of
hypocrisy
and
murders
and
priestcrafts
and
whoredoms
and
of
secret
abominations
and
if
they
shall
do
all
those
things
and
shall
reject
the
fulness
of
my
gospel
behold
saith
the
father
i
will
bring
the
fulness
of
my
gospel
from
among
them

and
then
will
i
remember
my
covenant
which
i
have
made
unto
my
people
o
house
of
israel
and
i
will
bring
my
gospel
unto
them

and
i
will
show
unto
thee
o
house
of
israel
that
the
gentiles
shall
not
have
power
over
you
but
i
will
remember
my
covenant
unto
you
o
house
of
israel
and
ye
shall
come
unto
the
knowledge
of
the
fulness
of
my
gospel

but
if
the
gentiles
will
repent
and
return
unto
me
saith
the
father
behold
they
shall
be
numbered
among
my
people
o
house
of
israel

and
i
will
not
suffer
my
people
who
are
of
the
house
of
israel
to
go
through
among
them
and
tread
them
down
saith
the
father

but
if
they
will
not
turn
unto
me
and
hearken
unto
my
voice
i
will
suffer
them
yea
i
will
suffer
my
people
o
house
of
israel
that
they
shall
go
through
among
them
and
shall
tread
them
down
and
they
shall
be
as
salt
that
hath
lost
its
savor
which
is
thenceforth
good
for
nothing
but
to
be
cast
out
and
to
be
trodden
under
foot
of
my
people
o
house
of
israel

verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
thus
hath
the
father
commanded
methat
i
should
give
unto
this
people
this
land
for
their
inheritance

and
then
the
words
of
the
prophet
isaiah
shall
be
fulfilled
which
say

thy
watchmen
shall
lift
up
the
voice
with
the
voice
together
shall
they
sing
for
they
shall
see
eye
to
eye
when
the
lord
shall
bring
again
zion

break
forth
into
joy
sing
together
ye
waste
places
of
jerusalem
for
the
lord
hath
comforted
his
people
he
hath
redeemed
jerusalem

the
lord
hath
made
bare
his
holy
arm
in
the
eye
of
all
the
nations
and
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
shall
see
the
salvation
of
god

nephi
chapter


behold
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
spoken
these
words
he
looked
round
about
again
on
the
multitude
and
he
said
unto
them
behold
my
time
is
at
hand

i
perceive
that
ye
are
weak
that
ye
cannot
understand
all
my
words
which
i
am
commanded
of
the
father
to
speak
unto
you
at
this
time

therefore
go
ye
unto
your
homes
and
ponder
upon
the
things
which
i
have
said
and
ask
of
the
father
in
my
name
that
ye
may
understand
and
prepare
your
minds
for
the
morrow
and
i
come
unto
you
again

but
now
i
go
unto
the
father
and
also
to
show
myself
unto
the
lost
tribes
of
israel
for
they
are
not
lost
unto
the
father
for
he
knoweth
whither
he
hath
taken
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
thus
spoken
he
cast
his
eyes
round
about
again
on
the
multitude
and
beheld
they
were
in
tears
and
did
look
steadfastly
upon
him
as
if
they
would
ask
him
to
tarry
a
little
longer
with
them

and
he
said
unto
them
behold
my
bowels
are
filled
with
compassion
towards
you

have
ye
any
that
are
sick
among
you
bring
them
hither
have
ye
any
that
are
lame
or
blind
or
halt
or
maimed
or
leprous
or
that
are
withered
or
that
are
deaf
or
that
are
afflicted
in
any
manner
bring
them
hither
and
i
will
heal
them
for
i
have
compassion
upon
you
my
bowels
are
filled
with
mercy

for
i
perceive
that
ye
desire
that
i
should
show
unto
you
what
i
have
done
unto
your
brethren
at
jerusalem
for
i
see
that
your
faith
is
sufficient
that
i
should
heal
you

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
thus
spoken
all
the
multitude
with
one
accord
did
go
forth
with
their
sick
and
their
afflicted
and
their
lame
and
with
their
blind
and
with
their
dumb
and
with
all
them
that
were
afflicted
in
any
manner
and
he
did
heal
them
every
one
as
they
were
brought
forth
unto
him

and
they
did
all
both
they
who
had
been
healed
and
they
who
were
whole
bow
down
at
his
feet
and
did
worship
him
and
as
many
as
could
come
for
the
multitude
did
kiss
his
feet
insomuch
that
they
did
bathe
his
feet
with
their
tears

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
commanded
that
their
little
children
should
be
brought

so
they
brought
their
little
children
and
set
them
down
upon
the
ground
round
about
him
and
jesus
stood
in
the
midst
and
the
multitude
gave
way
till
they
had
all
been
brought
unto
him

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
all
been
brought
and
jesus
stood
in
the
midst
he
commanded
the
multitude
that
they
should
kneel
down
upon
the
ground

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
knelt
upon
the
ground
jesus
groaned
within
himself
and
said
father
i
am
troubled
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
people
of
the
house
of
israel

and
when
he
had
said
these
words
he
himself
also
knelt
upon
the
earth
and
behold
he
prayed
unto
the
father
and
the
things
which
he
prayed
cannot
be
written
and
the
multitude
did
bear
record
who
heard
him

and
after
this
manner
do
they
bear
record
the
eye
hath
never
seen
neither
hath
the
ear
heard
before
so
great
and
marvelous
things
as
we
saw
and
heard
jesus
speak
unto
the
father

and
no
tongue
can
speak
neither
can
there
be
written
by
any
man
neither
can
the
hearts
of
men
conceive
so
great
and
marvelous
things
as
we
both
saw
and
heard
jesus
speak
and
no
one
can
conceive
of
the
joy
which
filled
our
souls
at
the
time
we
heard
him
pray
for
us
unto
the
father

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
made
an
end
of
praying
unto
the
father
he
arose
but
so
great
was
the
joy
of
the
multitude
that
they
were
overcome

and
it
came
to
pass
that
jesus
spake
unto
them
and
bade
them
arise

and
they
arose
from
the
earth
and
he
said
unto
them
blessed
are
ye
because
of
your
faith
and
now
behold
my
joy
is
full

and
when
he
had
said
these
words
he
wept
and
the
multitude
bare
record
of
it
and
he
took
their
little
children
one
by
one
and
blessed
them
and
prayed
unto
the
father
for
them

and
when
he
had
done
this
he
wept
again

and
he
spake
unto
the
multitude
and
said
unto
them
behold
your
little
ones

and
as
they
looked
to
behold
they
cast
their
eyes
towards
heaven
and
they
saw
the
heavens
open
and
they
saw
angels
descending
out
of
heaven
as
it
were
in
the
midst
of
fire
and
they
came
down
and
encircled
those
little
ones
about
and
they
were
encircled
about
with
fire
and
the
angels
did
minister
unto
them

and
the
multitude
did
see
and
hear
and
bear
record
and
they
know
that
their
record
is
true
for
they
all
of
them
did
see
and
hear
every
man
for
himself
and
they
were
in
number
about
two
thousand
and
five
hundred
souls
and
they
did
consist
of
men
women
and
children

nephi
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
jesus
commanded
his
disciples
that
they
should
bring
forth
some
bread
and
wine
unto
him

and
while
they
were
gone
for
bread
and
wine
he
commanded
the
multitude
that
they
should
sit
themselves
down
upon
the
earth

and
when
the
disciples
had
come
with
bread
and
wine
he
took
of
the
bread
and
brake
and
blessed
it
and
he
gave
unto
the
disciples
and
commanded
that
they
should
eat

and
when
they
had
eaten
and
were
filled
he
commanded
that
they
should
give
unto
the
multitude

and
when
the
multitude
had
eaten
and
were
filled
he
said
unto
the
disciples
behold
there
shall
one
be
ordained
among
you
and
to
him
will
i
give
power
that
he
shall
break
bread
and
bless
it
and
give
it
unto
the
people
of
my
church
unto
all
those
who
shall
believe
and
be
baptized
in
my
name

and
this
shall
ye
always
observe
to
do
even
as
i
have
done
even
as
i
have
broken
bread
and
blessed
it
and
given
it
unto
you

and
this
shall
ye
do
in
remembrance
of
my
body
which
i
have
shown
unto
you
and
it
shall
be
a
testimony
unto
the
father
that
ye
do
always
remember
me
and
if
ye
do
always
remember
me
ye
shall
have
my
spirit
to
be
with
you

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
said
these
words
he
commanded
his
disciples
that
they
should
take
of
the
wine
of
the
cup
and
drink
of
it
and
that
they
should
also
give
unto
the
multitude
that
they
might
drink
of
it

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
so
and
did
drink
of
it
and
were
filled
and
they
gave
unto
the
multitude
and
they
did
drink
and
they
were
filled

and
when
the
disciples
had
done
this
jesus
said
unto
them
blessed
are
ye
for
this
thing
which
ye
have
done
for
this
is
fulfilling
my
commandments
and
this
doth
witness
unto
the
father
that
ye
are
willing
to
do
that
which
i
have
commanded
you

and
this
shall
ye
always
do
to
those
who
repent
and
are
baptized
in
my
name
and
ye
shall
do
it
in
remembrance
of
my
blood
which
i
have
shed
for
you
that
ye
may
witness
unto
the
father
that
ye
do
always
remember
me
and
if
ye
do
always
remember
me
ye
shall
have
my
spirit
to
be
with
you

and
i
give
unto
you
a
commandment
that
ye
shall
do
these
things
and
if
ye
shall
always
do
these
things
blessed
are
ye
for
ye
are
built
upon
my
rock

but
whoso
among
you
shall
do
more
or
less
than
these
are
not
built
upon
my
rock
but
are
built
upon
a
sandy
foundation
and
when
the
rain
descends
and
the
floods
come
and
the
winds
blow
and
beat
upon
them
they
shall
fall
and
the
gates
of
hell
are
ready
open
to
receive
them

therefore
blessed
are
ye
if
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
which
the
father
hath
commanded
me
that
i
should
give
unto
you

verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
ye
must
watch
and
pray
always
lest
ye
be
tempted
by
the
devil
and
ye
be
led
away
captive
by
him

and
as
i
have
prayed
among
you
even
so
shall
ye
pray
in
my
church
among
my
people
who
do
repent
and
are
baptized
in
my
name
behold
i
am
the
light
i
have
set
an
example
for
you

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
spoken
these
words
unto
his
disciples
he
turned
again
unto
the
multitude
and
said
unto
them

behold
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
ye
must
watch
and
pray
always
lest
ye
enter
into
temptation
for
satan
desireth
to
have
you
that
he
may
sift
you
as
wheat

therefore
ye
must
always
pray
unto
the
father
in
my
name

and
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
the
father
in
my
name
which
is
right
believing
that
ye
shall
receive
behold
it
shall
be
given
unto
you

pray
in
your
families
unto
the
father
always
in
my
name
that
your
wives
and
your
children
may
be
blessed

and
behold
ye
shall
meet
together
oft
and
ye
shall
not
forbid
any
man
from
coming
unto
you
when
ye
shall
meet
together
but
suffer
them
that
they
may
come
unto
you
and
forbid
them
not

but
ye
shall
pray
for
them
and
shall
not
cast
them
out
and
if
it
so
be
that
they
come
unto
you
oft
ye
shall
pray
for
them
unto
the
father
in
my
name

therefore
hold
up
your
light
that
it
may
shine
unto
the
world
behold
i
am
the
light
which
ye
shall
hold
upthat
which
ye
have
seen
me
do
behold
ye
see
that
i
have
prayed
unto
the
father
and
ye
all
have
witnessed

and
ye
see
that
i
have
commanded
that
none
of
you
should
go
away
but
rather
have
commanded
that
ye
should
come
unto
me
that
ye
might
feel
and
see
even
so
shall
ye
do
unto
the
world
and
whosoever
breaketh
this
commandment
suffereth
himself
to
be
led
into
temptation

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
spoken
these
words
he
turned
his
eyes
again
upon
the
disciples
whom
he
had
chosen
and
said
unto
them

behold
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
i
give
unto
you
another
commandment
and
then
i
must
go
unto
my
father
that
i
may
fulfil
other
commandments
which
he
hath
given
me

and
now
behold
this
is
the
commandment
which
i
give
unto
you
that
ye
shall
not
suffer
any
one
knowingly
to
partake
of
my
flesh
and
blood
unworthily
when
ye
shall
minister
it

for
whoso
eateth
and
drinketh
my
flesh
and
blood
unworthily
eateth
and
drinketh
damnation
to
his
soul
therefore
if
ye
know
that
a
man
is
unworthy
to
eat
and
drink
of
my
flesh
and
blood
ye
shall
forbid
him

nevertheless
ye
shall
not
cast
him
out
from
among
you
but
ye
shall
minister
unto
him
and
shall
pray
for
him
unto
the
father
in
my
name
and
if
it
so
be
that
he
repenteth
and
is
baptized
in
my
name
then
shall
ye
receive
him
and
shall
minister
unto
him
of
my
flesh
and
blood

but
if
he
repent
not
he
shall
not
be
numbered
among
my
people
that
he
may
not
destroy
my
people
for
behold
i
know
my
sheep
and
they
are
numbered

nevertheless
ye
shall
not
cast
him
out
of
your
synagogues
or
your
places
of
worship
for
unto
such
shall
ye
continue
to
minister
for
ye
know
not
but
what
they
will
return
and
repent
and
come
unto
me
with
full
purpose
of
heart
and
i
shall
heal
them
and
ye
shall
be
the
means
of
bringing
salvation
unto
them

therefore
keep
these
sayings
which
i
have
commanded
you
that
ye
come
not
under
condemnation
for
wo
unto
him
whom
the
father
condemneth

and
i
give
you
these
commandments
because
of
the
disputations
which
have
been
among
you
and
blessed
are
ye
if
ye
have
no
disputations
among
you

and
now
i
go
unto
the
father
because
it
is
expedient
that
i
should
go
unto
the
father
for
your
sakes

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
made
an
end
of
these
sayings
he
touched
with
his
hand
the
disciples
whom
he
had
chosen
one
by
one
even
until
he
had
touched
them
all
and
spake
unto
them
as
he
touched
them

and
the
multitude
heard
not
the
words
which
he
spake
therefore
they
did
not
bear
record
but
the
disciples
bare
record
that
he
gave
them
power
to
give
the
holy
ghost
and
i
will
show
unto
you
hereafter
that
this
record
is
true

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
touched
them
all
there
came
a
cloud
and
overshadowed
the
multitude
that
they
could
not
see
jesus

and
while
they
were
overshadowed
he
departed
from
them
and
ascended
into
heaven
and
the
disciples
saw
and
did
bear
record
that
he
ascended
again
into
heaven

nephi
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
ascended
into
heaven
the
multitude
did
disperse
and
every
man
did
take
his
wife
and
his
children
and
did
return
to
his
own
home

and
it
was
noised
abroad
among
the
people
immediately
before
it
was
yet
dark
that
the
multitude
had
seen
jesus
and
that
he
had
ministered
unto
them
and
that
he
would
also
show
himself
on
the
morrow
unto
the
multitude

yea
and
even
all
the
night
it
was
noised
abroad
concerning
jesus
and
insomuch
did
they
send
forth
unto
the
people
that
there
were
many
yea
an
exceedingly
great
number
did
labor
exceedingly
all
that
night
that
they
might
be
on
the
morrow
in
the
place
where
jesus
should
show
himself
unto
the
multitude

and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
when
the
multitude
was
gathered
together
behold
nephi
and
his
brother
whom
he
had
raised
from
the
dead
whose
name
was
timothy
and
also
his
son
whose
name
was
jonas
and
also
mathoni
and
mathonihah
his
brother
and
kumen
and
kumenonhi
and
jeremiah
and
shemnon
and
jonas
and
zedekiah
and
isaiahnow
these
were
the
names
of
the
disciples
whom
jesus
had
chosenand
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
forth
and
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
multitude

and
behold
the
multitude
was
so
great
that
they
did
cause
that
they
should
be
separated
into
twelve
bodies

and
the
twelve
did
teach
the
multitude
and
behold
they
did
cause
that
the
multitude
should
kneel
down
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
should
pray
unto
the
father
in
the
name
of
jesus

and
the
disciples
did
pray
unto
the
father
also
in
the
name
of
jesus
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
arose
and
ministered
unto
the
people

and
when
they
had
ministered
those
same
words
which
jesus
had
spokennothing
varying
from
the
words
which
jesus
had
spokenbehold
they
knelt
again
and
prayed
to
the
father
in
the
name
of
jesus

and
they
did
pray
for
that
which
they
most
desired
and
they
desired
that
the
holy
ghost
should
be
given
unto
them

and
when
they
had
thus
prayed
they
went
down
unto
the
waters
edge
and
the
multitude
followed
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephi
went
down
into
the
water
and
was
baptized

and
he
came
up
out
of
the
water
and
began
to
baptize
and
he
baptized
all
those
whom
jesus
had
chosen

and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
were
all
baptized
and
had
come
up
out
of
the
water
the
holy
ghost
did
fall
upon
them
and
they
were
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
and
with
fire

and
behold
they
were
encircled
about
as
if
it
were
by
fire
and
it
came
down
from
heaven
and
the
multitude
did
witness
it
and
did
bear
record
and
angels
did
come
down
out
of
heaven
and
did
minister
unto
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
while
the
angels
were
ministering
unto
the
disciples
behold
jesus
came
and
stood
in
the
midst
and
ministered
unto
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
spake
unto
the
multitude
and
commanded
them
that
they
should
kneel
down
again
upon
the
earth
and
also
that
his
disciples
should
kneel
down
upon
the
earth

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
all
knelt
down
upon
the
earth
he
commanded
his
disciples
that
they
should
pray

and
behold
they
began
to
pray
and
they
did
pray
unto
jesus
calling
him
their
lord
and
their
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
jesus
departed
out
of
the
midst
of
them
and
went
a
little
way
off
from
them
and
bowed
himself
to
the
earth
and
he
said

father
i
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
given
the
holy
ghost
unto
these
whom
i
have
chosen
and
it
is
because
of
their
belief
in
me
that
i
have
chosen
them
out
of
the
world

father
i
pray
thee
that
thou
wilt
give
the
holy
ghost
unto
all
them
that
shall
believe
in
their
words

father
thou
hast
given
them
the
holy
ghost
because
they
believe
in
me
and
thou
seest
that
they
believe
in
me
because
thou
hearest
them
and
they
pray
unto
me
and
they
pray
unto
me
because
i
am
with
them

and
now
father
i
pray
unto
thee
for
them
and
also
for
all
those
who
shall
believe
on
their
words
that
they
may
believe
in
me
that
i
may
be
in
them
as
thou
father
art
in
me
that
we
may
be
one

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
thus
prayed
unto
the
father
he
came
unto
his
disciples
and
behold
they
did
still
continue
without
ceasing
to
pray
unto
him
and
they
did
not
multiply
many
words
for
it
was
given
unto
them
what
they
should
pray
and
they
were
filled
with
desire

and
it
came
to
pass
that
jesus
blessed
them
as
they
did
pray
unto
him
and
his
countenance
did
smile
upon
them
and
the
light
of
his
countenance
did
shine
upon
them
and
behold
they
were
as
white
as
the
countenance
and
also
the
garments
of
jesus
and
behold
the
whiteness
thereof
did
exceed
all
the
whiteness
yea
even
there
could
be
nothing
upon
earth
so
white
as
the
whiteness
thereof

and
jesus
said
unto
them
pray
on
nevertheless
they
did
not
cease
to
pray

and
he
turned
from
them
again
and
went
a
little
way
off
and
bowed
himself
to
the
earth
and
he
prayed
again
unto
the
father
saying

father
i
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
purified
those
whom
i
have
chosen
because
of
their
faith
and
i
pray
for
them
and
also
for
them
who
shall
believe
on
their
words
that
they
may
be
purified
in
me
through
faith
on
their
words
even
as
they
are
purified
in
me

father
i
pray
not
for
the
world
but
for
those
whom
thou
hast
given
me
out
of
the
world
because
of
their
faith
that
they
may
be
purified
in
me
that
i
may
be
in
them
as
thou
father
art
in
me
that
we
may
be
one
that
i
may
be
glorified
in
them

and
when
jesus
had
spoken
these
words
he
came
again
unto
his
disciples
and
behold
they
did
pray
steadfastly
without
ceasing
unto
him
and
he
did
smile
upon
them
again
and
behold
they
were
white
even
as
jesus

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
went
again
a
little
way
off
and
prayed
unto
the
father

and
tongue
cannot
speak
the
words
which
he
prayed
neither
can
be
written
by
man
the
words
which
he
prayed

and
the
multitude
did
hear
and
do
bear
record
and
their
hearts
were
open
and
they
did
understand
in
their
hearts
the
words
which
he
prayed

nevertheless
so
great
and
marvelous
were
the
words
which
he
prayed
that
they
cannot
be
written
neither
can
they
be
uttered
by
man

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
made
an
end
of
praying
he
came
again
to
the
disciples
and
said
unto
them
so
great
faith
have
i
never
seen
among
all
the
jews
wherefore
i
could
not
show
unto
them
so
great
miracles
because
of
their
unbelief

verily
i
say
unto
you
there
are
none
of
them
that
have
seen
so
great
things
as
ye
have
seen
neither
have
they
heard
so
great
things
as
ye
have
heard

chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
commanded
the
multitude
that
they
should
cease
to
pray
and
also
his
disciples
and
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
not
cease
to
pray
in
their
hearts

and
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
arise
and
stand
up
upon
their
feet
and
they
arose
up
and
stood
upon
their
feet

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
brake
bread
again
and
blessed
it
and
gave
to
the
disciples
to
eat

and
when
they
had
eaten
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
break
bread
and
give
unto
the
multitude

and
when
they
had
given
unto
the
multitude
he
also
gave
them
wine
to
drink
and
commanded
them
that
they
should
give
unto
the
multitude

now
there
had
been
no
bread
neither
wine
brought
by
the
disciples
neither
by
the
multitude

but
he
truly
gave
unto
them
bread
to
eat
and
also
wine
to
drink

and
he
said
unto
them
he
that
eateth
this
bread
eateth
of
my
body
to
his
soul
and
he
that
drinketh
of
this
wine
drinketh
of
my
blood
to
his
soul
and
his
soul
shall
never
hunger
nor
thirst
but
shall
be
filled

now
when
the
multitude
had
all
eaten
and
drunk
behold
they
were
filled
with
the
spirit
and
they
did
cry
out
with
one
voice
and
gave
glory
to
jesus
whom
they
both
saw
and
heard

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
all
given
glory
unto
jesus
he
said
unto
them
behold
now
i
finish
the
commandment
which
the
father
hath
commanded
me
concerning
this
people
who
are
a
remnant
of
the
house
of
israel

ye
remember
that
i
spake
unto
you
and
said
that
when
the
words
of
isaiah
should
be
fulfilledbehold
they
are
written
ye
have
them
before
you
therefore
search
them

and
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
when
they
shall
be
fulfilled
then
is
the
fulfilling
of
the
covenant
which
the
father
hath
made
unto
his
people
o
house
of
israel

and
then
shall
the
remnants
which
shall
be
scattered
abroad
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
be
gathered
in
from
the
east
and
from
the
west
and
from
the
south
and
from
the
north
and
they
shall
be
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
their
god
who
hath
redeemed
them

and
the
father
hath
commanded
me
that
i
should
give
unto
you
this
land
for
your
inheritance

and
i
say
unto
you
that
if
the
gentiles
do
not
repent
after
the
blessing
which
they
shall
receive
after
they
have
scattered
my
people

then
shall
ye
who
are
a
remnant
of
the
house
of
jacob
go
forth
among
them
and
ye
shall
be
in
the
midst
of
them
who
shall
be
many
and
ye
shall
be
among
them
as
a
lion
among
the
beasts
of
the
forest
and
as
a
young
lion
among
the
flocks
of
sheep
who
if
he
goeth
through
both
treadeth
down
and
teareth
in
pieces
and
none
can
deliver

thy
hand
shall
be
lifted
up
upon
thine
adversaries
and
all
thine
enemies
shall
be
cut
off

and
i
will
gather
my
people
together
as
a
man
gathereth
his
sheaves
into
the
floor

for
i
will
make
my
people
with
whom
the
father
hath
covenanted
yea
i
will
make
thy
horn
iron
and
i
will
make
thy
hoofs
brass
and
thou
shalt
beat
in
pieces
many
people
and
i
will
consecrate
their
gain
unto
the
lord
and
their
substance
unto
the
lord
of
the
whole
earth
and
behold
i
am
he
who
doeth
it

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
saith
the
father
that
the
sword
of
my
justice
shall
hang
over
them
at
that
day
and
except
they
repent
it
shall
fall
upon
them
saith
the
father
yea
even
upon
all
the
nations
of
the
gentiles

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
i
will
establish
my
people
o
house
of
israel

and
behold
this
people
will
i
establish
in
this
land
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
covenant
which
i
made
with
your
father
jacob
and
it
shall
be
a
new
jerusalem
and
the
powers
of
heaven
shall
be
in
the
midst
of
this
people
yea
even
i
will
be
in
the
midst
of
you

behold
i
am
he
of
whom
moses
spake
saying
a
prophet
shall
the
lord
your
god
raise
up
unto
you
of
your
brethren
like
unto
me
him
shall
ye
hear
in
all
things
whatsoever
he
shall
say
unto
you
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
every
soul
who
will
not
hear
that
prophet
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
the
people

verily
i
say
unto
you
yea
and
all
the
prophets
from
samuel
and
those
that
follow
after
as
many
as
have
spoken
have
testified
of
me

and
behold
ye
are
the
children
of
the
prophets
and
ye
are
of
the
house
of
israel
and
ye
are
of
the
covenant
which
the
father
made
with
your
fathers
saying
unto
abraham
and
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
be
blessed

the
father
having
raised
me
up
unto
you
first
and
sent
me
to
bless
you
in
turning
away
every
one
of
you
from
his
iniquities
and
this
because
ye
are
the
children
of
the
covenant

and
after
that
ye
were
blessed
then
fulfilleth
the
father
the
covenant
which
he
made
with
abraham
saying
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
be
blessedunto
the
pouring
out
of
the
holy
ghost
through
me
upon
the
gentiles
which
blessing
upon
the
gentiles
shall
make
them
mighty
above
all
unto
the
scattering
of
my
people
o
house
of
israel

and
they
shall
be
a
scourge
unto
the
people
of
this
land
nevertheless
when
they
shall
have
received
the
fulness
of
my
gospel
then
if
they
shall
harden
their
hearts
against
me
i
will
return
their
iniquities
upon
their
own
heads
saith
the
father

and
i
will
remember
the
covenant
which
i
have
made
with
my
people
and
i
have
covenanted
with
them
that
i
would
gather
them
together
in
mine
own
due
time
that
i
would
give
unto
them
again
the
land
of
their
fathers
for
their
inheritance
which
is
the
land
of
jerusalem
which
is
the
promised
land
unto
them
forever
saith
the
father

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
time
cometh
when
the
fulness
of
my
gospel
shall
be
preached
unto
them

and
they
shall
believe
in
me
that
i
am
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
and
shall
pray
unto
the
father
in
my
name

then
shall
their
watchmen
lift
up
their
voice
and
with
the
voice
together
shall
they
sing
for
they
shall
see
eye
to
eye

then
will
the
father
gather
them
together
again
and
give
unto
them
jerusalem
for
the
land
of
their
inheritance

then
shall
they
break
forth
into
joysing
together
ye
waste
places
of
jerusalem
for
the
father
hath
comforted
his
people
he
hath
redeemed
jerusalem

the
father
hath
made
bare
his
holy
arm
in
the
eyes
of
all

nations
and
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
shall
see
the
salvation
of
the
father
and
the
father
and
i
are
one

and
then
shall
be
brought
to
pass
that
which
is
written
awake
awake
again
and
put
on
thy
strength
o
zion
put
on
thy
beautiful
garments
o
jerusalem

holy
city
for
henceforth
there
shall
no
more
come
into
thee

uncircumcised
and
the
unclean

shake
thyself
from
the
dust
arise
sit
down
o
jerusalem
loose
thyself
from
the
bands
of
thy
neck
o
captive
daughter
of

for
thus
saith
the
lord
ye
have
sold
yourselves
for
naught
and
ye
shall
be
redeemed
without
money

verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
my
people
shall
know
my
name
yea
in
that
day
they
shall
know
that
i
am
he
that
doth
speak

and
then
shall
they
say
how
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
are
the
feet
of
him
that
bringeth
good
tidings
unto
them
that
publisheth
peace
that
bringeth
good

unto
them
of
good
that
publisheth
salvation
that
saith
unto
zion

reigneth

and
then
shall

which
is
unclean

out
of
the
midst

the
vessels
of
the

for
ye
shall
not
go
out
with
haste
nor
go
by
flight
for
the
lord
will
go
before
you
and
the
god
of
israel
shall
be
your
rearward

behold
my

deal
prudently
he
shall
be
exalted
and
extolled
and
be
very
high

as
many
were
astonished
at
theehis
visage
was
so
marred
more
than
any
man
and
his
form
more
than
the
sons
of

so
shall
he
sprinkle
many
nations
the
kings
shall
shut
their
mouths
at
him
for
that
which

hath
commanded
me
then

covenant
which
the

hath
covenanted
with

and
verily
i
say
unto
you
i
give
unto
you
a
sign
that
ye
may
know
the
time
when
these
things
shall
be
about
to
take
placethat
i
shall
gather
in
from
their
long
dispersion
my
people
o
house
of
israel
and
shall
establish
again
among
them
my
zion

and
behold
this
is
the
thing
which
i
will
give
unto
you
for
a
signfor
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
when
these
things
which
i
declare
unto
you
and
which
i
shall
declare
unto
you
hereafter
of
myself
and
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
which
shall
be
given
unto
you
of
the
father
shall
be
made
known
unto
the
gentiles
that
they
may
know
concerning
this
people
who
are
a
remnant
of
the
house
of
jacob
and
concerning
this
my
people
who
shall
be
scattered
by
them

verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
when
these
things
shall
be
made
known
unto
them
of
the
father
and
shall
come
forth
of
the
father
from
them
unto
you

for
it
is
wisdom
in
the
father
that
they
should
be
established
in
this
land
and
be
set
up
as
a
free
people
by
the
power
of
the
father
that
these
things
might
come
forth
from
them
unto
a
remnant
of
your
seed
that
the
covenant
of
the
father
may
be
fulfilled
which
he
hath
covenanted
with
his
people
o
house
of
israel

therefore
when
these
works
and
the
works
which
shall
be
wrought
among
you
hereafter
shall
come
forth
from
the
gentiles
unto
your
seed
which
shall
dwindle
in
unbelief
because
of
iniquity

for
thus
it
behooveth
the
father
that
it
should
come
forth
from
the
gentiles
that
he
may
show
forth
his
power
unto
the
gentiles
for
this
cause
that
the
gentiles
if
they
will
not
harden
their
hearts
that
they
may
repent
and
come
unto
me
and
be
baptized
in
my
name
and
know
of
the
true
points
of
my
doctrine
that
they
may
be
numbered
among
my
people
o
house
of
israel

and
when
these
things
come
to
pass
that
thy
seed
shall
begin
to
know
these
thingsit
shall
be
a
sign
unto
them
that
they
may
know
that
the
work
of
the
father
hath
already
commenced
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
covenant
which
he
hath
made
unto
the
people
who
are
of
the
house
of
israel

and
when
that
day
shall
come
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
kings
shall
shut
their
mouths
for
that
which
had
not
been
told
them
shall
they
see
and
that
which
they
had
not
heard
shall
they
consider

for
in
that
day
for
my
sake
shall
the
father
work
a
work
which
shall
be
a
great
and
a
marvelous
work
among
them
and
there
shall
be
among
them
those
who
will
not
believe
it
although
a
man
shall
declare
it
unto
them

but
behold
the
life
of
my
servant
shall
be
in
my
hand
therefore
they
shall
not
hurt
him
although
he
shall
be
marred
because
of
them
yet
i
will
heal
him
for
i
will
show
unto
them
that
my
wisdom
is
greater
than
the
cunning
of
the
devil

therefore
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whosoever
will
not
believe
in
my
words
who
am
jesus
christ
which
the
father
shall
cause
him
to
bring
forth
unto
the
gentiles
and
shall
give
unto
him
power
that
he
shall
bring
them
forth
unto
the
gentiles
it
shall
be
done
even
as
moses
said
they
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
my
people
who
are
of
the
covenant

and
my
people
who
are
a
remnant
of
jacob
shall
be
among
the
gentiles
yea
in
the
midst
of
them
as
a
lion
among
the
beasts
of
the
forest
as
a
young
lion
among
the
flocks
of
sheep
who
if
he
go
through
both
treadeth
down
and
teareth
in
pieces
and
none
can
deliver

their
hand
shall
be
lifted
up
upon
their
adversaries
and
all
their
enemies
shall
be
cut
off

yea
wo
be
unto
the
gentiles
except
they
repent
for
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
saith
the
father
that
i
will
cut
off
thy
horses
out
of
the
midst
of
thee
and
i
will
destroy
thy
chariots

and
i
will
cut
off
the
cities
of
thy
land
and
throw
down
all
thy
strongholds

and
i
will
cut
off
witchcrafts
out
of
thy
land
and
thou
shalt
have
no
more
soothsayers

thy
graven
images
i
will
also
cut
off
and
thy
standing
images
out
of
the
midst
of
thee
and
thou
shalt
no
more
worship
the
works
of
thy
hands

and
i
will
pluck
up
thy
groves
out
of
the
midst
of
thee
so
will
i
destroy
thy
cities

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
all
lyings
and
deceivings
and
envyings
and
strifes
and
priestcrafts
and
whoredoms
shall
be
done
away

for
it
shall
come
to
pass
saith
the
father
that
at
that
day
whosoever
will
not
repent
and
come
unto
my
beloved
son
them
will
i
cut
off
from
among
my
people
o
house
of
israel

and
i
will
execute
vengeance
and
fury
upon
them
even
as
upon
the
heathen
such
as
they
have
not
heard

but
if
they
will
repent
and
hearken
unto
my
words
and
harden
not
their
hearts
i
will
establish
my
church
among
them
and
they
shall
come
in
unto
the
covenant
and
be
numbered
among
this
the
remnant
of
jacob
unto
whom
i
have
given
this
land
for
their
inheritance

and
they

aloud
thou

enlarge

stretch
forth
the

forsaken
and
grieved
in

and
a
wife
of

when
thou
wast

saith
thy

for

but
with
great

will
i
gather
thee

in
a
little
wrath
i
hid
my
face
from
thee
for

with
everlasting
kindness
will
i
have
mercy
on
thee
saith

unto

for
as
i
have

that
the

should
no

so
have
i
sworn
that
i
would
not

wroth
with
thee

for
the

tossed
with
tempest
and
not

behold
i

lay
thy

with

i
will
make

behold
they
shall
surely
gather
together
against
thee
not
by
me
whosoever
shall
gather
together
against

shall
fall
for

behold
i
have
created
the
smith
that
bloweth

i

nephi
chapter


and
now
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
ye
ought
to
search
these
things
yea
a
commandment
i
give
unto
you
that
ye
search
these
things
diligently
for
great
are
the
words
of
isaiah

for
surely
he
spake
as
touching
all
things
concerning
my
people
which
are
of
the
house
of
israel
therefore
it
must
needs
be
that
he
must
speak
also
to
the
gentiles

and
all
things
that
he
spake
have
been
and
shall
be
even
according
to
the
words
which
he
spake

therefore
give
heed
to
my
words
write
the
things
which
i
have
told
you
and
according
to
the
time
and
the
will
of
the
father
they
shall
go
forth
unto
the
gentiles

and
whosoever
will
hearken
unto
my
words
and
repenteth
and
is
baptized
the
same
shall
be
saved
search
the
prophets
for
many
there
be
that
testify
of
these
things

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
said
these
words
he
said
unto
them
again
after
he
had
expounded
all
the
scriptures
unto
them
which
they
had
received
he
said
unto
them
behold
other
scriptures
i
would
that
ye
should
write
that
ye
have
not

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
unto
nephi
bring
forth
the
record
which
ye
have
kept

and
when
nephi
had
brought
forth
the
records
and
laid
them
before
him
he
cast
his
eyes
upon
them
and
said

verily
i
say
unto
you
i
commanded
my
servant
samuel
the
lamanite
that
he
should
testify
unto
this
people
that
at
the
day
that
the
father
should
glorify
his
name
in
me
that
there
were
many
saints
who
should
arise
from
the
dead
and
should
appear
unto
many
and
should
minister
unto
them
and
he
said
unto
them
was
it
not
so

and
his
disciples
answered
him
and
said
yea
lord
samuel
did
prophesy
according
to
thy
words
and
they
were
all
fulfilled

and
jesus
said
unto
them
how
be
it
that
ye
have
not
written
this
thing
that
many
saints
did
arise
and
appear
unto
many
and
did
minister
unto
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephi
remembered
that
this
thing
had
not
been
written

and
it
came
to
pass
that
jesus
commanded
that
it
should
be
written
therefore
it
was
written
according
as
he
commanded

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
expounded
all
the
scriptures
in
one
which
they
had
written
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
teach
the
things
which
he
had
expounded
unto
them

nephi
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
write
the
words
which
the
father
had
given
unto
malachi
which
he
should
tell
unto
them
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
they
were
written
he
expounded
them
and
these
are
the
words
which
he
did
tell
unto
them
saying
thus
said
the
father
unto
malachibehold
i
will
send
my
messenger
and
he
shall
prepare
the
way
before
me
and
the
lord
whom
ye
seek
shall
suddenly
come
to
his
temple
even
the
messenger
of
the
covenant
whom
ye
delight
in
behold
he
shall
come
saith
the
lord
of
hosts

but
who
may
abide
the
day
of
his
coming
and
who
shall
stand
when
he
appeareth
for
he
is
like
a
refiners
fire
and
like
fullers
soap

and
he
shall
sit
as
a
refiner
and
purifier
of
silver
and
he
shall
purify
the
sons
of
levi
and
purge
them
as
gold
and
silver
that
they
may
offer
unto
the
lord
an
offering
in
righteousness

then
shall
the
offering
of
judah
and
jerusalem
be
pleasant
unto
the
lord
as
in
the
days
of
old
and
as
in
former
years

and
i
will
come
near
to
you
to
judgment
and
i
will
be
a
swift
witness
against
the
sorcerers
and
against
the
adulterers
and
against
false
swearers
and
against
those
that
oppress
the
hireling
in
his
wages
the
widow
and
the
fatherless
and
that
turn
aside
the
stranger
and
fear
not
me
saith
the
lord
of
hosts

for
i
am
the
lord
i
change
not
therefore
ye
sons
of
jacob
are
not
consumed

even
from
the
days
of
your
fathers
ye
are
gone
away
from
mine
ordinances
and
have
not
kept
them
return
unto
me
and
i
will
return
unto
you
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
but
ye
say
wherein
shall
we
return

will
a
man
rob
god
yet
ye
have
robbed
me
but
ye
say
wherein
have
we
robbed
thee
in
tithes
and
offerings

ye
are
cursed
with
a
curse
for
ye
have
robbed
me
even
this
whole
nation

bring
ye
all
the
tithes
into
the
storehouse
that
there
may
be
meat
in
my
house
and
prove
me
now
herewith
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
if
i
will
not
open
you
the
windows
of
heaven
and
pour
you
out
a
blessing
that
there
shall
not
be
room
enough
to
receive
it

and
i
will
rebuke
the
devourer
for
your
sakes
and
he
shall
not
destroy
the
fruits
of
your
ground
neither
shall
your
vine
cast
her
fruit
before
the
time
in
the
fields
saith
the
lord
of
hosts

and
all
nations
shall
call
you
blessed
for
ye
shall
be
a
delightsome
land
saith
the
lord
of
hosts

your
words
have
been
stout
against
me
saith
the
lord
yet
ye
say
what
have
we
spoken
against
thee

ye
have
said
it
is
vain
to
serve
god
and
what
doth
it
profit
that
we
have
kept
his
ordinances
and
that
we
have
walked
mournfully
before
the
lord
of
hosts

and
now
we
call
the
proud
happy
yea
they
that
work
wickedness
are
set
up
yea
they
that
tempt
god
are
even
delivered

then
they
that
feared
the
lord
spake
often
one
to
another
and
the
lord
hearkened
and
heard
and
a
book
of
remembrance
was
written
before
him
for
them
that
feared
the
lord
and
that
thought
upon
his
name

and
they
shall
be
mine
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
in
that
day
when
i
make
up
my
jewels
and
i
will
spare
them
as
a
man
spareth
his
own
son
that
serveth
him

then
shall
ye
return
and
discern
between
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
between
him
that
serveth
god
and
him
that
serveth
him
not

for
behold
the
day
cometh
that
shall
burn
as
an
oven
and
all
the
proud
yea
and
all
that
do
wickedly
shall
be
stubble
and
the
day
that
cometh
shall
burn
them
up
saith
the
lord
of

that
it
shall
leave
them
neither
root
nor

but
unto
you
that
fear
my

shall
the

arise
with
healing
in
his
wings
and
ye
shall
go
forth
and
grow
up
as

in

ye
shall
tread
down
the
wicked
for
they

nephi
chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
told
these
things
he
expounded
them
unto
the
multitude
and
he
did
expound
all
things
unto
them
both
great
and
small

and
he
saith
these
scriptures
which
ye
had
not
with
you
the
father
commanded
that
i
should
give
unto
you
for
it
was
wisdom
in
him
that
they
should
be
given
unto
future
generations

and
he
did
expound
all
things
even
from
the
beginning
until
the
time
that
he
should
come
in
his
gloryyea
even
all
things
which
should
come
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
even
until
the
elements
should
melt
with
fervent
heat
and
the
earth
should
be
wrapt
together
as
a
scroll
and
the
heavens
and
the
earth
should
pass
away

and
even
unto
the
great
and
last
day
when
all
people
and
all
kindreds
and
all
nations
and
tongues
shall
stand
before
god
to
be
judged
of
their
works
whether
they
be
good
or
whether
they
be
evil

if
they
be
good
to
the
resurrection
of
everlasting
life
and
if
they
be
evil
to
the
resurrection
of
damnation
being
on
a
parallel
the
one
on
the
one
hand
and
the
other
on
the
other
hand
according
to
the
mercy
and
the
justice
and
the
holiness
which
is
in
christ
who
was
before
the
world
began

and
now
there
cannot
be
written
in
this
book
even
a
hundredth
part
of
the
things
which
jesus
did
truly
teach
unto
the
people

but
behold
the
plates
of
nephi
do
contain
the
more
part
of
the
things
which
he
taught
the
people

and
these
things
have
i
written
which
are
a
lesser
part
of
the
things
which
he
taught
the
people
and
i
have
written
them
to
the
intent
that
they
may
be
brought
again
unto
this
people
from
the
gentiles
according
to
the
words
which
jesus
hath
spoken

and
when
they
shall
have
received
this
which
is
expedient
that
they
should
have
first
to
try
their
faith
and
if
it
shall
so
be
that
they
shall
believe
these
things
then
shall
the
greater
things
be
made
manifest
unto
them

and
if
it
so
be
that
they
will
not
believe
these
things
then
shall
the
greater
things
be
withheld
from
them
unto
their
condemnation

behold
i
was
about
to
write
them
all
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
nephi
but
the
lord
forbade
it
saying
i
will
try
the
faith
of
my
people

therefore
i
mormon
do
write
the
things
which
have
been
commanded
me
of
the
lord
and
now
i
mormon
make
an
end
of
my
sayings
and
proceed
to
write
the
things
which
have
been
commanded
me

therefore
i
would
that
ye
should
behold
that
the
lord
truly
did
teach
the
people
for
the
space
of
three
days
and
after
that
he
did
show
himself
unto
them
oft
and
did
break
bread
oft
and
bless
it
and
give
it
unto
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
teach
and
minister
unto
the
children
of
the
multitude
of
whom
hath
been
spoken
and
he
did
loose
their
tongues
and
they
did
speak
unto
their
fathers
great
and
marvelous
things
even
greater
than
he
had
revealed
unto
the
people
and
he
loosed
their
tongues
that
they
could
utter

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
he
had
ascended
into
heaventhe
second
time
that
he
showed
himself
unto
them
and
had
gone
unto
the
father
after
having
healed
all
their
sick
and
their
lame
and
opened
the
eyes
of
their
blind
and
unstopped
the
ears
of
the
deaf
and
even
had
done
all
manner
of
cures
among
them
and
raised
a
man
from
the
dead
and
had
shown
forth
his
power
unto
them
and
had
ascended
unto
the
father

behold
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
the
multitude
gathered
themselves
together
and
they
both
saw
and
heard
these
children
yea
even
babes
did
open
their
mouths
and
utter
marvelous
things
and
the
things
which
they
did
utter
were
forbidden
that
there
should
not
any
man
write
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
disciples
whom
jesus
had
chosen
began
from
that
time
forth
to
baptize
and
to
teach
as
many
as
did
come
unto
them
and
as
many
as
were
baptized
in
the
name
of
jesus
were
filled
with
the
holy
ghost

and
many
of
them
saw
and
heard
unspeakable
things
which
are
not
lawful
to
be
written

and
they
taught
and
did
minister
one
to
another
and
they
had
all
things
common
among
them
every
man
dealing
justly
one
with
another

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
do
all
things
even
as
jesus
had
commanded
them

and
they
who
were
baptized
in
the
name
of
jesus
were
called
the
church
of
christ

nephi
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
the
disciples
of
jesus
were
journeying
and
were
preaching
the
things
which
they
had
both
heard
and
seen
and
were
baptizing
in
the
name
of
jesus
it
came
to
pass
that
the
disciples
were
gathered
together
and
were
united
in
mighty
prayer
and
fasting

and
jesus
again
showed
himself
unto
them
for
they
were
praying
unto
the
father
in
his
name
and
jesus
came
and
stood
in
the
midst
of
them
and
said
unto
them
what
will
ye
that
i
shall
give
unto
you

and
they
said
unto
him
lord
we
will
that
thou
wouldst
tell
us
the
name
whereby
we
shall
call
this
church
for
there
are
disputations
among
the
people
concerning
this
matter

and
the
lord
said
unto
them
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
why
is
it
that
the
people
should
murmur
and
dispute
because
of
this
thing

have
they
not
read
the
scriptures
which
say
ye
must
take
upon
you
the
name
of
christ
which
is
my
name
for
by
this
name
shall
ye
be
called
at
the
last
day

and
whoso
taketh
upon
him
my
name
and
endureth
to
the
end
the
same
shall
be
saved
at
the
last
day

therefore
whatsoever
ye
shall
do
ye
shall
do
it
in
my
name
therefore
ye
shall
call
the
church
in
my
name
and
ye
shall
call
upon
the
father
in
my
name
that
he
will
bless
the
church
for
my
sake

and
how
be
it
my
church
save
it
be
called
in
my
name
for
if
a
church
be
called
in
moses
name
then
it
be
moses
church
or
if
it
be
called
in
the
name
of
a
man
then
it
be
the
church
of
a
man
but
if
it
be
called
in
my
name
then
it
is
my
church
if
it
so
be
that
they
are
built
upon
my
gospel

verily
i
say
unto
you
that
ye
are
built
upon
my
gospel
therefore
ye
shall
call
whatsoever
things
ye
do
call
in
my
name
therefore
if
ye
call
upon
the
father
for
the
church
if
it
be
in
my
name
the
father
will
hear
you

and
if
it
so
be
that
the
church
is
built
upon
my
gospel
then
will
the
father
show
forth
his
own
works
in
it

but
if
it
be
not
built
upon
my
gospel
and
is
built
upon
the
works
of
men
or
upon
the
works
of
the
devil
verily
i
say
unto
you
they
have
joy
in
their
works
for
a
season
and
by
and
by
the
end
cometh
and
they
are
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
from
whence
there
is
no
return

for
their
works
do
follow
them
for
it
is
because
of
their
works
that
they
are
hewn
down
therefore
remember
the
things
that
i
have
told
you

behold
i
have
given
unto
you
my
gospel
and
this
is
the
gospel
which
i
have
given
unto
youthat
i
came
into
the
world
to
do
the
will
of
my
father
because
my
father
sent
me

and
my
father
sent
me
that
i
might
be
lifted
up
upon
the
cross
and
after
that
i
had
been
lifted
up
upon
the
cross
that
i
might
draw
all
men
unto
me
that
as
i
have
been
lifted
up
by
men
even
so
should
men
be
lifted
up
by
the
father
to
stand
before
me
to
be
judged
of
their
works
whether
they
be
good
or
whether
they
be
evil

and
for
this
cause
have
i
been
lifted
up
therefore
according
to
the
power
of
the
father
i
will
draw
all
men
unto
me
that
they
may
be
judged
according
to
their
works

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whoso
repenteth
and
is
baptized
in
my
name
shall
be
filled
and
if
he
endureth
to
the
end
behold
him
will
i
hold
guiltless
before
my
father
at
that
day
when
i
shall
stand
to
judge
the
world

and
he
that
endureth
not
unto
the
end
the
same
is
he
that
is
also
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
from
whence
they
can
no
more
return
because
of
the
justice
of
the
father

and
this
is
the
word
which
he
hath
given
unto
the
children
of
men
and
for
this
cause
he
fulfilleth
the
words
which
he
hath
given
and
he
lieth
not
but
fulfilleth
all
his
words

and
no
unclean
thing
can
enter
into
his
kingdom
therefore
nothing
entereth
into
his
rest
save
it
be
those
who
have
washed
their
garments
in
my
blood
because
of
their
faith
and
the
repentance
of
all
their
sins
and
their
faithfulness
unto
the
end

now
this
is
the
commandment
repent
all
ye
ends
of
the
earth
and
come
unto
me
and
be
baptized
in
my
name
that
ye
may
be
sanctified
by
the
reception
of
the
holy
ghost
that
ye
may
stand
spotless
before
me
at
the
last
day

verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
this
is
my
gospel
and
ye
know
the
things
that
ye
must
do
in
my
church
for
the
works
which
ye
have
seen
me
do
that
shall
ye
also
do
for
that
which
ye
have
seen
me
do
even
that
shall
ye
do

therefore
if
ye
do
these
things
blessed
are
ye
for
ye
shall
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day

write
the
things
which
ye
have
seen
and
heard
save
it
be
those
which
are
forbidden

write
the
works
of
this
people
which
shall
be
even
as
hath
been
written
of
that
which
hath
been

for
behold
out
of
the
books
which
have
been
written
and
which
shall
be
written
shall
this
people
be
judged
for
by
them
shall
their
works
be
known
unto
men

and
behold
all
things
are
written
by
the
father
therefore
out
of
the
books
which
shall
be
written
shall
the
world
be
judged

and
know
ye
that
ye
shall
be
judges
of
this
people
according
to
the
judgment
which
i
shall
give
unto
you
which
shall
be
just
therefore
what
manner
of
men
ought
ye
to
be
verily
i
say
unto
you
even
as
i
am

and
now
i
go
unto
the
father
and
verily
i
say
unto
you
whatsoever
things
ye
shall
ask
the
father
in
my
name
shall
be
given
unto
you

therefore
ask
and
ye
shall
receive
knock
and
it
shall
be
opened
unto
you
for
he
that
asketh
receiveth
and
unto
him
that
knocketh
it
shall
be
opened

and
now
behold
my
joy
is
great
even
unto
fulness
because
of
you
and
also
this
generation
yea
and
even
the
father
rejoiceth
and
also
all
the
holy
angels
because
of
you
and
this
generation
for
none
of
them
are
lost

behold
i
would
that
ye
should
understand
for
i
mean
them
who
are
now
alive
of
this
generation
and
none
of
them
are
lost
and
in
them
i
have
fulness
of
joy

but
behold
it
sorroweth
me
because
of
the
fourth
generation
from
this
generation
for
they
are
led
away
captive
by
him
even
as
was
the
son
of
perdition
for
they
will
sell
me
for
silver
and
for
gold
and
for
that
which
moth
doth
corrupt
and
which
thieves
can
break
through
and
steal
and
in
that
day
will
i
visit
them
even
in
turning
their
works
upon
their
own
heads

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
ended
these
sayings
he
said
unto
his
disciples
enter
ye
in
at
the
strait
gate
for
strait
is
the
gate
and
narrow
is
the
way
that
leads
to
life
and
few
there
be
that
find
it
but
wide
is
the
gate
and
broad
the
way
which
leads
to
death
and
many
there
be
that
travel
therein
until
the
night
cometh
wherein
no
man
can
work

nephi
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
when
jesus
had
said
these
words
he
spake
unto
his
disciples
one
by
one
saying
unto
them
what
is
it
that
ye
desire
of
me
after
that
i
am
gone
to
the
father

and
they
all
spake
save
it
were
three
saying
we
desire
that
after
we
have
lived
unto
the
age
of
man
that
our
ministry
wherein
thou
hast
called
us
may
have
an
end
that
we
may
speedily
come
unto
thee
in
thy
kingdom

and
he
said
unto
them
blessed
are
ye
because
ye
desired
this
thing
of
me
therefore
after
that
ye
are
seventy
and
two
years
old
ye
shall
come
unto
me
in
my
kingdom
and
with
me
ye
shall
find
rest

and
when
he
had
spoken
unto
them
he
turned
himself
unto
the
three
and
said
unto
them
what
will
ye
that
i
should
do
unto
you
when
i
am
gone
unto
the
father

and
they
sorrowed
in
their
hearts
for
they
durst
not
speak
unto
him
the
things
which
they
desired

and
he
said
unto
them
behold
i
know
your
thoughts
and
ye
have
desired
the
thing
which
john
my
beloved
who
was
with
me
in
my
ministry
before
that
i
was
lifted
up
by
the
jews
desired
of
me

therefore
more
blessed
are
ye
for
ye
shall
never
taste
of
death
but
ye
shall
live
to
behold
all
the
doings
of
the
father
unto
the
children
of
men
even
until
all
things
shall
be
fulfilled
according
to
the
will
of
the
father
when
i
shall
come
in
my
glory
with
the
powers
of
heaven

and
ye
shall
never
endure
the
pains
of
death
but
when
i
shall
come
in
my
glory
ye
shall
be
changed
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
from
mortality
to
immortality
and
then
shall
ye
be
blessed
in
the
kingdom
of
my
father

and
again
ye
shall
not
have
pain
while
ye
shall
dwell
in
the
flesh
neither
sorrow
save
it
be
for
the
sins
of
the
world
and
all
this
will
i
do
because
of
the
thing
which
ye
have
desired
of
me
for
ye
have
desired
that
ye
might
bring
the
souls
of
men
unto
me
while
the
world
shall
stand

and
for
this
cause
ye
shall
have
fulness
of
joy
and
ye
shall
sit
down
in
the
kingdom
of
my
father
yea
your
joy
shall
be
full
even
as
the
father
hath
given
me
fulness
of
joy
and
ye
shall
be
even
as
i
am
and
i
am
even
as
the
father
and
the
father
and
i
are
one

and
the
holy
ghost
beareth
record
of
the
father
and
me
and
the
father
giveth
the
holy
ghost
unto
the
children
of
men
because
of
me

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
spoken
these
words
he
touched
every
one
of
them
with
his
finger
save
it
were
the
three
who
were
to
tarry
and
then
he
departed

and
behold
the
heavens
were
opened
and
they
were
caught
up
into
heaven
and
saw
and
heard
unspeakable
things

and
it
was
forbidden
them
that
they
should
utter
neither
was
it
given
unto
them
power
that
they
could
utter
the
things
which
they
saw
and
heard

and
whether
they
were
in
the
body
or
out
of
the
body
they
could
not
tell
for
it
did
seem
unto
them
like
a
transfiguration
of
them
that
they
were
changed
from
this
body
of
flesh
into
an
immortal
state
that
they
could
behold
the
things
of
god

but
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
again
minister
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
nevertheless
they
did
not
minister
of
the
things
which
they
had
heard
and
seen
because
of
the
commandment
which
was
given
them
in
heaven

and
now
whether
they
were
mortal
or
immortal
from
the
day
of
their
transfiguration
i
know
not

but
this
much
i
know
according
to
the
record
which
hath
been
giventhey
did
go
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
land
and
did
minister
unto
all
the
people
uniting
as
many
to
the
church
as
would
believe
in
their
preaching
baptizing
them
and
as
many
as
were
baptized
did
receive
the
holy
ghost

and
they
were
cast
into
prison
by
them
who
did
not
belong
to
the
church
and
the
prisons
could
not
hold
them
for
they
were
rent
in
twain

and
they
were
cast
down
into
the
earth
but
they
did
smite
the
earth
with
the
word
of
god
insomuch
that
by
his
power
they
were
delivered
out
of
the
depths
of
the
earth
and
therefore
they
could
not
dig
pits
sufficient
to
hold
them

and
thrice
they
were
cast
into
a
furnace
and
received
no
harm

and
twice
were
they
cast
into
a
den
of
wild
beasts
and
behold
they
did
play
with
the
beasts
as
a
child
with
a
suckling
lamb
and
received
no
harm

and
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
they
did
go
forth
among
all
the
people
of
nephi
and
did
preach
the
gospel
of
christ
unto
all
people
upon
the
face
of
the
land
and
they
were
converted
unto
the
lord
and
were
united
unto
the
church
of
christ
and
thus
the
people
of
that
generation
were
blessed
according
to
the
word
of
jesus

and
now
i
mormon
make
an
end
of
speaking
concerning
these
things
for
a
time

behold
i
was
about
to
write
the
names
of
those
who
were
never
to
taste
of
death
but
the
lord
forbade
therefore
i
write
them
not
for
they
are
hid
from
the
world

but
behold
i
have
seen
them
and
they
have
ministered
unto
me

and
behold
they
will
be
among
the
gentiles
and
the
gentiles
shall
know
them
not

they
will
also
be
among
the
jews
and
the
jews
shall
know
them
not

and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
the
lord
seeth
fit
in
his
wisdom
that
they
shall
minister
unto
all
the
scattered
tribes
of
israel
and
unto
all
nations
kindreds
tongues
and
people
and
shall
bring
out
of
them
unto
jesus
many
souls
that
their
desire
may
be
fulfilled
and
also
because
of
the
convincing
power
of
god
which
is
in
them

and
they
are
as
the
angels
of
god
and
if
they
shall
pray
unto
the
father
in
the
name
of
jesus
they
can
show
themselves
unto
whatsoever
man
it
seemeth
them
good

therefore
great
and
marvelous
works
shall
be
wrought
by
them
before
the
great
and
coming
day
when
all
people
must
surely
stand
before
the
judgmentseat
of
christ

yea
even
among
the
gentiles
shall
there
be
a
great
and
marvelous
work
wrought
by
them
before
that
judgment
day

and
if
ye
had
all
the
scriptures
which
give
an
account
of
all
the
marvelous
works
of
christ
ye
would
according
to
the
words
of
christ
know
that
these
things
must
surely
come

and
wo
be
unto
him
that
will
not
hearken
unto
the
words
of
jesus
and
also
to
them
whom
he
hath
chosen
and
sent
among
them
for
whoso
receiveth
not
the
words
of
jesus
and
the
words
of
those
whom
he
hath
sent
receiveth
not
him
and
therefore
he
will
not
receive
them
at
the
last
day

and
it
would
be
better
for
them
if
they
had
not
been
born
for
do
ye
suppose
that
ye
can
get
rid
of
the
justice
of
an
offended
god
who
hath
been
trampled
under
feet
of
men
that
thereby
salvation
might
come

and
now
behold
as
i
spake
concerning
those
whom
the
lord
hath
chosen
yea
even
three
who
were
caught
up
into
the
heavens
that
i
knew
not
whether
they
were
cleansed
from
mortality
to
immortality

but
behold
since
i
wrote
i
have
inquired
of
the
lord
and
he
hath
made
it
manifest
unto
me
that
there
must
needs
be
a
change
wrought
upon
their
bodies
or
else
it
needs
be
that
they
must
taste
of
death

therefore
that
they
might
not
taste
of
death
there
was
a
change
wrought
upon
their
bodies
that
they
might
not
suffer
pain
nor
sorrow
save
it
were
for
the
sins
of
the
world

now
this
change
was
not
equal
to
that
which
shall
take
place
at
the
last
day
but
there
was
a
change
wrought
upon
them
insomuch
that
satan
could
have
no
power
over
them
that
he
could
not
tempt
them
and
they
were
sanctified
in
the
flesh
that
they
were
holy
and
that
the
powers
of
the
earth
could
not
hold
them

nephi

and
in
this
state
they
were
to
remain
until
the
judgment
day
of
christ
and
at
that
day
they
were
to
receive
a
greater
change
and
to
be
received
into
the
kingdom
of
the
father
to
go
no
more
out
but
to
dwell
eternally
in
the
heavens

and
now
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
when
the
lord
shall
see
fit
in
his
wisdom
that
these
sayings
shall
come
unto
the
gentiles
according
to
his
word
then
ye
may
know
that
the
covenant
which
the
father
hath
made
with
the
children
of
israel
concerning
their
restoration
to
the
lands
of
their
inheritance
is
already
beginning
to
be
fulfilled

and
ye
may
know
that
the
words
of
the
lord
which
have
been
spoken
by
the
holy
prophets
shall
all
be
fulfilled
and
ye
need
not
say
that
the
lord
delays
his
coming
unto
the
children
of
israel

and
ye
need
not
imagine
in
your
hearts
that
the
words
which
have
been
spoken
are
vain
for
behold
the
lord
will
remember
his
covenant
which
he
hath
made
unto
his
people
of
the
house
of
israel

and
when
ye
shall
see
these
sayings
coming
forth
among
you
then
ye
need
not
any
longer
spurn
at
the
doings
of
the
lord
for
the
sword
of
his
justice
is
in
his
right
hand
and
behold
at
that
day
if
ye
shall
spurn
at
his
doings
he
will
cause
that
it
shall
soon
overtake
you

wo
unto
him
that
spurneth
at
the
doings
of
the
lord
yea
wo
unto
him
that
shall
deny
the
christ
and
his
works

yea
wo
unto
him
that
shall
deny
the
revelations
of
the
lord
and
that
shall
say
the
lord
no
longer
worketh
by
revelation
or
by
prophecy
or
by
gifts
or
by
tongues
or
by
healings
or
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost

yea
and
wo
unto
him
that
shall
say
at
that
day
to
get
gain
that
there
can
be
no
miracle
wrought
by
jesus
christ
for
he
that
doeth
this
shall
become
like
unto
the
son
of
perdition
for
whom
there
was
no
mercy
according
to
the
word
of
christ

yea
and
ye
need
not
any
longer
hiss
nor
spurn
nor
make
game
of
the
jews
nor
any
of
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
israel
for
behold
the
lord
remembereth
his
covenant
unto
them
and
he
will
do
unto
them
according
to
that
which
he
hath
sworn

therefore
ye
need
not
suppose
that
ye
can
turn
the
right
hand
of
the
lord
unto
the
left
that
he
may
not
execute
judgment
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
covenant
which
he
hath
made
unto
the
house
of
israel

fourth
nephi
who
is
the
son
of
nephione
of
the
disciples
of
jesus
christ
an
account
of
the
people
of
nephi
according
to
his
record

nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
thirty
and
fourth
year
passed
away
and
also
the
thirty
and
fifth
and
behold
the
disciples
of
jesus
had
formed
a
church
of
christ
in
all
the
lands
round
about
and
as
many
as
did
come
unto
them
and
did
truly
repent
of
their
sins
were
baptized
in
the
name
of
jesus
and
they
did
also
receive
the
holy
ghost

nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
thirty
and
sixth
year
the
people
were
all
converted
unto
the
lord
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
both
nephites
and
lamanites
and
there
were
no
contentions
and
disputations
among
them
and
every
man
did
deal
justly
one
with
another

nephi

and
they
had
all
things
common
among
them
therefore
there
were
not
rich
and
poor
bond
and
free
but
they
were
all
made
free
and
partakers
of
the
heavenly
gift

nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
thirty
and
seventh
year
passed
away
also
and
there
still
continued
to
be
peace
in
the
land

nephi

and
there
were
great
and
marvelous
works
wrought
by
the
disciples
of
jesus
insomuch
that
they
did
heal
the
sick
and
raise
the
dead
and
cause
the
lame
to
walk
and
the
blind
to
receive
their
sight
and
the
deaf
to
hear
and
all
manner
of
miracles
did
they
work
among
the
children
of
men
and
in
nothing
did
they
work
miracles
save
it
were
in
the
name
of
jesus

nephi

and
thus
did
the
thirty
and
eighth
year
pass
away
and
also
the
thirty
and
ninth
and
forty
and
first
and
the
forty
and
second
yea
even
until
forty
and
nine
years
had
passed
away
and
also
the
fifty
and
first
and
the
fifty
and
second
yea
and
even
until
fifty
and
nine
years
had
passed
away

nephi

and
the
lord
did
prosper
them
exceedingly
in
the
land
yea
insomuch
that
they
did
build
cities
again
where
there
had
been
cities
burned

nephi

yea
even
that
great
city
zarahemla
did
they
cause
to
be
built
again

nephi

but
there
were
many
cities
which
had
been
sunk
and
waters
came
up
in
the
stead
thereof
therefore
these
cities
could
not
be
renewed

nephi

and
now
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
nephi
did
wax
strong
and
did
multiply
exceedingly
fast
and
became
an
exceedingly
fair
and
delightsome
people

nephi

and
they
were
married
and
given
in
marriage
and
were
blessed
according
to
the
multitude
of
the
promises
which
the
lord
had
made
unto
them

nephi

and
they
did
not
walk
any
more
after
the
performances
and
ordinances
of
the
law
of
moses
but
they
did
walk
after
the
commandments
which
they
had
received
from
their
lord
and
their
god
continuing
in
fasting
and
prayer
and
in
meeting
together
oft
both
to
pray
and
to
hear
the
word
of
the
lord

nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
no
contention
among
all
the
people
in
all
the
land
but
there
were
mighty
miracles
wrought
among
the
disciples
of
jesus

nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
seventy
and
first
year
passed
away
and
also
the
seventy
and
second
year
yea
and
in
fine
till
the
seventy
and
ninth
year
had
passed
away
yea
even
an
hundred
years
had
passed
away
and
the
disciples
of
jesus
whom
he
had
chosen
had
all
gone
to
the
paradise
of
god
save
it
were
the
three
who
should
tarry
and
there
were
other
disciples
ordained
in
their
stead
and
also
many
of
that
generation
had
passed
away

nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
no
contention
in
the
land
because
of
the
love
of
god
which
did
dwell
in
the
hearts
of
the
people

nephi

and
there
were
no
envyings
nor
strifes
nor
tumults
nor
whoredoms
nor
lyings
nor
murders
nor
any
manner
of
lasciviousness
and
surely
there
could
not
be
a
happier
people
among
all
the
people
who
had
been
created
by
the
hand
of
god

nephi

there
were
no
robbers
nor
murderers
neither
were
there
lamanites
nor
any
manner
of
ites
but
they
were
in
one
the
children
of
christ
and
heirs
to
the
kingdom
of
god

nephi

and
how
blessed
were
they
for
the
lord
did
bless
them
in
all
their
doings
yea
even
they
were
blessed
and
prospered
until
an
hundred
and
ten
years
had
passed
away
and
the
first
generation
from
christ
had
passed
away
and
there
was
no
contention
in
all
the
land

nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephi
he
that
kept
this
last
record
and
he
kept
it
upon
the
plates
of
nephi
died
and
his
son
amos
kept
it
in
his
stead
and
he
kept
it
upon
the
plates
of
nephi
also

nephi

and
he
kept
it
eighty
and
four
years
and
there
was
still
peace
in
the
land
save
it
were
a
small
part
of
the
people
who
had
revolted
from
the
church
and
taken
upon
them
the
name
of
lamanites
therefore
there
began
to
be
lamanites
again
in
the
land

nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
amos
died
also
and
it
was
an
hundred
and
ninety
and
four
years
from
the
coming
of
christ
and
his
son
amos
kept
the
record
in
his
stead
and
he
also
kept
it
upon
the
plates
of
nephi
and
it
was
also
written
in
the
book
of
nephi
which
is
this
book

nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
two
hundred
years
had
passed
away
and
the
second
generation
had
all
passed
away
save
it
were
a
few

nephi

and
now
i
mormon
would
that
ye
should
know
that
the
people
had
multiplied
insomuch
that
they
were
spread
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
and
that
they
had
become
exceedingly
rich
because
of
their
prosperity
in
christ

nephi

and
now
in
this
two
hundred
and
first
year
there
began
to
be
among
them
those
who
were
lifted
up
in
pride
such
as
the
wearing
of
costly
apparel
and
all
manner
of
fine
pearls
and
of
the
fine
things
of
the
world

nephi

and
from
that
time
forth
they
did
have
their
goods
and
their
substance
no
more
common
among
them

nephi

and
they
began
to
be
divided
into
classes
and
they
began
to
build
up
churches
unto
themselves
to
get
gain
and
began
to
deny
the
true
church
of
christ

nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
two
hundred
and
ten
years
had
passed
away
there
were
many
churches
in
the
land
yea
there
were
many
churches
which
professed
to
know
the
christ
and
yet
they
did
deny
the
more
parts
of
his
gospel
insomuch
that
they
did
receive
all
manner
of
wickedness
and
did
administer
that
which
was
sacred
unto
him
to
whom
it
had
been
forbidden
because
of
unworthiness

nephi

and
this
church
did
multiply
exceedingly
because
of
iniquity
and
because
of
the
power
of
satan
who
did
get
hold
upon
their
hearts

nephi

and
again
there
was
another
church
which
denied
the
christ
and
they
did
persecute
the
true
church
of
christ
because
of
their
humility
and
their
belief
in
christ
and
they
did
despise
them
because
of
the
many
miracles
which
were
wrought
among
them

nephi

therefore
they
did
exercise
power
and
authority
over
the
disciples
of
jesus
who
did
tarry
with
them
and
they
did
cast
them
into
prison
but
by
the
power
of
the
word
of
god
which
was
in
them
the
prisons
were
rent
in
twain
and
they
went
forth
doing
mighty
miracles
among
them

nephi

nevertheless
and
notwithstanding
all
these
miracles
the
people
did
harden
their
hearts
and
did
seek
to
kill
them
even
as
the
jews
at
jerusalem
sought
to
kill
jesus
according
to
his
word

nephi

and
they
did
cast
them
into
furnaces
of
fire
and
they
came
forth
receiving
no
harm

nephi

and
they
also
cast
them
into
dens
of
wild
beasts
and
they
did
play
with
the
wild
beasts
even
as
a
child
with
a
lamb
and
they
did
come
forth
from
among
them
receiving
no
harm

nephi

nevertheless
the
people
did
harden
their
hearts
for
they
were
led
by
many
priests
and
false
prophets
to
build
up
many
churches
and
to
do
all
manner
of
iniquity
and
they
did
smite
upon
the
people
of
jesus
but
the
people
of
jesus
did
not
smite
again
and
thus
they
did
dwindle
in
unbelief
and
wickedness
from
year
to
year
even
until
two
hundred
and
thirty
years
had
passed
away

nephi

and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
this
year
yea
in
the
two
hundred
and
thirty
and
first
year
there
was
a
great
division
among
the
people

nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
year
there
arose
a
people
who
were
called
the
nephites
and
they
were
true
believers
in
christ
and
among
them
there
were
those
who
were
called
by
the
lamanitesjacobites
and
josephites
and
zoramites

nephi

therefore
the
true
believers
in
christ
and
the
true
worshipers
of
christ
among
whom
were
the
three
disciples
of
jesus
who
should
tarry
were
called
nephites
and
jacobites
and
josephites
and
zoramites

nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
who
rejected
the
gospel
were
called
lamanites
and
lemuelites
and
ishmaelites
and
they
did
not
dwindle
in
unbelief
but
they
did
wilfully
rebel
against
the
gospel
of
christ
and
they
did
teach
their
children
that
they
should
not
believe
even
as
their
fathers
from
the
beginning
did
dwindle

nephi

and
it
was
because
of
the
wickedness
and
abomination
of
their
fathers
even
as
it
was
in
the
beginning
and
they
were
taught
to
hate
the
children
of
god
even
as
the
lamanites
were
taught
to
hate
the
children
of
nephi
from
the
beginning

nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
two
hundred
and
forty
and
four
years
had
passed
away
and
thus
were
the
affairs
of
the
people
and
the
more
wicked
part
of
the
people
did
wax
strong
and
became
exceedingly
more
numerous
than
were
the
people
of
god

nephi

and
they
did
still
continue
to
build
up
churches
unto
themselves
and
adorn
them
with
all
manner
of
precious
things
and
thus
did
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
pass
away
and
also
two
hundred
and
sixty
years

nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
wicked
part
of
the
people
began
again
to
build
up
the
secret
oaths
and
combinations
of
gadianton

nephi

and
also
the
people
who
were
called
the
people
of
nephi
began
to
be
proud
in
their
hearts
because
of
their
exceeding
riches
and
become
vain
like
unto
their
brethren
the
lamanites

nephi

and
from
this
time
the
disciples
began
to
sorrow
for
the
sins
of
the
world

nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
three
hundred
years
had
passed
away
both
the
people
of
nephi
and
the
lamanites
had
become
exceedingly
wicked
one
like
unto
another

nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
robbers
of
gadianton
did
spread
over
all
the
face
of
the
land
and
there
were
none
that
were
righteous
save
it
were
the
disciples
of
jesus
and
gold
and
silver
did
they
lay
up
in
store
in
abundance
and
did
traffic
in
all
manner
of
traffic

nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
three
hundred
and
five
years
had
passed
away
and
the
people
did
still
remain
in
wickedness
amos
died
and
his
brother
ammaron
did
keep
the
record
in
his
stead

nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
three
hundred
and
twenty
years
had
passed
away
ammaron
being
constrained
by
the
holy
ghost
did
hide
up
the
records
which
were
sacredyea
even
all
the
sacred
records
which
had
been
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
which
were
sacredeven
until
the
three
hundred
and
twentieth
year
from
the
coming
of
christ

nephi

and
he
did
hide
them
up
unto
the
lord
that
they
might
come
again
unto
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
jacob
according
to
the
prophecies
and
the
promises
of
the
lord
and
thus
is
the
end
of
the
record
of
ammaron
the
book
of
mormon
mormon
chapter


and
now
i
mormon
make
a
record
of
the
things
which
i
have
both
seen
and
heard
and
call
it
the
book
of
mormon

and
about
the
time
that
ammaron
hid
up
the
records
unto
the
lord
he
came
unto
me
i
being
about
ten
years
of
age
and
i
began
to
be
learned
somewhat
after
the
manner
of
the
learning
of
my
people
and
ammaron
said
unto
me
i
perceive
that
thou
art
a
sober
child
and
art
quick
to
observe

therefore
when
ye
are
about
twenty
and
four
years
old
i
would
that
ye
should
remember
the
things
that
ye
have
observed
concerning
this
people
and
when
ye
are
of
that
age
go
to
the
land
antum
unto
a
hill
which
shall
be
called
shim
and
there
have
i
deposited
unto
the
lord
all
the
sacred
engravings
concerning
this
people

and
behold
ye
shall
take
the
plates
of
nephi
unto
yourself
and
the
remainder
shall
ye
leave
in
the
place
where
they
are
and
ye
shall
engrave
on
the
plates
of
nephi
all
the
things
that
ye
have
observed
concerning
this
people

and
i
mormon
being
a
descendant
of
nephi
and
my
fathers
name
was
mormon
i
remembered
the
things
which
ammaron
commanded
me

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
being
eleven
years
old
was
carried
by
my
father
into
the
land
southward
even
to
the
land
of
zarahemla

the
whole
face
of
the
land
had
become
covered
with
buildings
and
the
people
were
as
numerous
almost
as
it
were
the
sand
of
the
sea

and
it
came
to
pass
in
this
year
there
began
to
be
a
war
between
the
nephites
who
consisted
of
the
nephites
and
the
jacobites
and
the
josephites
and
the
zoramites
and
this
war
was
between
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites
and
the
lemuelites
and
the
ishmaelites

now
the
lamanites
and
the
lemuelites
and
the
ishmaelites
were
called
lamanites
and
the
two
parties
were
nephites
and
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
war
began
to
be
among
them
in
the
borders
of
zarahemla
by
the
waters
of
sidon

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
nephites
had
gathered
together
a
great
number
of
men
even
to
exceed
the
number
of
thirty
thousand
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
have
in
this
same
year
a
number
of
battles
in
which
the
nephites
did
beat
the
lamanites
and
did
slay
many
of
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
withdrew
their
design
and
there
was
peace
settled
in
the
land
and
peace
did
remain
for
the
space
of
about
four
years
that
there
was
no
bloodshed

but
wickedness
did
prevail
upon
the
face
of
the
whole
land
insomuch
that
the
lord
did
take
away
his
beloved
disciples
and
the
work
of
miracles
and
of
healing
did
cease
because
of
the
iniquity
of
the
people

and
there
were
no
gifts
from
the
lord
and
the
holy
ghost
did
not
come
upon
any
because
of
their
wickedness
and
unbelief

and
i
being
fifteen
years
of
age
and
being
somewhat
of
a
sober
mind
therefore
i
was
visited
of
the
lord
and
tasted
and
knew
of
the
goodness
of
jesus

and
i
did
endeavor
to
preach
unto
this
people
but
my
mouth
was
shut
and
i
was
forbidden
that
i
should
preach
unto
them
for
behold
they
had
wilfully
rebelled
against
their
god
and
the
beloved
disciples
were
taken
away
out
of
the
land
because
of
their
iniquity

but
i
did
remain
among
them
but
i
was
forbidden
to
preach
unto
them
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
the
land
was
cursed
for
their
sake

and
these
gadianton
robbers
who
were
among
the
lamanites
did
infest
the
land
insomuch
that
the
inhabitants
thereof
began
to
hide
up
their
treasures
in
the
earth
and
they
became
slippery
because
the
lord
had
cursed
the
land
that
they
could
not
hold
them
nor
retain
them
again

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
sorceries
and
witchcrafts
and
magics
and
the
power
of
the
evil
one
was
wrought
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
even
unto
the
fulfilling
of
all
the
words
of
abinadi
and
also
samuel
the
lamanite
mormon
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
in
that
same
year
there
began
to
be
a
war
again
between
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites
and
notwithstanding
i
being
young
was
large
in
stature
therefore
the
people
of
nephi
appointed
me
that
i
should
be
their
leader
or
the
leader
of
their
armies

therefore
it
came
to
pass
that
in
my
sixteenth
year
i
did
go
forth
at
the
head
of
an
army
of
the
nephites
against
the
lamanites
therefore
three
hundred
and
twenty
and
six
years
had
passed
away

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
three
hundred
and
twenty
and
seventh
year
the
lamanites
did
come
upon
us
with
exceedingly
great
power
insomuch
that
they
did
frighten
my
armies
therefore
they
would
not
fight
and
they
began
to
retreat
towards
the
north
countries

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
come
to
the
city
of
angola
and
we
did
take
possession
of
the
city
and
make
preparations
to
defend
ourselves
against
the
lamanites
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
fortify
the
city
with
our
might
but
notwithstanding
all
our
fortifications
the
lamanites
did
come
upon
us
and
did
drive
us
out
of
the
city

and
they
did
also
drive
us
forth
out
of
the
land
of
david

and
we
marched
forth
and
came
to
the
land
of
joshua
which
was
in
the
borders
west
by
the
seashore

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
gather
in
our
people
as
fast
as
it
were
possible
that
we
might
get
them
together
in
one
body

but
behold
the
land
was
filled
with
robbers
and
with
lamanites
and
notwithstanding
the
great
destruction
which
hung
over
my
people
they
did
not
repent
of
their
evil
doings
therefore
there
was
blood
and
carnage
spread
throughout
all
the
face
of
the
land
both
on
the
part
of
the
nephites
and
also
on
the
part
of
the
lamanites
and
it
was
one
complete
revolution
throughout
all
the
face
of
the
land

and
now
the
lamanites
had
a
king
and
his
name
was
aaron
and
he
came
against
us
with
an
army
of
forty
and
four
thousand
and
behold
i
withstood
him
with
forty
and
two
thousand
and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
beat
him
with
my
army
that
he
fled
before
me
and
behold
all
this
was
done
and
three
hundred
and
thirty
years
had
passed
away

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
nephites
began
to
repent
of
their
iniquity
and
began
to
cry
even
as
had
been
prophesied
by
samuel
the
prophet
for
behold
no
man
could
keep
that
which
was
his
own
for
the
thieves
and
the
robbers
and
the
murderers
and
the
magic
art
and
the
witchcraft
which
was
in
the
land

thus
there
began
to
be
a
mourning
and
a
lamentation
in
all
the
land
because
of
these
things
and
more
especially
among
the
people
of
nephi

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
i
mormon
saw
their
lamentation
and
their
mourning
and
their
sorrow
before
the
lord
my
heart
did
begin
to
rejoice
within
me
knowing
the
mercies
and
the
longsuffering
of
the
lord
therefore
supposing
that
he
would
be
merciful
unto
them
that
they
would
again
become
a
righteous
people

but
behold
this
my
joy
was
vain
for
their
sorrowing
was
not
unto
repentance
because
of
the
goodness
of
god
but
it
was
rather
the
sorrowing
of
the
damned
because
the
lord
would
not
always
suffer
them
to
take
happiness
in
sin

and
they
did
not
come
unto
jesus
with
broken
hearts
and
contrite
spirits
but
they
did
curse
god
and
wish
to
die
nevertheless
they
would
struggle
with
the
sword
for
their
lives

and
it
came
to
pass
that
my
sorrow
did
return
unto
me
again
and
i
saw
that
the
day
of
grace
was
passed
with
them
both
temporally
and
spiritually
for
i
saw
thousands
of
them
hewn
down
in
open
rebellion
against
their
god
and
heaped
up
as
dung
upon
the
face
of
the
land
and
thus
three
hundred
and
forty
and
four
years
had
passed
away

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
three
hundred
and
forty
and
fifth
year
the
nephites
did
begin
to
flee
before
the
lamanites
and
they
were
pursued
until
they
came
even
to
the
land
of
jashon
before
it
was
possible
to
stop
them
in
their
retreat

and
now
the
city
of
jashon
was
near
the
land
where
ammaron
had
deposited
the
records
unto
the
lord
that
they
might
not
be
destroyed
and
behold
i
had
gone
according
to
the
word
of
ammaron
and
taken
the
plates
of
nephi
and
did
make
a
record
according
to
the
words
of
ammaron

and
upon
the
plates
of
nephi
i
did
make
a
full
account
of
all
the
wickedness
and
abominations
but
upon
these
plates
i
did
forbear
to
make
a
full
account
of
their
wickedness
and
abominations
for
behold
a
continual
scene
of
wickedness
and
abominations
has
been
before
mine
eyes
ever
since
i
have
been
sufficient
to
behold
the
ways
of
man

and
wo
is
me
because
of
their
wickedness
for
my
heart
has
been
filled
with
sorrow
because
of
their
wickedness
all
my
days
nevertheless
i
know
that
i
shall
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
year
the
people
of
nephi
again
were
hunted
and
driven
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
were
driven
forth
until
we
had
come
northward
to
the
land
which
was
called
shem

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
fortify
the
city
of
shem
and
we
did
gather
in
our
people
as
much
as
it
were
possible
that
perhaps
we
might
save
them
from
destruction

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
three
hundred
and
forty
and
sixth
year
they
began
to
come
upon
us
again

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
did
speak
unto
my
people
and
did
urge
them
with
great
energy
that
they
would
stand
boldly
before
the
lamanites
and
fight
for
their
wives
and
their
children
and
their
houses
and
their
homes

and
my
words
did
arouse
them
somewhat
to
vigor
insomuch
that
they
did
not
flee
from
before
the
lamanites
but
did
stand
with
boldness
against
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
contend
with
an
army
of
thirty
thousand
against
an
army
of
fifty
thousand
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
stand
before
them
with
such
firmness
that
they
did
flee
from
before
us

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
fled
we
did
pursue
them
with
our
armies
and
did
meet
them
again
and
did
beat
them
nevertheless
the
strength
of
the
lord
was
not
with
us
yea
we
were
left
to
ourselves
that
the
spirit
of
the
lord
did
not
abide
in
us
therefore
we
had
become
weak
like
unto
our
brethren

and
my
heart
did
sorrow
because
of
this
the
great
calamity
of
my
people
because
of
their
wickedness
and
their
abominations
but
behold
we
did
go
forth
against
the
lamanites
and
the
robbers
of
gadianton
until
we
had
again
taken
possession
of
the
lands
of
our
inheritance

and
the
three
hundred
and
forty
and
ninth
year
had
passed
away
and
in
the
three
hundred
and
fiftieth
year
we
made
a
treaty
with
the
lamanites
and
the
robbers
of
gadianton
in
which
we
did
get
the
lands
of
our
inheritance
divided

and
the
lamanites
did
give
unto
us
the
land
northward
yea
even
to
the
narrow
passage
which
led
into
the
land
southward
and
we
did
give
unto
the
lamanites
all
the
land
southward
mormon
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
did
not
come
to
battle
again
until
ten
years
more
had
passed
away
and
behold
i
had
employed
my
people
the
nephites
in
preparing
their
lands
and
their
arms
against
the
time
of
battle

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
did
say
unto
me
cry
unto
this
peoplerepent
ye
and
come
unto
me
and
be
ye
baptized
and
build
up
again
my
church
and
ye
shall
be
spared

and
i
did
cry
unto
this
people
but
it
was
in
vain
and
they
did
not
realize
that
it
was
the
lord
that
had
spared
them
and
granted
unto
them
a
chance
for
repentance
and
behold
they
did
harden
their
hearts
against
the
lord
their
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
this
tenth
year
had
passed
away
making
in
the
whole
three
hundred
and
sixty
years
from
the
coming
of
christ
the
king
of
the
lamanites
sent
an
epistle
unto
me
which
gave
unto
me
to
know
that
they
were
preparing
to
come
again
to
battle
against
us

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
did
cause
my
people
that
they
should
gather
themselves
together
at
the
land
desolation
to
a
city
which
was
in
the
borders
by
the
narrow
pass
which
led
into
the
land
southward

and
there
we
did
place
our
armies
that
we
might
stop
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
that
they
might
not
get
possession
of
any
of
our
lands
therefore
we
did
fortify
against
them
with
all
our
force

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
and
first
year
the
lamanites
did
come
down
to
the
city
of
desolation
to
battle
against
us
and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
that
year
we
did
beat
them
insomuch
that
they
did
return
to
their
own
lands
again

and
in
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
and
second
year
they
did
come
down
again
to
battle
and
we
did
beat
them
again
and
did
slay
a
great
number
of
them
and
their
dead
were
cast
into
the
sea

and
now
because
of
this
great
thing
which
my
people
the
nephites
had
done
they
began
to
boast
in
their
own
strength
and
began
to
swear
before
the
heavens
that
they
would
avenge
themselves
of
the
blood
of
their
brethren
who
had
been
slain
by
their
enemies

and
they
did
swear
by
the
heavens
and
also
by
the
throne
of
god
that
they
would
go
up
to
battle
against
their
enemies
and
would
cut
them
off
from
the
face
of
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
mormon
did
utterly
refuse
from
this
time
forth
to
be
a
commander
and
a
leader
of
this
people
because
of
their
wickedness
and
abomination

behold
i
had
led
them
notwithstanding
their
wickedness
i
had
led
them
many
times
to
battle
and
had
loved
them
according
to
the
love
of
god
which
was
in
me
with
all
my
heart
and
my
soul
had
been
poured
out
in
prayer
unto
my
god
all
the
day
long
for
them
nevertheless
it
was
without
faith
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts

and
thrice
have
i
delivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
and
they
have
repented
not
of
their
sins

and
when
they
had
sworn
by
all
that
had
been
forbidden
them
by
our
lord
and
savior
jesus
christ
that
they
would
go
up
unto
their
enemies
to
battle
and
avenge
themselves
of
the
blood
of
their
brethren
behold
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying

vengeance
is
mine
and
i
will
repay
and
because
this
people
repented
not
after
i
had
delivered
them
behold
they
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
face
of
the
earth

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
utterly
refused
to
go
up
against
mine
enemies
and
i
did
even
as
the
lord
had
commanded
me
and
i
did
stand
as
an
idle
witness
to
manifest
unto
the
world
the
things
which
i
saw
and
heard
according
to
the
manifestations
of
the
spirit
which
had
testified
of
things
to
come

therefore
i
write
unto
you
gentiles
and
also
unto
you
house
of
israel
when
the
work
shall
commence
that
ye
shall
be
about
to
prepare
to
return
to
the
land
of
your
inheritance

yea
behold
i
write
unto
all
the
ends
of
the
earth

unto
you

tribes
of
israel
who
shall
be
judged
according
to
your
works
by
the
twelve
whom
jesus
chose
to
be
his
disciples
in
the
land
of
jerusalem

and
i
write
also
unto
the
remnant
of
this
people
who
shall
also
be
judged
by
the
twelve
whom
jesus
chose
in
this
land
and
they
shall
be
judged
by
the
other
twelve

and
these
things
doth

spirit
manifest
unto
me
therefore
i
write
unto
you
all
and
for
this
cause
i
write
unto
you
that
ye
may
know
that
ye
must
all
stand
before
the
judgmentseat
of

yea
every
soul
who
belongs
to
the
whole
human
family
of
adam
and
ye
must
stand
to
be
judged
of
your
works
whether
they
be
good
or
evil

and
also
that
ye
may
believe
the
gospel
of
jesus

which
ye
shall
have
among
you
and
also
that
the
jews
the
covenant
people
of
the
lord
shall
have
other
witness
besides
him
whom
they
saw
and
heard
that
jesus
whom
they
slew
was
the
very
christ
and
the
very
god

and
i
would
that
i
could
persuade
all
ye
ends
of
the
earth
to
repent
and
prepare
to
stand
before
the
judgmentseat
of
christ

chapter


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
and
third
year
the
nephites
did
go
up
with
their
armies
to
battle
against
the
lamanites
out
of
the
land
desolation

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
of
the
nephites
were
driven
back
again
to
the
land
of
desolation
and
while
they
were
yet
weary
a
fresh
army
of
the
lamanites
did
come
upon
them
and
they
had
a
sore
battle
insomuch
that
the
lamanites
did
take
possession
of
the
city
desolation
and
did
slay
many
of
the
nephites
and
did
take
many
prisoners

and
the
remainder
did
flee
and
join
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
teancum
now
the
city
teancum
lay
in
the
borders
by
the
seashore
and
it
was
also
near
the
city
desolation

and
it
was
because
the
armies
of
the
nephites
went
up
unto
the
lamanites
that
they
began
to
be
smitten
for
were
it
not
for
that
the
lamanites
could
have
had
no
power
over
them

but
behold
the
judgments
of
god
will
overtake
the
wicked
and
it
is
by
the
wicked
that
the
wicked
are
punished
for
it
is
the
wicked
that
stir
up
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
unto
bloodshed

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
did
make
preparations
to
come
against
the
city
teancum

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
and
fourth
year
the
lamanites
did
come
against
the
city
teancum
that
they
might
take
possession
of
the
city
teancum
also

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
repulsed
and
driven
back
by
the
nephites
and
when
the
nephites
saw
that
they
had
driven
the
lamanites
they
did
again
boast
of
their
own
strength
and
they
went
forth
in
their
own
might
and
took
possession
again
of
the
city
desolation

and
now
all
these
things
had
been
done
and
there
had
been
thousands
slain
on
both
sides
both
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
and
sixth
year
had
passed
away
and
the
lamanites
came
again
upon
the
nephites
to
battle
and
yet
the
nephites
repented
not
of
the
evil
they
had
done
but
persisted
in
their
wickedness
continually

and
it
is
impossible
for
the
tongue
to
describe
or
for
man
to
write
a
perfect
description
of
the
horrible
scene
of
the
blood
and
carnage
which
was
among
the
people
both
of
the
nephites
and
of
the
lamanites
and
every
heart
was
hardened
so
that
they
delighted
in
the
shedding
of
blood
continually

and
there
never
had
been
so
great
wickedness
among
all
the
children
of
lehi
nor
even
among
all
the
house
of
israel
according
to
the
words
of
the
lord
as
was
among
this
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
did
take
possession
of
the
city
desolation
and
this
because
their
number
did
exceed
the
number
of
the
nephites

and
they
did
also
march
forward
against
the
city
teancum
and
did
drive
the
inhabitants
forth
out
of
her
and
did
take
many
prisoners
both
women
and
children
and
did
offer
them
up
as
sacrifices
unto
their
idol
gods

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
and
seventh
year
the
nephites
being
angry
because
the
lamanites
had
sacrificed
their
women
and
their
children
that
they
did
go
against
the
lamanites
with
exceedingly
great
anger
insomuch
that
they
did
beat
again
the
lamanites
and
drive
them
out
of
their
lands

and
the
lamanites
did
not
come
again
against
the
nephites
until
the
three
hundred
and
seventy
and
fifth
year

and
in
this
year
they
did
come
down
against
the
nephites
with
all
their
powers
and
they
were
not
numbered
because
of
the
greatness
of
their
number

and
from
this
time
forth
did
the
nephites
gain
no
power
over
the
lamanites
but
began
to
be
swept
off
by
them
even
as
a
dew
before
the
sun

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
did
come
down
against
the
city
desolation
and
there
was
an
exceedingly
sore
battle
fought
in
the
land
desolation
in
the
which
they
did
beat
the
nephites

and
they
fled
again
from
before
them
and
they
came
to
the
city
boaz
and
there
they
did
stand
against
the
lamanites
with
exceeding
boldness
insomuch
that
the
lamanites
did
not
beat
them
until
they
had
come
again
the
second
time

and
when
they
had
come
the
second
time
the
nephites
were
driven
and
slaughtered
with
an
exceedingly
great
slaughter
their
women
and
their
children
were
again
sacrificed
unto
idols

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
nephites
did
again
flee
from
before
them
taking
all
the
inhabitants
with
them
both
in
towns
and
villages

and
now
i
mormon
seeing
that
the
lamanites
were
about
to
overthrow
the
land
therefore
i
did
go
to
the
hill
shim
and
did
take
up
all
the
records
which
ammaron
had
hid
up
unto
the
lord
mormon
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
did
go
forth
among
the
nephites
and
did
repent
of
the
oath
which
i
had
made
that
i
would
no
more
assist
them
and
they
gave
me
command
again
of
their
armies
for
they
looked
upon
me
as
though
i
could
deliver
them
from
their
afflictions

but
behold
i
was
without
hope
for
i
knew
the
judgments
of
the
lord
which
should
come
upon
them
for
they
repented
not
of
their
iniquities
but
did
struggle
for
their
lives
without
calling
upon
that
being
who
created
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
did
come
against
us
as
we
had
fled
to
the
city
of
jordan
but
behold
they
were
driven
back
that
they
did
not
take
the
city
at
that
time

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
came
against
us
again
and
we
did
maintain
the
city
and
there
were
also
other
cities
which
were
maintained
by
nephites
which
strongholds
did
cut
them
off
that
they
could
not
get
into
the
country
which
lay
before
us
to
destroy
the
inhabitants
of
our
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
whatsoever
lands
we
had
passed
by
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
were
not
gathered
in
were
destroyed
by
the
lamanites
and
their
towns
and
villages
and
cities
were
burned
with
fire
and
thus
three
hundred
and
seventy
and
nine
years
passed
away

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
three
hundred
and
eightieth
year
the
lamanites
did
come
again
against
us
to
battle
and
we
did
stand
against
them
boldly
but
it
was
all
in
vain
for
so
great
were
their
numbers
that
they
did
tread
the
people
of
the
nephites
under
their
feet

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
again
take
to
flight
and
those
whose
flight
was
swifter
than
the
lamanites
did
escape
and
those
whose
flight
did
not
exceed
the
lamanites
were
swept
down
and
destroyed

and
now
behold
i
mormon
do
not
desire
to
harrow
up
the
souls
of
men
in
casting
before
them
such
an
awful
scene
of
blood
and
carnage
as
was
laid
before
mine
eyes
but
i
knowing
that
these
things
must
surely
be
made
known
and
that
all
things
which
are
hid
must
be
revealed
upon
the
housetops

and
also
that
a
knowledge
of
these
things
must
come
unto
the
remnant
of
these
people
and
also
unto
the
gentiles
who
the
lord
hath
said
should
scatter
this
people
and
this
people
should
be
counted
as
naught
among
themtherefore
i
write
a
small
abridgment
daring
not
to
give
a
full
account
of
the
things
which
i
have
seen
because
of
the
commandment
which
i
have
received
and
also
that
ye
might
not
have
too
great
sorrow
because
of
the
wickedness
of
this
people

and
now
behold
this
i
speak
unto
their
seed
and
also
to
the
gentiles
who
have
care
for
the
house
of
israel
that
realize
and
know
from
whence
their
blessings
come

for
i
know
that
such
will
sorrow
for
the
calamity
of
the
house
of
israel
yea
they
will
sorrow
for
the
destruction
of
this
people
they
will
sorrow
that
this
people
had
not
repented
that
they
might
have
been
clasped
in
the
arms
of
jesus

now
these
things
are
written
unto
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
jacob
and
they
are
written
after
this
manner
because
it
is
known
of
god
that
wickedness
will
not
bring
them
forth
unto
them
and
they
are
to
be
hid
up
unto
the
lord
that
they
may
come
forth
in
his
own
due
time

and
this
is
the
commandment
which
i
have
received
and
behold
they
shall
come
forth
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
lord
when
he
shall
see
fit
in
his
wisdom

and
behold
they
shall
go
unto
the
unbelieving
of
the
jews
and
for
this
intent
shall
they
gothat
they
may
be
persuaded
that
jesus
is
the
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
that
the
father
may
bring
about
through
his
most
beloved
his
great
and
eternal
purpose
in
restoring
the
jews
or
all
the
house
of
israel
to
the
land
of
their
inheritance
which
the
lord
their
god
hath
given
them
unto
the
fulfilling
of
his
covenant

and
also
that
the
seed
of
this
people
may
more
fully
believe
his
gospel
which
shall
go
forth
unto
them
from
the
gentiles
for
this
people
shall
be
scattered
and
shall
become
a
dark
a
filthy
and
a
loathsome
people
beyond
the
description
of
that
which
ever
hath
been
amongst
us
yea
even
that
which
hath
been
among
the
lamanites
and
this
because
of
their
unbelief
and
idolatry

for
behold
the
spirit
of
the
lord
hath
already
ceased
to
strive
with
their
fathers
and
they
are
without
christ
and
god
in
the
world
and
they
are
driven
about
as
chaff
before
the
wind

they
were
once
a
delightsome
people
and
they
had
christ
for
their
shepherd
yea
they
were
led
even
by
god
the
father

but
now
behold
they
are
led
about
by
satan
even
as
chaff
is
driven
before
the
wind
or
as
a
vessel
is
tossed
about
upon
the
waves
without
sail
or
anchor
or
without
anything
wherewith
to
steer
her
and
even
as
she
is
so
are
they

and
behold
the
lord
hath
reserved
their
blessings
which
they
might
have
received
in
the
land
for
the
gentiles
who
shall
possess
the
land

but
behold
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
they
shall
be
driven
and
scattered
by
the
gentiles
and
after
they
have
been
driven
and
scattered
by
the
gentiles
behold
then
will
the
lord
remember
the
covenant
which
he
made
unto
abraham
and
unto
all
the
house
of
israel

and
also
the
lord
will
remember
the
prayers
of
the
righteous
which
have
been
put
up
unto
him
for
them

and
then
o
ye
gentiles
how
can
ye
stand
before
the
power
of
god
except
ye
shall
repent
and
turn
from
your
evil
ways

know
ye
not
that
ye
are
in
the
hands
of
god
know
ye
not
that
he
hath
all
power
and
at
his
great
command
the
earth
shall
be
rolled
together
as
a
scroll

therefore
repent
ye
and
humble
yourselves
before
him
lest
he
shall
come
out
in
justice
against
youlest
a
remnant
of
the
seed
of
jacob
shall
go
forth
among
you
as
a
lion
and
tear
you
in
pieces
and
there
is
none
to
deliver
mormon
chapter


and
now
i
finish
my
record
concerning
the
destruction
of
my
people
the
nephites
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
march
forth
before
the
lamanites

and
i
mormon
wrote
an
epistle
unto
the
king
of
the
lamanites
and
desired
of
him
that
he
would
grant
unto
us
that
we
might
gather
together
our
people
unto
the
land
of
cumorah
by
a
hill
which
was
called
cumorah
and
there
we
could
give
them
battle

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
of
the
lamanites
did
grant
unto
me
the
thing
which
i
desired

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
march
forth
to
the
land
of
cumorah
and
we
did
pitch
our
tents
around
about
the
hill
cumorah
and
it
was
in
a
land
of
many
waters
rivers
and
fountains
and
here
we
had
hope
to
gain
advantage
over
the
lamanites

and
when
three
hundred
and
eighty
and
four
years
had
passed
away
we
had
gathered
in
all
the
remainder
of
our
people
unto
the
land
of
cumorah

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
we
had
gathered
in
all
our
people
in
one
to
the
land
of
cumorah
behold
i
mormon
began
to
be
old
and
knowing
it
to
be
the
last
struggle
of
my
people
and
having
been
commanded
of
the
lord
that
i
should
not
suffer
the
records
which
had
been
handed
down
by
our
fathers
which
were
sacred
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
lamanites
for
the
lamanites
would
destroy
them
therefore
i
made
this
record
out
of
the
plates
of
nephi
and
hid
up
in
the
hill
cumorah
all
the
records
which
had
been
entrusted
to
me
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
save
it
were
these
few
plates
which
i
gave
unto
my
son
moroni

and
it
came
to
pass
that
my
people
with
their
wives
and
their
children
did
now
behold
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
marching
towards
them
and
with
that
awful
fear
of
death
which
fills
the
breasts
of
all
the
wicked
did
they
await
to
receive
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
came
to
battle
against
us
and
every
soul
was
filled
with
terror
because
of
the
greatness
of
their
numbers

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
fall
upon
my
people
with
the
sword
and
with
the
bow
and
with
the
arrow
and
with
the
ax
and
with
all
manner
of
weapons
of
war

and
it
came
to
pass
that
my
men
were
hewn
down
yea
even
my
ten
thousand
who
were
with
me
and
i
fell
wounded
in
the
midst
and
they
passed
by
me
that
they
did
not
put
an
end
to
my
life

and
when
they
had
gone
through
and
hewn
down
all
my
people
save
it
were
twenty
and
four
of
us
among
whom
was
my
son
moroni
and
we
having
survived
the
dead
of
our
people
did
behold
on
the
morrow
when
the
lamanites
had
returned
unto
their
camps
from
the
top
of
the
hill
cumorah
the
ten
thousand
of
my
people
who
were
hewn
down
being
led
in
the
front
by
me

and
we
also
beheld
the
ten
thousand
of
my
people
who
were
led
by
my
son
moroni

and
behold
the
ten
thousand
of
gidgiddonah
had
fallen
and
he
also
in
the
midst

and
lamah
had
fallen
with
his
ten
thousand
and
gilgal
had
fallen
with
his
ten
thousand
and
limhah
had
fallen
with
his
ten
thousand
and
jeneum
had
fallen
with
his
ten
thousand

cumenihah
and
moronihah
and
antionum
and
shiblom
and

had
fallen
with
their
ten
thousand
each

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
ten
more
who
did
fall
by
the
sword
with
their
ten
thousand
each
yea
even
all
my
people
save
it
were
those
twenty
and
four
who
were
with
me
and
also
a
few
who
had
escaped
into
the
south
countries
and
a
few
who
had
deserted
over
unto
the
lamanites
had
fallen
and
their
flesh
and
bones
and
blood
lay
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
being
left
by
the
hands
of
those
who
slew
them
to
molder
upon
the
land
and
to
crumble
and
to
return
to
their
mother
earth

and
my
soul
was
rent
with
anguish
because
of
the
slain
of
my
people
and
i
cried

o
ye
fair
ones
how
could
ye
have
departed
from
the
ways
of
the
lord
o
ye
fair
ones
how
could
ye
have
rejected
that
jesus
who
stood
with
open
arms
to
receive
you

behold
if
ye
had
not
done
this
ye
would
not
have
fallen
but
behold
ye
are
fallen
and
i
mourn
your
loss

o
ye
fair
sons
and
daughters
ye
fathers
and
mothers
ye
husbands
and
wives
ye
fair
ones
how
is
it
that
ye
could
have
fallen

but
behold
ye
are
gone
and
my
sorrows
cannot
bring
your
return

and
the
day
soon
cometh
that
your
mortal
must
put
on
immortality
and
these
bodies
which
are
now
moldering
in
corruption
must
soon
become
incorruptible
bodies
and
then
ye
must
stand
before
the
judgmentseat
of
christ
to
be
judged
according
to
your
works
and
if
it
so
be
that
ye
are
righteous
then
are
ye
blessed
with
your
fathers
who
have
gone
before
you

o
that
ye
had
repented
before
this
great
destruction
had
come
upon
you
but
behold
ye
are
gone
and
the
father
yea
the
eternal
father
of
heaven
knoweth
your
state
and
he
doeth
with
you
according
to
his
justice
and
mercy
mormon
chapter


and
now
behold
i
would
speak
somewhat
unto
the
remnant
of
this
people
who
are
spared
if
it
so
be
that
god
may
give
unto
them
my
words
that
they
may
know
of
the
things
of
their
fathers
yea
i
speak
unto
you
ye
remnant
of
the
house
of
israel
and
these
are
the
words
which
i
speak

know
ye
that
ye
are
of
the
house
of
israel

know
ye
that
ye
must
come
unto
repentance
or
ye
cannot
be
saved

know
ye
that
ye
must
lay
down
your
weapons
of
war
and
delight
no
more
in
the
shedding
of
blood
and
take
them
not
again
save
it
be
that
god
shall
command
you

know
ye
that
ye
must
come
to
the
knowledge
of
your
fathers
and
repent
of
all
your
sins
and
iniquities
and
believe
in
jesus
christ
that
he
is
the
son
of
god
and
that
he
was
slain
by
the
jews
and
by
the
power
of
the
father
he
hath
risen
again
whereby
he
hath
gained
the
victory
over
the
grave
and
also
in
him
is
the
sting
of
death
swallowed
up

and
he
bringeth
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
whereby
man
must
be
raised
to
stand
before
his
judgmentseat

and
he
hath
brought
to
pass
the
redemption
of
the
world
whereby
he
that
is
found
guiltless
before
him
at
the
judgment
day
hath
it
given
unto
him
to
dwell
in
the
presence
of
god
in
his
kingdom
to
sing
ceaseless
praises
with
the
choirs
above
unto
the
father
and
unto
the
son
and
unto
the
holy
ghost
which
are
one
god
in
a
state
of
happiness
which
hath
no
end

therefore
repent
and
be
baptized
in
the
name
of
jesus
and
lay
hold
upon
the
gospel
of
christ
which
shall
be
set
before
you
not
only
in
this
record
but
also
in
the
record
which
shall
come
unto
the
gentiles
from
the
jews
which
record
shall
come
from
the
gentiles
unto
you

for
behold
this
is
written
for
the
intent
that
ye
may
believe
that
and
if
ye
believe
that
ye
will
believe
this
also
and
if
ye
believe
this
ye
will
know
concerning
your
fathers
and
also
the
marvelous
works
which
were
wrought
by
the
power
of
god
among
them

and
ye
will
also
know
that
ye
are
a
remnant
of
the
seed
of
jacob
therefore
ye
are
numbered
among
the
people
of
the
first
covenant
and
if
it
so
be
that
ye
believe
in
christ
and
are
baptized
first
with
water
then
with
fire
and
with
the
holy
ghost
following
the
example
of
our
savior
according
to
that
which
he
hath
commanded
us
it
shall
be
well
with
you
in

mormon
chapter


behold
i
moroni
do
finish
the
record
of
my
father
mormon
behold
i
have
but
few
things
to
write
which
things
i
have
been
commanded
by
my
father

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
great
and
tremendous
battle
at
cumorah
behold
the
nephites
who
had
escaped
into
the
country
southward
were
hunted
by
the
lamanites
until
they
were
all
destroyed

and
my
father
also
was
killed
by
them
and
i
even
remain
alone
to
write
the
sad
tale
of
the
destruction
of
my
people
but
behold
they
are
gone
and
i
fulfil
the
commandment
of
my
father
and
whether
they
will
slay
me
i
know
not

therefore
i
will
write
and
hide
up
the
records
in
the
earth
and
whither
i
go
it
mattereth
not

behold
my
father
hath
made
this
record
and
he
hath
written
the
intent
thereof
and
behold
i
would
write
it
also
if
i
had
room
upon
the
plates
but
i
have
not
and
ore
i
have
none
for
i
am
alone
my
father
hath
been
slain
in
battle
and
all
my
kinsfolk
and
i
have
not
friends
nor
whither
to
go
and
how
long
the
lord
will
suffer
that
i
may
live
i
know
not

behold
four
hundred
years
have
passed
away
since
the
coming
of
our
lord
and
savior

and
behold
the
lamanites
have
hunted
my
people
the
nephites
down
from
city
to
city
and
from
place
to
place
even
until
they
are
no
more
and
great
has
been
their
fall
yea
great
and
marvelous
is
the
destruction
of
my
people
the
nephites

and
behold
it
is
the
hand
of
the
lord
which
hath
done
it
and
behold
also
the
lamanites
are
at
war
one
with
another
and
the
whole
face
of
this
land
is
one
continual
round
of
murder
and
bloodshed
and
no
one
knoweth
the
end
of
the
war

and
now
behold
i
say
no
more
concerning
them
for
there
are
none
save
it
be
the
lamanites
and
robbers
that
do
exist
upon
the
face
of
the
land

and
there
are
none
that
do
know
the
true
god
save
it
be
the
disciples
of
jesus
who
did
tarry
in
the
land
until
the
wickedness
of
the
people
was
so
great
that
the
lord
would
not
suffer
them
to
remain
with
the
people
and
whether
they
be
upon
the
face
of
the
land
no
man
knoweth

but
behold
my
father
and
i
have
seen
them
and
they
have
ministered
unto
us

and
whoso
receiveth
this
record
and
shall
not
condemn
it
because
of
the
imperfections
which
are
in
it
the
same
shall
know
of
greater
things
than
these
behold
i
am
moroni
and
were
it
possible
i
would
make
all
things
known
unto
you

behold
i
make
an
end
of
speaking
concerning
this
people
i
am
the
son
of
mormon
and
my
father
was
a
descendant
of
nephi

and
i
am
the
same
who
hideth
up
this
record
unto
the
lord
the
plates
thereof
are
of
no
worth
because
of
the
commandment
of
the
lord
for
he
truly
saith
that
no
one
shall
have
them
to
get
gain
but
the
record
thereof
is
of
great
worth
and
whoso
shall
bring
it
to
light
him
will
the
lord
bless

for
none
can
have
power
to
bring
it
to
light
save
it
be
given
him
of
god
for
god
wills
that
it
shall
be
done
with
an
eye
single
to
his
glory
or
the
welfare
of
the
ancient
and
long
dispersed
covenant
people
of
the
lord

and
blessed
be
he
that
shall
bring
this
thing
to
light
for
it
shall
be
brought
out
of
darkness
unto
light
according
to
the
word
of
god
yea
it
shall
be
brought
out
of
the
earth
and
it
shall
shine
forth
out
of
darkness
and
come
unto
the
knowledge
of
the
people
and
it
shall
be
done
by
the
power
of
god

and
if
there
be
faults
they
be
the
faults
of
a
man
but
behold
we
know
no
fault
nevertheless
god
knoweth
all
things
therefore
he
that
condemneth
let
him
be
aware
lest
he
shall
be
in
danger
of
hell
fire

and
he
that
saith
show
unto
me
or
ye
shall
be
smittenlet
him
beware
lest
he
commandeth
that
which
is
forbidden
of
the
lord

for
behold
the
same
that
judgeth
rashly
shall
be
judged
rashly
again
for
according
to
his
works
shall
his
wages
be
therefore
he
that
smiteth
shall
be
smitten
again
of
the
lord

behold
what
the
scripture
saysman
shall
not
smite
neither
shall
he
judge
for
judgment
is
mine
saith
the
lord
and
vengeance
is
mine
also
and
i
will
repay

and
he
that
shall
breathe
out
wrath
and
strifes
against
the
work
of
the
lord
and
against
the
covenant
people
of
the
lord
who
are
the
house
of
israel
and
shall
say
we
will
destroy
the
work
of
the
lord
and
the
lord
will
not
remember
his
covenant
which
he
hath
made
unto
the
house
of
israelthe
same
is
in
danger
to
be
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire

for
the
eternal
purposes
of
the
lord
shall
roll
on
until
all
his
promises
shall
be
fulfilled

search
the
prophecies
of
isaiah
behold
i
cannot
write
them
yea
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
those
saints
who
have
gone
before
me
who
have
possessed
this
land
shall
cry
yea
even
from
the
dust
will
they
cry
unto
the
lord
and
as
the
lord
liveth
he
will
remember
the
covenant
which
he
hath
made
with
them

and
he
knoweth
their
prayers
that
they
were
in
behalf
of
their
brethren
and
he
knoweth
their
faith
for
in
his
name
could
they
remove
mountains
and
in
his
name
could
they
cause
the
earth
to
shake
and
by
the
power
of
his
word
did
they
cause
prisons
to
tumble
to
the
earth
yea
even
the
fiery
furnace
could
not
harm
them
neither
wild
beasts
nor
poisonous
serpents
because
of
the
power
of
his
word

and
behold
their
prayers
were
also
in
behalf
of
him
that
the
lord
should
suffer
to
bring
these
things
forth

and
no
one
need
say
they
shall
not
come
for
they
surely
shall
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
for
out
of
the
earth
shall
they
come
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
and
none
can
stay
it
and
it
shall
come
in
a
day
when
it
shall
be
said
that
miracles
are
done
away
and
it
shall
come
even
as
if
one
should
speak
from
the
dead

and
it
shall
come
in
a
day
when
the
blood
of
saints
shall
cry
unto
the
lord
because
of
secret
combinations
and
the
works
of
darkness

yea
it
shall
come
in
a
day
when
the
power
of
god
shall
be
denied
and
churches
become
defiled
and
be
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
hearts
yea
even
in
a
day
when
leaders
of
churches
and
teachers
shall
rise
in
the
pride
of
their
hearts
even
to
the
envying
of
them
who
belong
to
their
churches

yea
it
shall
come
in
a
day
when
there
shall
be
heard
of
fires
and
tempests
and
vapors
of
smoke
in
foreign
lands

and
there
shall
also
be
heard
of
wars
rumors
of
wars
and
earthquakes
in
divers
places

yea
it
shall
come
in
a
day
when
there
shall
be
great
pollutions
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
there
shall
be
murders
and
robbing
and
lying
and
deceivings
and
whoredoms
and
all
manner
of
abominations
when
there
shall
be
many
who
will
say
do
this
or
do
that
and
it
mattereth
not
for
the
lord
will
uphold
such
at
the
last
day
but
wo
unto
such
for
they
are
in
the
gall
of
bitterness
and
in
the
bonds
of
iniquity

yea
it
shall
come
in
a
day
when
there
shall
be
churches
built
up
that
shall
say
come
unto
me
and
for
your
money
you
shall
be
forgiven
of
your
sins

o
ye
wicked
and
perverse
and
stiffnecked
people
why
have
ye
built
up
churches
unto
yourselves
to
get
gain
why
have
ye
transfigured
the
holy
word
of
god
that
ye
might
bring
damnation
upon
your
souls
behold
look
ye
unto
the
revelations
of
god
for
behold
the
time
cometh
at
that
day
when
all
these
things
must
be
fulfilled

behold
the
lord
hath
shown
unto
me
great
and
marvelous
things
concerning
that
which
must
shortly
come
at
that
day
when
these
things
shall
come
forth
among
you

behold
i
speak
unto
you
as
if
ye
were
present
and
yet
ye
are
not
but
behold
jesus
christ
hath
shown
you
unto
me
and
i
know
your
doing

and
i
know
that
ye
do
walk
in
the
pride
of
your
hearts
and
there
are
none
save
a
few
only
who
do
not
lift
themselves
up
in
the
pride
of
their
hearts
unto
the
wearing
of
very
fine
apparel
unto
envying
and
strifes
and
malice
and
persecutions
and
all
manner
of
iniquities
and
your
churches
yea
even
every
one
have
become
polluted
because
of
the
pride
of
your
hearts

for
behold
ye
do
love
money
and
your
substance
and
your
fine
apparel
and
the
adorning
of
your
churches
more
than
ye
love
the
poor
and
the
needy
the
sick
and
the
afflicted

o
ye
pollutions
ye
hypocrites
ye
teachers
who
sell
yourselves
for
that
which
will
canker
why
have
ye
polluted
the
holy
church
of
god
why
are
ye
ashamed
to
take
upon
you
the
name
of
christ
why
do
ye
not
think
that
greater
is
the
value
of
an
endless
happiness
than
that
misery
which
never
diesbecause
of
the
praise
of
the
world

why
do
ye
adorn
yourselves
with
that
which
hath
no
life
and
yet
suffer
the
hungry
and
the
needy
and
the
naked
and
the
sick
and
the
afflicted
to
pass
by
you
and
notice
them
not

yea
why
do
ye
build
up
your
secret
abominations
to
get
gain
and
cause
that
widows
should
mourn
before
the
lord
and
also
orphans
to
mourn
before
the
lord
and
also
the
blood
of
their
fathers
and
their
husbands
to
cry
unto
the
lord
from
the
ground
for
vengeance
upon
your
heads

behold
the
sword
of
vengeance
hangeth
over
you
and
the
time
soon
cometh
that
he
avengeth
the
blood
of
the
saints
upon
you
for
he
will
not
suffer
their
cries
any
longer
mormon
chapter


and
now
i
speak
also
concerning
those
who
do
not
believe
in
christ

behold
will
ye
believe
in
the
day
of
your
visitationbehold
when
the
lord
shall
come
yea
even
that
great
day
when
the
earth
shall
be
rolled
together
as
a
scroll
and
the
elements
shall
melt
with
fervent
heat
yea
in
that
great
day
when
ye
shall
be
brought
to
stand
before
the
lamb
of

will
ye
say
that
there
is
no
god

then
will
ye
longer
deny
the
christ
or
can
ye
behold
the
lamb
of
god
do
ye
suppose
that
ye
shall
dwell
with
him
under
a
consciousness
of
your
guilt
do
ye
suppose
that
ye
could
be
happy
to
dwell
with
that
holy
being
when
your
souls
are
racked
with
a
consciousness
of
guilt
that
ye
have
ever
abused
his
laws

behold
i
say
unto
you
that
ye
would
be
more
miserable
to
dwell
with
a
holy
and
just
god
under
a
consciousness
of
your
filthiness
before
him
than
ye
would
to
dwell
with
the
damned
souls
in
hell

for
behold
when
ye
shall
be
brought
to
see
your
nakedness
before
god
and
also
the
glory
of
god
and
the
holiness
of
jesus
christ
it
will
kindle
a
flame
of
unquenchable
fire
upon
you

o
then
ye
unbelieving
turn
ye
unto
the
lord
cry
mightily
unto
the
father
in
the
name
of
jesus
that
perhaps
ye
may
be
found
spotless
pure
fair
and
white
having
been
cleansed
by
the
blood
of
the
lamb
at
that
great
and
last
day

and
again
i
speak
unto
you
who
deny
the
revelations
of
god
and
say
that
they
are
done
away
that
there
are
no
revelations
nor
prophecies
nor
gifts
nor
healing
nor
speaking
with
tongues
and
the
interpretation
of
tongues

behold
i
say
unto
you
he
that
denieth
these
things
knoweth
not
the
gospel
of
christ
yea
he
has
not
read
the
scriptures
if
so
he
does
not
understand
them

for
do
we
not
read
that
god
is
the
same
yesterday
today
and
forever
and
in
him
there
is
no
variableness
neither
shadow
of
changing

and
now
if
ye
have
imagined
up
unto
yourselves
a
god
who
doth
vary
and
in
whom
there
is
shadow
of
changing
then
have
ye
imagined
up
unto
yourselves
a
god
who
is
not
god
of
miracles

but
behold
i
will
show
unto
you
a
god
of
miracles
even
the
god
of
abraham
and
the
god
of
isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
and
it
is
that
same
god
who
created
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
all
things
that
in
them
are

behold
he
created
adam
and
by
adam
came
the
fall
of
man
and
because
of
the
fall
of
man
came
jesus
christ
even
the
father
and
the
son
and
because
of
jesus
christ
came
the
redemption
of
man

and
because
of
the
redemption
of
man
which
came
by
jesus
christ
they
are
brought
back
into
the
presence
of
the
lord
yea
this
is
wherein
all
men
are
redeemed
because
the
death
of
christ
bringeth
to
pass
the
resurrection
which
bringeth
to
pass
a
redemption
from
an
endless
sleep
from
which
sleep
all
men
shall
be
awakened
by
the
power
of
god
when
the
trump
shall
sound
and
they
shall
come
forth
both
small
and
great
and
all
shall
stand
before
his
bar
being
redeemed
and
loosed
from
this
eternal
band
of
death
which
death
is
a
temporal
death

and
then
cometh
the
judgment
of
the
holy
one
upon
them
and
then
cometh
the
time
that
he
that
is
filthy
shall
be
filthy
still
and
he
that
is
righteous
shall
be
righteous
still
he
that
is
happy
shall
be
happy
still
and
he
that
is
unhappy
shall
be
unhappy
still

and
now
o
all
ye
that
have
imagined
up
unto
yourselves
a
god
who
can
do
no
miracles
i
would
ask
of
you
have
all
these
things
passed
of
which
i
have
spoken
has
the
end
come
yet
behold
i
say
unto
you
nay
and
god
has
not
ceased
to
be
a
god
of
miracles

behold
are
not
the
things
that
god
hath
wrought
marvelous
in
our
eyes
yea
and
who
can
comprehend
the
marvelous
works
of
god

who
shall
say
that
it
was
not
a
miracle
that
by
his
word
the
heaven
and
the
earth
should
be
and
by
the
power
of
his
word
man
was
created
of
the
dust
of
the
earth
and
by
the
power
of
his
word
have
miracles
been
wrought

and
who
shall
say
that
jesus
christ
did
not
many
mighty
miracles
and
there
were
many
mighty
miracles
wrought
by
the
hands
of
the
apostles

and
if
there
were
miracles
wrought
then
why
has
god
ceased
to
be
a
god
of
miracles
and
yet
be
an
unchangeable
being
and
behold
i
say
unto
you
he
changeth
not
if
so
he
would
cease
to
be
god
and
he
ceaseth
not
to
be
god
and
is
a
god
of
miracles

and
the
reason
why
he
ceaseth
to
do
miracles
among
the
children
of
men
is
because
that
they
dwindle
in
unbelief
and
depart
from
the
right
way
and
know
not
the
god
in
whom
they
should
trust

behold
i
say
unto
you
that
whoso
believeth
in
christ
doubting
nothing
whatsoever
he
shall
ask
the
father
in
the
name
of
christ
it
shall
be
granted
him
and
this
promise
is
unto
all
even
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth

for
behold
thus
said
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
unto
his
disciples
who
should
tarry
yea
and
also
to
all
his
disciples
in
the
hearing
of
the
multitude
go
ye
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature

and
he
that
believeth
and
is
baptized
shall
be
saved
but
he
that
believeth
not
shall
be
damned

and
these
signs
shall
follow
them
that
believein
my
name
shall
they
cast
out
devils
they
shall
speak
with
new
tongues
they
shall
take
up
serpents
and
if
they
drink
any
deadly
thing
it
shall
not
hurt
them
they
shall
lay
hands
on
the
sick
and
they
shall
recover

and
whosoever
shall
believe
in
my
name
doubting
nothing
unto
him
will
i
confirm
all
my
words
even
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth

and
now
behold
who
can
stand
against
the
works
of
the
lord
who
can
deny
his
sayings
who
will
rise
up
against
the
almighty
power
of
the
lord
who
will
despise
the
works
of
the
lord
who
will
despise
the
children
of
christ
behold
all
ye
who
are
despisers
of
the
works
of
the
lord
for
ye
shall
wonder
and
perish

o
then
despise
not
and
wonder
not
but
hearken
unto
the
words
of
the
lord
and
ask
the
father
in
the
name
of
jesus
for
what
things
soever
ye
shall
stand
in
need
doubt
not
but
be
believing
and
begin
as
in
times
of
old
and
come
unto
the
lord
with
all
your
heart
and
work
out
your
own
salvation
with
fear
and
trembling
before
him

be
wise
in
the
days
of
your
probation
strip
yourselves
of
all
uncleanness
ask
not
that
ye
may
consume
it
on
your
lusts
but
ask
with
a
firmness
unshaken
that
ye
will
yield
to
no
temptation
but
that
ye
will
serve
the
true
and
living
god

see
that
ye
are
not
baptized
unworthily
see
that
ye
partake
not
of
the
sacrament
of
christ
unworthily
but
see
that
ye
do
all
things
in
worthiness
and
do
it
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
and
if
ye
do
this
and
endure
to
the
end
ye
will
in
nowise
be
cast
out

behold
i
speak
unto
you
as
though
i
spake
from
the
dead
for
i
know
that
ye
shall
have
my
words

condemn
me
not
because
of
mine
imperfection
neither
my
father
because
of
his
imperfection
neither
them
who
have
written
before
him
but
rather
give
thanks
unto
god
that
he
hath
made
manifest
unto
you
our
imperfections
that
ye
may
learn
to
be
more
wise
than
we
have
been

and
now
behold
we
have
written
this
record
according
to
our
knowledge
in
the
characters
which
are
called
among
us
the
reformed
egyptian
being
handed
down
and
altered
by
us
according
to
our
manner
of
speech

and
if
our
plates
had
been
sufficiently
large
we
should
have
written
in
hebrew
but
the
hebrew
hath
been
altered
by
us
also
and
if
we
could
have
written
in
hebrew
behold
ye
would
have
had
no
imperfection
in
our
record

but
the
lord
knoweth
the
things
which
we
have
written
and
also
that
none
other
people
knoweth
our
language
and
because
that
none
other
people
knoweth
our
language
therefore
he
hath
prepared
means
for
the
interpretation
thereof

and
these
things
are
written
that
we
may
rid
our
garments
of
the
blood
of
our
brethren
who
have
dwindled
in
unbelief

and
behold
these
things
which
we
have
desired
concerning
our
brethren
yea
even
their
restoration
to
the
knowledge
of
christ
are
according
to
the
prayers
of
all
the
saints
who
have
dwelt
in
the
land

and
may
the
lord
jesus
christ
grant
that
their
prayers
may
be
answered
according
to
their
faith
and
may
god
the
father
remember
the
covenant
which
he
hath
made
with
the
house
of
israel
and
may
he
bless
them
forever
through
faith
on
the
name
of
jesus
christ

came
forth
with
his
brother
and
their
families
with
some
others
and
their
families
from
the
great
tower
at
the
time
the
lord
confounded
the
language
of
the
people
and
swore
in
his
wrath
that
they
should
be
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
and
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
the
people
were
scattered

and
the
brother
of
jared
being
a
large
and
mighty
man
and
a
man
highly
favored
of
the
lord
jared
his
brother
said
unto
him
cry
unto
the
lord
that
he
will
not
confound
us
that
we
may
not
understand
our
words

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
jared
did
cry
unto
the
lord
and
the
lord
had
compassion
upon
jared
therefore
he
did
not
confound
the
language
of
jared
and
jared
and
his
brother
were
not
confounded

then
jared
said
unto
his
brother
cry
again
unto
the
lord
and
it
may
be
that
he
will
turn
away
his
anger
from
them
who
are
our
friends
that
he
confound
not
their
language

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
jared
did
cry
unto
the
lord
and
the
lord
had
compassion
upon
their
friends
and
their
families
also
that
they
were
not
confounded

and
it
came
to
pass
that
jared
spake
again
unto
his
brother
saying
go
and
inquire
of
the
lord
whether
he
will
drive
us
out
of
the
land
and
if
he
will
drive
us
out
of
the
land
cry
unto
him
whither
we
shall
go
and
who
knoweth
but
the
lord
will
carry
us
forth
into
a
land
which
is
choice
above
all
the
earth
and
if
it
so
be
let
us
be
faithful
unto
the
lord
that
we
may
receive
it
for

inheritance

and
it
came
to

that
the
brother
of
jared
did
cry
unto
the
lord
according
to
that
which
had
been
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
jared

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
did
hear
the
brother
of
jared
and
had
compassion
upon
him
and
said
unto
him

go
to
and
gather
together
thy
flocks
both
male
and
female
of
every
kind
and
also
of
the
seed
of
the
earth
of
every
kind
and
thy
families
and
also
jared
thy
brother
and
his
family
and
also
thy
friends
and
their
families
and
the
friends
of
jared
and
their
families

and
when
thou
hast
done
this
thou
shalt
go
at
the
head
of
them
down
into
the
valley
which
is
northward
and
there
will
i
meet
thee
and
i
will
go
before
thee
into
a
land
which
is
choice
above
all
the
lands
of
the
earth

and
there
will
i
bless
thee
and
thy
seed
and
raise
up
unto
me
of
thy
seed
and
of
the
seed
of
thy
brother
and
they
who
shall
go
with
thee
a
great
nation
and
there
shall
be
none
greater
than
the
nation
which
i
will
raise
up
unto
me
of
thy
seed
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
and
thus
i
will
do
unto
thee
because
this
long
time
ye
have
cried
unto
me
ether
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
jared
and
his
brother
and
their
families
and
also
the
friends
of
jared
and
his
brother
and
their
families
went
down
into
the
valley
which
was
northward
and
the
name
of
the
valley
was
nimrod
being
called
after
the
mighty
hunter
with
their
flocks
which
they
had
gathered
together
male
and
female
of
every
kind

and
they
did
also
lay
snares
and
catch
fowls
of
the
air
and
they
did
also
prepare
a
vessel
in
which
they
did
carry
with
them
the
fish
of
the
waters

and
they
did
also
carry
with
them
deseret
which
by
interpretation
is
a
honey
bee
and
thus
they
did
carry
with
them
swarms
of
bees
and
all
manner
of
that
which
was
upon
the
face
of
the
land
seeds
of
every
kind

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
come
down
into
the
valley
of
nimrod
the
lord
came
down
and
talked
with
the
brother
of
jared
and
he
was
in
a
cloud
and
the
brother
of
jared
saw
him
not

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
commanded
them
that
they
should
go
forth
into
the
wilderness
yea
into
that
quarter
where
there
never
had
man
been
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
did
go
before
them
and
did
talk
with
them
as
he
stood
in
a
cloud
and
gave
directions
whither
they
should
travel

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
travel
in
the
wilderness
and
did
build
barges
in
which
they
did
cross
many
waters
being
directed
continually
by
the
hand
of
the
lord

and
the
lord
would
not
suffer
that
they
should
stop
beyond
the
sea
in
the
wilderness
but
he
would
that
they
should
come
forth
even
unto
the
land
of
promise
which
was
choice
above
all
other
lands
which
the
lord
god
had
preserved
for
a
righteous
people

and
he
had
sworn
in
his
wrath
unto
the
brother
of
jared
that
whoso
should
possess
this
land
of
promise
from
that
time
henceforth
and
forever
should
serve
him
the
true
and
only
god
or
they
should
be
swept
off
when
the
fulness
of
his
wrath
should
come
upon
them

and
now
we
can
behold
the
decrees
of
god
concerning
this
land
that
it
is
a
land
of
promise
and
whatsoever
nation
shall
possess
it
shall
serve
god
or
they
shall
be
swept
off
when
the
fulness
of
his
wrath
shall
come
upon
them
and
the
fulness
of
his
wrath
cometh
upon
them
when
they
are
ripened
in
iniquity

for
behold
this
is
a
land
which
is
choice
above
all
other
lands
wherefore
he
that
doth
possess
it
shall
serve
god
or
shall
be
swept
off
for
it
is
the
everlasting
decree
of
god
and
it
is
not
until
the
fulness
of
iniquity
among
the
children
of
the
land
that
they
are
swept
off

and
this
cometh
unto
you
o
ye
gentiles
that
ye
may
know
the
decrees
of
godthat
ye
may
repent
and
not
continue
in
your
iniquities
until
the
fulness
come
that
ye
may
not
bring
down
the
fulness
of
the
wrath
of
god
upon
you
as
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
have
hitherto
done

behold
this
is
a
choice
land
and
whatsoever
nation
shall
possess
it
shall
be
free
from
bondage
and
from
captivity
and
from
all
other
nations
under
heaven
if
they
will
but
serve
the
god
of
the
land
who
is
jesus
christ
who
hath
been
manifested
by
the
things
which
we
have
written

and
now
i
proceed
with
my
record
for
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
did
bring
jared
and
his
brethren
forth
even
to
that
great
sea
which
divideth
the
lands
and
as
they
came
to
the
sea
they
pitched
their
tents
and
they
called
the
name
of
the
place
moriancumer
and
they
dwelt
in
tents
and
dwelt
in
tents
upon
the
seashore
for
the
space
of
four
years

and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
four
years
that
the
lord
came
again
unto
the
brother
of
jared
and
stood
in
a
cloud
and
talked
with
him
and
for
the
space
of
three
hours
did
the
lord
talk
with
the
brother
of
jared
and
chastened
him
because
he
remembered
not
to
call
upon
the
name
of
the
lord

and
the
brother
of
jared
repented
of
the
evil
which
he
had
done
and
did
call
upon
the
name
of
the
lord
for
his
brethren
who
were
with
him
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
i
will
forgive
thee
and
thy
brethren
of
their
sins
but
thou
shalt
not
sin
any
more
for
ye
shall
remember
that
my
spirit
will
not
always
strive
with
man
wherefore
if
ye
will
sin
until
ye
are
fully
ripe
ye
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
these
are
my
thoughts
upon
the
land
which
i
shall
give
you
for
your
inheritance
for
it
shall
be
a
land
choice
above
all
other
lands

and
the
lord
said
go
to
work
and
build
after
the
manner
of
barges
which
ye
have
hitherto
built
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
jared
did
go
to
work
and
also
his
brethren
and
built
barges
after
the
manner
which
they
had
built
according
to
the
instructions
of
the
lord
and
they
were
small
and
they
were
light
upon
the
water
even
like
unto
the
lightness
of
a
fowl
upon
the
water

and
they
were
built
after
a
manner
that
they
were
exceedingly
tight
even
that
they
would
hold
water
like
unto
a
dish
and
the
bottom
thereof
was
tight
like
unto
a
dish
and
the
sides
thereof
were
tight
like
unto
a
dish
and
the
ends
thereof
were
peaked
and
the
top
thereof
was
tight
like
unto
a
dish
and
the
length
thereof
was
the
length
of
a
tree
and
the
door
thereof
when
it
was
shut
was
tight
like
unto
a
dish

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
jared
cried
unto
the
lord
saying
o
lord
i
have
performed
the
work
which
thou
hast
commanded
me
and
i
have
made
the
barges
according
as
thou
hast
directed
me

and
behold
o
lord
in
them
there
is
no
light
whither
shall
we
steer
and
also
we
shall
perish
for
in
them
we
cannot
breathe
save
it
is
the
air
which
is
in
them
therefore
we
shall
perish

and
the
lord
said
unto
the
brother
of
jared
behold
thou
shalt
make
a
hole
in
the
top
and
also
in
the
bottom
and
when
thou
shalt
suffer
for
air
thou
shalt
unstop
the
hole
and
receive
air
and
if
it
be
so
that
the
water
come
in
upon
thee
behold
ye
shall
stop
the
hole
that
ye
may
not
perish
in
the
flood

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
jared
did
so
according
as
the
lord
had
commanded

and
he
cried
again
unto
the
lord
saying
o
lord
behold
i
have
done
even
as
thou
hast
commanded
me
and
i
have
prepared
the
vessels
for
my
people
and
behold
there
is
no
light
in
them
behold
o
lord
wilt
thou
suffer
that
we
shall
cross
this
great
water
in
darkness

and
the
lord
said
unto
the
brother
of
jared
what
will
ye
that
i
should
do
that
ye
may
have
light
in
your
vessels
for
behold
ye
cannot
have
windows
for
they
will
be
dashed
in
pieces
neither
shall
ye
take
fire
with
you
for
ye
shall
not
go
by
the
light
of
fire

for
behold
ye
shall
be
as
a
whale
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
for
the
mountain
waves
shall
dash
upon
you
nevertheless
i
will
bring
you
up
again
out
of
the
depths
of
the
sea
for
the
winds
have
gone
forth
out
of
my
mouth
and
also
the
rains
and
the
floods
have
i
sent
forth

and
behold
i
prepare
you
against
these
things
for
ye
cannot
cross
this
great
deep
save
i
prepare
you
against
the
waves
of
the
sea
and
the
winds
which
have
gone
forth
and
the
floods
which
shall
come
therefore
what
will
ye
that
i
should
prepare
for
you
that
ye
may
have
light
when
ye
are
swallowed
up
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
ether
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
jared
now
the
number
of
the
vessels
which
had
been
prepared
was
eight
went
forth
unto
the
mount
which
they
called
the
mount
shelem
because
of
its
exceeding
height
and
did
molten
out
of
a
rock
sixteen
small
stones
and
they
were
white
and
clear
even
as
transparent
glass
and
he
did
carry
them
in
his
hands
upon
the
top
of
the
mount
and
cried
again
unto
the
lord
saying

o
lord
thou
hast
said
that
we
must
be
encompassed
about
by
the
floods
now
behold
o
lord
and
do
not
be
angry
with
thy
servant
because
of
his
weakness
before
thee
for
we
know
that
thou
art
holy
and
dwellest
in
the
heavens
and
that
we
are
unworthy
before
thee
because
of
the
fall
our
natures
have
become
evil
continually
nevertheless
o
lord
thou
hast
given
us
a
commandment
that
we
must
call
upon
thee
that
from
thee
we
may
receive
according
to
our
desires

behold
o
lord
thou
hast
smitten
us
because
of
our
iniquity
and
hast
driven
us
forth
and
for
these
many
years
we
have
been
in
the
wilderness
nevertheless
thou
hast
been
merciful
unto
us
o
lord
look
upon
me
in
pity
and
turn
away
thine
anger
from
this
thy
people
and
suffer
not
that
they
shall
go
forth
across
this
raging
deep
in
darkness
but
behold
these
things
which
i
have
molten
out
of
the
rock

and
i
know
o
lord
that
thou
hast
all
power
and
can
do
whatsoever
thou
wilt
for
the
benefit
of
man
therefore
touch
these
stones
o
lord
with
thy
finger
and
prepare
them
that
they
may
shine
forth
in
darkness
and
they
shall
shine
forth
unto
us
in
the
vessels
which
we
have
prepared
that
we
may
have
light
while
we
shall
cross
the
sea

behold
o
lord
thou
canst
do
this
we
know
that
thou
art
able
to
show
forth
great
power
which
looks
small
unto
the
understanding
of
men

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
brother
of
jared
had
said
these
words
behold
the
lord
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
touched
the
stones
one
by
one
with
his
finger
and
the
veil
was
taken
from
off
the
eyes
of
the
brother
of
jared
and
he
saw
the
finger
of
the
lord
and
it
was
as
the
finger
of
a
man
like
unto
flesh
and
blood
and
the
brother
of
jared
fell
down
before
the
lord
for
he
was
struck
with
fear

and
the
lord
saw
that
the
brother
of
jared
had
fallen
to
the
earth
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
arise
why
hast
thou
fallen

and
he
saith
unto
the
lord
i
saw
the
finger
of
the
lord
and
i
feared
lest
he
should
smite
me
for
i
knew
not
that
the
lord
had
flesh
and
blood

and
the
lord
said
unto
him
because
of
thy
faith
thou
hast
seen
that
i
shall
take
upon
me
flesh
and
blood
and
never
has
man
come
before
me
with
such
exceeding
faith
as
thou
hast
for
were
it
not
so
ye
could
not
have
seen
my
finger
sawest
thou
more
than
this

and
he
answered
nay
lord
show
thyself
unto
me

and
the
lord
said
unto
him
believest
thou
the
words
which
i
shall
speak

and
he
answered
yea
lord
i
know
that
thou
speakest
the
truth
for
thou
art
a
god
of
truth
and
canst
not
lie

and
when
he
had
said
these
words
behold
the
lord
showed
himself
unto
him
and
said
because
thou
knowest
these
things
ye
are
redeemed
from
the
fall
therefore
ye
are
brought
back
into
my
presence
therefore
i
show
myself
unto
you

behold
i
am
he
who
was
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
to
redeem
my
people
behold
i
am
jesus
christ
i
am
the
father
and
the
son
in
me
shall
all
mankind
have
life
and
that
eternally
even
they
who
shall
believe
on
my
name
and
they
shall
become
my
sons
and
my
daughters

and
never
have
i
showed
myself
unto
man
whom
i
have
created
for
never
has
man
believed
in
me
as
thou
hast
seest
thou
that
ye
are
created
after
mine
own
image
yea
even
all
men
were
created
in
the
beginning
after
mine
own
image

behold
this
body
which
ye
now
behold
is
the
body
of
my
spirit
and
man
have
i
created
after
the
body
of
my
spirit
and
even
as
i
appear
unto
thee
to
be
in
the
spirit
will
i
appear
unto
my
people
in
the
flesh

and
now
as
i
moroni
said
i
could
not
make
a
full
account
of
these
things
which
are
written
therefore
it
sufficeth
me
to
say
that
jesus
showed
himself
unto
this
man
in
the
spirit
even
after
the
manner
and
in
the
likeness
of
the
same
body
even
as
he
showed
himself
unto
the
nephites

and
he
ministered
unto
him
even
as
he
ministered
unto
the
nephites
and
all
this
that
this
man
might
know
that
he
was
god
because
of
the
many
great
works
which
the
lord
had
showed
unto
him

and
because
of
the
knowledge
of
this
man
he
could
not
be
kept
from
beholding
within
the
veil
and
he
saw
the
finger
of
jesus
which
when
he
saw
he
fell
with
fear
for
he
knew
that
it
was
the
finger
of
the
lord
and
he
had
faith
no
longer
for
he
knew
nothing
doubting

wherefore
having
this
perfect
knowledge
of
god
he
could
not
be
kept
from
within
the
veil
therefore
he
saw
jesus
and
he
did
minister
unto
him

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
said
unto
the
brother
of
jared
behold
thou
shalt
not
suffer
these
things
which
ye
have
seen
and
heard
to
go
forth
unto
the
world
until
the
time
cometh
that
i
shall
glorify
my
name
in
the
flesh
wherefore
ye
shall
treasure
up
the
things
which
ye
have
seen
and
heard
and
show
it
to
no
man

and
behold
when
ye
shall
come
unto
me
ye
shall
write
them
and
shall
seal
them
up
that
no
one
can
interpret
them
for
ye
shall
write
them
in
a
language
that
they
cannot
be
read

and
behold
these
two
stones
will
i
give
unto
thee
and
ye
shall
seal
them
up
also
with
the
things
which
ye
shall
write

for
behold
the
language
which
ye
shall
write
i
have
confounded
wherefore
i
will
cause
in
my
own
due
time
that
these
stones
shall
magnify
to
the
eyes
of
men
these
things
which
ye
shall
write

and
when
the
lord
had
said
these
words
he
showed
unto
the
brother
of
jared
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
which
had
been
and
also
all
that
would
be
and
he
withheld
them
not
from
his
sight
even
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth

for
he
had
said
unto
him
in
times
before
that
if
he
would
believe
in
him
that
he
could
show
unto
him
all
thingsit
should
be
shown
unto
him
therefore
the
lord
could
not
withhold
anything
from
him
for
he
knew
that
the
lord
could
show
him
all
things

and
the
lord
said
unto
him
write
these
things
and
seal
them
up
and
i
will
show
them
in
mine
own
due
time
unto
the
children
of
men

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
commanded
him
that
he
should
seal
up
the
two
stones
which
he
had
received
and
show
them
not
until
the
lord
should
show
them
unto
the
children
of
men
ether
chapter


and
the
lord
commanded
the
brother
of
jared
to
go
down
out
of
the
mount
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
write
the
things
which
he
had
seen
and
they
were
forbidden
to
come
unto
the
children
of
men
until
after
that
he
should
be
lifted
up
upon
the
cross
and
for
this
cause
did
king
mosiah
keep
them
that
they
should
not
come
unto
the
world
until
after
christ
should
show
himself
unto
his
people

and
after
christ
truly
had
showed
himself
unto
his
people
he
commanded
that
they
should
be
made
manifest

and
now
after
that
they
have
all
dwindled
in
unbelief
and
there
is
none
save
it
be
the
lamanites
and
they
have
rejected
the
gospel
of
christ
therefore
i
am
commanded
that
i
should
hide
them
up
again
in
the
earth

behold
i
have
written
upon
these
plates
the
very
things
which
the
brother
of
jared
saw
and
there
never
were
greater
things
made
manifest
than
those
which
were
made
manifest
unto
the
brother
of
jared

wherefore
the
lord
hath
commanded
me
to
write
them
and
i
have
written
them
and
he
commanded
me
that
i
should
seal
them
up
and
he
also
hath
commanded
that
i
should
seal
up
the
interpretation
thereof
wherefore
i
have
sealed
up
the
interpreters
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
lord

for
the
lord
said
unto
me
they
shall
not
go
forth
unto
the
gentiles
until
the
day
that
they
shall
repent
of
their
iniquity
and
become
clean
before
the
lord

and
in
that
day
that
they
shall
exercise
faith
in
me
saith
the
lord
even
as
the
brother
of
jared
did
that
they
may
become
sanctified
in
me
then
will
i
manifest
unto
them
the
things
which
the
brother
of
jared
saw
even
to
the
unfolding
unto
them
all
my
revelations
saith
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
the
father
of
the
heavens
and
of
the
earth
and
all
things
that
in
them
are

and
he
that
will
contend
against
the
word
of
the
lord
let
him
be
accursed
and
he
that
shall
deny
these
things
let
him
be
accursed
for
unto
them
will
i
show
no
greater
things
saith
jesus
christ
for
i
am
he
who
speaketh

and
at
my
command
the
heavens
are
opened
and
are
shut
and
at
my
word
the
earth
shall
shake
and
at
my
command
the
inhabitants
thereof
shall
pass
away
even
so
as
by
fire

and
he
that
believeth
not
my
words
believeth
not
my
disciples
and
if
it
so
be
that
i
do
not
speak
judge
ye
for
ye
shall
know
that
it
is
i
that
speaketh
at
the
last
day

but
he
that
believeth
these
things
which
i
have
spoken
him
will
i
visit
with
the
manifestations
of
my
spirit
and
he
shall
know
and
bear
record
for
because
of
my
spirit
he
shall
know
that
these

amen
ether
chapter


and
now
i
moroni
proceed
to
give
the
record
of
jared
and
his
brother

for
it
came
to
pass
after
the
lord
had
prepared
the
stones
which
the
brother
of
jared
had
carried
up
into
the
mount
the
brother
of
jared
came
down
out
of
the
mount
and
he
did
put
forth
the
stones
into
the
vessels
which
were
prepared
one
in
each
end
thereof
and
behold
they
did
give
light
unto
the
vessels

and
thus
the
lord
caused
stones
to
shine
in
darkness
to
give
light
unto
men
women
and
children
that
they
might
not
cross
the
great
waters
in
darkness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
prepared
all
manner
of
food
that
thereby
they
might
subsist
upon
the
water
and
also
food
for
their
flocks
and
herds
and
whatsoever
beast
or
animal
or
fowl
that
they
should
carry
with
themand
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
done
all
these
things
they
got
aboard
of
their
vessels
or
barges
and
set
forth
into
the
sea
commending
themselves
unto
the
lord
their
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
god
caused
that
there
should
be
a
furious
wind
blow
upon
the
face
of
the
waters
towards
the
promised
land
and
thus
they
were
tossed
upon
the
waves
of
the
sea
before
the
wind

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
many
times
buried
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
because
of
the
mountain
waves
which
broke
upon
them
and
also
the
great
and
terrible
tempests
which
were
caused
by
the
fierceness
of
the
wind

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
were
buried
in
the
deep
there
was
no
water
that
could
hurt
them
their
vessels
being
tight
like
unto
a
dish
and
also
they
were
tight
like
unto
the
ark
of
noah
therefore
when
they
were
encompassed
about
by
many
waters
they
did
cry
unto
the
lord
and
he
did
bring
them
forth
again
upon
the
top
of
the
waters

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
wind
did
never
cease
to
blow
towards
the
promised
land
while
they
were
upon
the
waters
and
thus
they
were
driven
forth
before
the
wind

and
they
did
sing
praises
unto
the
lord
yea
the
brother
of
jared
did
sing
praises
unto
the
lord
and
he
did
thank
and
praise
the
lord
all
the
day
long
and
when
the
night
came
they
did
not
cease
to
praise
the
lord

and
thus
they
were
driven
forth
and
no
monster
of
the
sea
could
break
them
neither
whale
that
could
mar
them
and
they
did
have
light
continually
whether
it
was
above
the
water
or
under
the
water

and
thus
they
were
driven
forth
three
hundred
and
forty
and
four
days
upon
the
water

and
they
did
land
upon
the
shore
of
the
promised
land
and
when
they
had
set
their
feet
upon
the
shores
of
the
promised
land
they
bowed
themselves
down
upon
the
face
of
the
land
and
did
humble
themselves
before
the
lord
and
did
shed
tears
of
joy
before
the
lord
because
of
the
multitude
of
his
tender
mercies
over
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
land
and
began
to
till
the
earth

and
jared
had
four
sons
and
they
were
called
jacom
and
gilgah
and
mahah
and
orihah

and
the
brother
of
jared
also
begat
sons
and
daughters

and
the
friends
of
jared
and
his
brother
were
in
number
about
twenty
and
two
souls
and
they
also
begat
sons
and
daughters
before
they
came
to
the
promised
land
and
therefore
they
began
to
be
many

and
they
were
taught
to
walk
humbly
before
the
lord
and
they
were
also
taught
from
on
high

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
began
to
spread
upon
the
face
of
the
land
and
to
multiply
and
to
till
the
earth
and
they
did
wax
strong
in
the
land

and
the
brother
of
jared
began
to
be
old
and
saw
that
he
must
soon
go
down
to
the
grave
wherefore
he
said
unto
jared
let
us
gather
together
our
people
that
we
may
number
them
that
we
may
know
of
them
what
they
will
desire
of
us
before
we
go
down
to
our
graves

and
accordingly
the
people
were
gathered
together
now
the
number
of
the
sons
and
the
daughters
of
the
brother
of
jared
were
twenty
and
two
souls
and
the
number
of
sons
and
daughters
of
jared
were
twelve
he
having
four
sons

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
number
their
people
and
after
that
they
had
numbered
them
they
did
desire
of
them
the
things
which
they
would
that
they
should
do
before
they
went
down
to
their
graves

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
desired
of
them
that
they
should
anoint
one
of
their
sons
to
be
a
king
over
them

and
now
behold
this
was
grievous
unto
them
and
the
brother
of
jared
said
unto
them
surely
this
thing
leadeth
into
captivity

but
jared
said
unto
his
brother
suffer
them
that
they
may
have
a
king
and
therefore
he
said
unto
them
choose
ye
out
from
among
our
sons
a
king
even
whom
ye
will

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
chose
even
the
firstborn
of
the
brother
of
jared
and
his
name
was
pagag
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
refused
and
would
not
be
their
king
and
the
people
would
that
his
father
should
constrain
him
but
his
father
would
not
and
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
constrain
no
man
to
be
their
king

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
chose
all
the
brothers
of
pagag
and
they
would
not

and
it
came
to
pass
that
neither
would
the
sons
of
jared
even
all
save
it
were
one
and
orihah
was
anointed
to
be
king
over
the
people

and
he
began
to
reign
and
the
people
began
to
prosper
and
they
became
exceedingly
rich

and
it
came
to
pass
that
jared
died
and
his
brother
also

and
it
came
to
pass
that
orihah
did
walk
humbly
before
the
lord
and
did
remember
how
great
things
the
lord
had
done
for
his
father
and
also
taught
his
people
how
great
things
the
lord
had
done
for
their
fathers
ether
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
orihah
did
execute
judgment
upon
the
land
in
righteousness
all
his
days
whose
days
were
exceedingly
many

and
he
begat
sons
and
daughters
yea
he
begat
thirty
and
one
among
whom
were
twenty
and
three
sons

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
also
begat
kib
in
his
old
age
and
it
came
to
pass
that
kib
reigned
in
his
stead
and
kib
begat
corihor

and
when
corihor
was
thirty
and
two
years
old
he
rebelled
against
his
father
and
went
over
and
dwelt
in
the
land
of
nehor
and
he
begat
sons
and
daughters
and
they
became
exceedingly
fair
wherefore
corihor
drew
away
many
people
after
him

and
when
he
had
gathered
together
an
army
he
came
up
unto
the
land
of
moron
where
the
king
dwelt
and
took
him
captive
which
brought
to
pass
the
saying
of
the
brother
of
jared
that
they
would
be
brought
into
captivity

now
the
land
of
moron
where
the
king
dwelt
was
near
the
land
which
is
called
desolation
by
the
nephites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
kib
dwelt
in
captivity
and
his
people
under
corihor
his
son
until
he
became
exceedingly
old
nevertheless
kib
begat
shule
in
his
old
age
while
he
was
yet
in
captivity

and
it
came
to
pass
that
shule
was
angry
with
his
brother
and
shule
waxed
strong
and
became
mighty
as
to
the
strength
of
a
man
and
he
was
also
mighty
in
judgment

wherefore
he
came
to
the
hill
ephraim
and
he
did
molten
out
of
the
hill
and
made
swords
out
of
steel
for
those
whom
he
had
drawn
away
with
him
and
after
he
had
armed
them
with
swords
he
returned
to
the
city
nehor
and
gave
battle
unto
his
brother
corihor
by
which
means
he
obtained
the
kingdom
and
restored
it
unto
his
father
kib

and
now
because
of
the
thing
which
shule
had
done
his
father
bestowed
upon
him
the
kingdom
therefore
he
began
to
reign
in
the
stead
of
his
father

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
execute
judgment
in
righteousness
and
he
did
spread
his
kingdom
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
for
the
people
had
become
exceedingly
numerous

and
it
came
to
pass
that
shule
also
begat
many
sons
and
daughters

and
corihor
repented
of
the
many
evils
which
he
had
done
wherefore
shule
gave
him
power
in
his
kingdom

and
it
came
to
pass
that
corihor
had
many
sons
and
daughters
and
among
the
sons
of
corihor
there
was
one
whose
name
was
noah

and
it
came
to
pass
that
noah
rebelled
against
shule
the
king
and
also
his
father
corihor
and
drew
away
cohor
his
brother
and
also
all
his
brethren
and
many
of
the
people

and
he
gave
battle
unto
shule
the
king
in
which
he
did
obtain
the
land
of
their
first
inheritance
and
he
became
a
king
over
that
part
of
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
gave
battle
again
unto
shule
the
king
and
he
took
shule
the
king
and
carried
him
away
captive
into
moron

and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
about
to
put
him
to
death
the
sons
of
shule
crept
into
the
house
of
noah
by
night
and
slew
him
and
broke
down
the
door
of
the
prison
and
brought
out
their
father
and
placed
him
upon
his
throne
in
his
own
kingdom

wherefore
the
son
of
noah
did
build
up
his
kingdom
in
his
stead
nevertheless
they
did
not
gain
power
any
more
over
shule
the
king
and
the
people
who
were
under
the
reign
of
shule
the
king
did
prosper
exceedingly
and
wax
great

and
the
country
was
divided
and
there
were
two
kingdoms
the
kingdom
of
shule
and
the
kingdom
of
cohor
the
son
of
noah

and
cohor
the
son
of
noah
caused
that
his
people
should
give
battle
unto
shule
in
which
shule
did
beat
them
and
did
slay
cohor

and
now
cohor
had
a
son
who
was
called
nimrod
and
nimrod
gave
up
the
kingdom
of
cohor
unto
shule
and
he
did
gain
favor
in
the
eyes
of
shule
wherefore
shule
did
bestow
great
favors
upon
him
and
he
did
do
in
the
kingdom
of
shule
according
to
his
desires

and
also
in
the
reign
of
shule
there
came
prophets
among
the
people
who
were
sent
from
the
lord
prophesying
that
the
wickedness
and
idolatry
of
the
people
was
bringing
a
curse
upon
the
land
and
they
should
be
destroyed
if
they
did
not
repent

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
did
revile
against
the
prophets
and
did
mock
them
and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
shule
did
execute
judgment
against
all
those
who
did
revile
against
the
prophets

and
he
did
execute
a
law
throughout
all
the
land
which
gave
power
unto
the
prophets
that
they
should
go
whithersoever
they
would
and
by
this
cause
the
people
were
brought
unto
repentance

and
because
the
people
did
repent
of
their
iniquities
and
idolatries
the
lord
did
spare
them
and
they
began
to
prosper
again
in
the
land
and
it
came
to
pass
that
shule
begat
sons
and
daughters
in
his
old
age

and
there
were
no
more
wars
in
the
days
of
shule
and
he
remembered
the
great
things
that
the
lord
had
done
for
his
fathers
in
bringing
them
across
the
great
deep
into
the
promised
land
wherefore
he
did
execute
judgment
in
righteousness
all
his
days
ether
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
begat
omer
and
omer
reigned
in
his
stead
and
omer
begat
jared
and
jared
begat
sons
and
daughters

and
jared
rebelled
against
his
father
and
came
and
dwelt
in
the
land
of
heth
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
flatter
many
people
because
of
his
cunning
words
until
he
had
gained
the
half
of
the
kingdom

and
when
he
had
gained
the
half
of
the
kingdom
he
gave
battle
unto
his
father
and
he
did
carry
away
his
father
into
captivity
and
did
make
him
serve
in
captivity

and
now
in
the
days
of
the
reigns
of
omer
he
was
in
captivity
the
half
of
his
days
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
begat
sons
and
daughters
among
whom
were
esrom
and
coriantumr

and
they
were
exceedingly
angry
because
of
the
doings
of
jared
their
brother
insomuch
that
they
did
raise
an
army
and
gave
battle
unto
jared
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
give
battle
unto
him
by
night

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
slain
the
army
of
jared
they
were
about
to
slay
him
also
and
he
plead
with
them
that
they
would
not
slay
him
and
he
would
give
up
the
kingdom
unto
his
father
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
grant
unto
him
his
life

and
now
jared
became
exceedingly
sorrowful
because
of
the
loss
of
the
kingdom
for
he
had
set
his
heart
upon
the
kingdom
and
upon
the
glory
of
the
world

now
the
daughter
of
jared
being
exceedingly
expert
and
seeing
the
sorrows
of
her
father
thought
to
devise
a
plan
whereby
she
could
redeem
the
kingdom
unto
her
father

now
the
daughter
of
jared
was
exceedingly
fair
and
it
came
to
pass
that
she
did
talk
with
her
father
and
said
unto
him
whereby
hath
my
father
so
much
sorrow
hath
he
not
read
the
record
which
our
fathers
brought
across
the
great
deep
behold
is
there
not
an
account
concerning
them
of
old
that
they
by
their
secret
plans
did
obtain
kingdoms
and
great
glory

and
now
therefore
let
my
father
send
for
akish
the
son
of
kimnor
and
behold
i
am
fair
and
i
will
dance
before
him
and
i
will
please
him
that
he
will
desire
me
to
wife
wherefore
if
he
shall
desire
of
thee
that
ye
shall
give
unto
him
me
to
wife
then
shall
ye
say
i
will
give
her
if
ye
will
bring
unto
me
the
head
of
my
father
the
king

and
now
omer
was
a
friend
to
akish
wherefore
when
jared
had
sent
for
akish
the
daughter
of
jared
danced
before
him
that
she
pleased
him
insomuch
that
he
desired
her
to
wife
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
unto
jared
give
her
unto
me
to
wife

and
jared
said
unto
him
i
will
give
her
unto
you
if
ye
will
bring
unto
me
the
head
of
my
father
the
king

and
it
came
to
pass
that
akish
gathered
in
unto
the
house
of
jared
all
his
kinsfolk
and
said
unto
them
will
ye
swear
unto
me
that
ye
will
be
faithful
unto
me
in
the
thing
which
i
shall
desire
of
you

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
all
sware
unto
him
by
the
god
of
heaven
and
also
by
the
heavens
and
also
by
the
earth
and
by
their
heads
that
whoso
should
vary
from
the
assistance
which
akish
desired
should
lose
his
head
and
whoso
should
divulge
whatsoever
thing
akish
made
known
unto
them
the
same
should
lose
his
life

and
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
they
did
agree
with
akish
and
akish
did
administer
unto
them
the
oaths
which
were
given
by
them
of
old
who
also
sought
power
which
had
been
handed
down
even
from
cain
who
was
a
murderer
from
the
beginning

and
they
were
kept
up
by
the
power
of
the
devil
to
administer
these
oaths
unto
the
people
to
keep
them
in
darkness
to
help
such
as
sought
power
to
gain
power
and
to
murder
and
to
plunder
and
to
lie
and
to
commit
all
manner
of
wickedness
and
whoredoms

and
it
was
the
daughter
of
jared
who
put
it
into
his
heart
to
search
up
these
things
of
old
and
jared
put
it
into
the
heart
of
akish
wherefore
akish
administered
it
unto
his
kindred
and
friends
leading
them
away
by
fair
promises
to
do
whatsoever
thing
he
desired

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
formed
a
secret
combination
even
as
they
of
old
which
combination
is
most
abominable
and
wicked
above
all
in
the
sight
of
god

for
the
lord
worketh
not
in
secret
combinations
neither
doth
he
will
that
man
should
shed
blood
but
in
all
things
hath
forbidden
it
from
the
beginning
of
man

and
now
i
moroni
do
not
write
the
manner
of
their
oaths
and
combinations
for
it
hath
been
made
known
unto
me
that
they
are
had
among
all
people
and
they
are
had
among
the
lamanites

and
they
have
caused
the
destruction
of
this
people
of
whom
i
am
now
speaking
and
also
the
destruction
of
the
people
of
nephi

and
whatsoever
nation
shall
uphold
such
secret
combinations
to
get
power
and
gain
until
they
shall
spread
over
the
nation
behold
they
shall
be
destroyed
for
the
lord
will
not
suffer
that
the
blood
of
his
saints
which
shall
be
shed
by
them
shall
always
cry
unto
him
from
the
ground
for
vengeance
upon
them
and
yet
he
avenge
them
not

wherefore
o
ye
gentiles
it
is
wisdom
in
god
that
these
things
should
be
shown
unto
you
that
thereby
ye
may
repent
of
your
sins
and
suffer
not
that
these
murderous
combinations
shall
get
above
you
which
are
built
up
to
get
power
and
gainand
the
work
yea
even
the
work
of
destruction
come
upon
you
yea
even
the
sword
of
the
justice
of
the
eternal
god
shall
fall
upon
you
to
your
overthrow
and
destruction
if
ye
shall
suffer
these
things
to
be

wherefore
the
lord
commandeth
you
when
ye
shall
see
these
things
come
among
you
that
ye
shall
awake
to
a
sense
of
your
awful
situation
because
of
this
secret
combination
which
shall
be
among
you
or
wo
be
unto
it
because
of
the
blood
of
them
who
have
been
slain
for
they
cry
from
the
dust
for
vengeance
upon
it
and
also
upon
those
who
built
it
up

for
it
cometh
to
pass
that
whoso
buildeth
it
up
seeketh
to
overthrow
the
freedom
of
all
lands
nations
and
countries
and
it
bringeth
to
pass
the
destruction
of
all
people
for
it
is
built
up
by
the
devil
who
is
the
father
of
all
lies
even
that
same
liar
who
beguiled
our
first
parents
yea
even
that
same
liar
who
hath
caused
man
to
commit
murder
from
the
beginning
who
hath
hardened
the
hearts
of
men
that
they
have
murdered
the
prophets
and
stoned
them
and
cast
them
out
from
the
beginning

wherefore
i
moroni
am
commanded
to
write
these
things
that
evil
may
be
done
away
and
that
the
time
may
come
that
satan
may
have
no
power
upon
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
but
that
they
may
be
persuaded
to
do
good
continually
that
they
may
come
unto
the
fountain
of
all
righteousness
and
be
saved
ether
chapter


and
now
i
moroni
proceed
with
my
record
therefore
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
because
of
the
secret
combinations
of
akish
and
his
friends
behold
they
did
overthrow
the
kingdom
of
omer

nevertheless
the
lord
was
merciful
unto
omer
and
also
to
his
sons
and
to
his
daughters
who
did
not
seek
his
destruction

and
the
lord
warned
omer
in
a
dream
that
he
should
depart
out
of
the
land
wherefore
omer
departed
out
of
the
land
with
his
family
and
traveled
many
days
and
came
over
and
passed
by
the
hill
of
shim
and
came
over
by
the
place
where
the
nephites
were
destroyed
and
from
thence
eastward
and
came
to
a
place
which
was
called
ablom
by
the
seashore
and
there
he
pitched
his
tent
and
also
his
sons
and
his
daughters
and
all
his
household
save
it
were
jared
and
his
family

and
it
came
to
pass
that
jared
was
anointed
king
over
the
people
by
the
hand
of
wickedness
and
he
gave
unto
akish
his
daughter
to
wife

and
it
came
to
pass
that
akish
sought
the
life
of
his
fatherinlaw
and
he
applied
unto
those
whom
he
had
sworn
by
the
oath
of
the
ancients
and
they
obtained
the
head
of
his
fatherinlaw
as
he
sat
upon
his
throne
giving
audience
to
his
people

for
so
great
had
been
the
spreading
of
this
wicked
and
secret
society
that
it
had
corrupted
the
hearts
of
all
the
people
therefore
jared
was
murdered
upon
his
throne
and
akish
reigned
in
his
stead

and
it
came
to
pass
that
akish
began
to
be
jealous
of
his
son
therefore
he
shut
him
up
in
prison
and
kept
him
upon
little
or
no
food
until
he
had
suffered
death

and
now
the
brother
of
him
that
suffered
death
and
his
name
was
nimrah
was
angry
with
his
father
because
of
that
which
his
father
had
done
unto
his
brother

and
it
came
to
pass
that
nimrah
gathered
together
a
small
number
of
men
and
fled
out
of
the
land
and
came
over
and
dwelt
with
omer

and
it
came
to
pass
that
akish
begat
other
sons
and
they
won
the
hearts
of
the
people
notwithstanding
they
had
sworn
unto
him
to
do
all
manner
of
iniquity
according
to
that
which
he
desired

now
the
people
of
akish
were
desirous
for
gain
even
as
akish
was
desirous
for
power
wherefore
the
sons
of
akish
did
offer
them
money
by
which
means
they
drew
away
the
more
part
of
the
people
after
them

and
there
began
to
be
a
war
between
the
sons
of
akish
and
akish
which
lasted
for
the
space
of
many
years
yea
unto
the
destruction
of
nearly
all
the
people
of
the
kingdom
yea
even
all
save
it
were
thirty
souls
and
they
who
fled
with
the
house
of
omer

wherefore
omer
was
restored
again
to
the
land
of
his
inheritance

and
it
came
to
pass
that
omer
began
to
be
old
nevertheless
in
his
old
age
he
begat
emer
and
he
anointed
emer
to
be
king
to
reign
in
his
stead

and
after
that
he
had
anointed
emer
to
be
king
he
saw
peace
in
the
land
for
the
space
of
two
years
and
he
died
having
seen
exceedingly
many
days
which
were
full
of
sorrow
and
it
came
to
pass
that
emer
did
reign
in
his
stead
and
did
fill
the
steps
of
his
father

and
the
lord
began
again
to
take
the
curse
from
off
the
land
and
the
house
of
emer
did
prosper
exceedingly
under
the
reign
of
emer
and
in
the
space
of
sixty
and
two
years
they
had
become
exceedingly
strong
insomuch
that
they
became
exceedingly
rich

having
all
manner
of
fruit
and
of
grain
and
of
silks
and
of
fine
linen
and
of
gold
and
of
silver
and
of
precious
things

and
also
all
manner
of
cattle
of
oxen
and
cows
and
of
sheep
and
of
swine
and
of
goats
and
also
many
other
kinds
of
animals
which
were
useful
for
the
food
of
man

and
they
also
had
horses
and
asses
and
there
were
elephants
and
cureloms
and
cumoms
all
of
which
were
useful
unto
man
and
more
especially
the
elephants
and
cureloms
and
cumoms

and
thus
the
lord
did
pour
out
his
blessings
upon
this
land
which
was
choice
above
all
other
lands
and
he
commanded
that
whoso
should
possess
the
land
should
possess
it
unto
the
lord
or
they
should
be
destroyed
when
they
were
ripened
in
iniquity
for
upon
such
saith
the
lord
i
will
pour
out
the
fulness
of
my
wrath

and
emer
did
execute
judgment
in
righteousness
all
his
days
and
he
begat
many
sons
and
daughters
and
he
begat
coriantum
and
he
anointed
coriantum
to
reign
in
his
stead

and
after
he
had
anointed
coriantum
to
reign
in
his
stead
he
lived
four
years
and
he
saw
peace
in
the
land
yea
and
he
even
saw
the
son
of
righteousness
and
did
rejoice
and
glory
in
his
day
and
he
died
in
peace

and
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantum
did
walk
in
the
steps
of
his
father
and
did
build
many
mighty
cities
and
did
administer
that
which
was
good
unto
his
people
in
all
his
days
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
had
no
children
even
until
he
was
exceedingly
old

and
it
came
to
pass
that
his
wife
died
being
an
hundred
and
two
years
old
and
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantum
took
to
wife
in
his
old
age
a
young
maid
and
begat
sons
and
daughters
wherefore
he
lived
until
he
was
an
hundred
and
forty
and
two
years
old

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
begat
com
and
com
reigned
in
his
stead
and
he
reigned
forty
and
nine
years
and
he
begat
heth
and
he
also
begat
other
sons
and
daughters

and
the
people
had
spread
again
over
all
the
face
of
the
land
and
there
began
again
to
be
an
exceedingly
great
wickedness
upon
the
face
of
the
land
and
heth
began
to
embrace
the
secret
plans
again
of
old
to
destroy
his
father

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
dethrone
his
father
for
he
slew
him
with
his
own
sword
and
he
did
reign
in
his
stead

and
there
came
prophets
in
the
land
again
crying
repentance
unto
themthat
they
must
prepare
the
way
of
the
lord
or
there
should
come
a
curse
upon
the
face
of
the
land
yea
even
there
should
be
a
great
famine
in
which
they
should
be
destroyed
if
they
did
not
repent

but
the
people
believed
not
the
words
of
the
prophets
but
they
cast
them
out
and
some
of
them
they
cast
into
pits
and
left
them
to
perish
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
all
these
things
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
king
heth

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
began
to
be
a
great
dearth
upon
the
land
and
the
inhabitants
began
to
be
destroyed
exceedingly
fast
because
of
the
dearth
for
there
was
no
rain
upon
the
face
of
the
earth

and
there
came
forth
poisonous
serpents
also
upon
the
face
of
the
land
and
did
poison
many
people
and
it
came
to
pass
that
their
flocks
began
to
flee
before
the
poisonous
serpents
towards
the
land
southward
which
was
called
by
the
nephites
zarahemla

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
of
them
which
did
perish
by
the
way
nevertheless
there
were
some
which
fled
into
the
land
southward

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
did
cause
the
serpents
that
they
should
pursue
them
no
more
but
that
they
should
hedge
up
the
way
that
the
people
could
not
pass
that
whoso
should
attempt
to
pass
might
fall
by
the
poisonous
serpents

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
did
follow
the
course
of
the
beasts
and
did
devour
the
carcasses
of
them
which
fell
by
the
way
until
they
had
devoured
them
all
now
when
the
people
saw
that
they
must
perish
they
began
to
repent
of
their
iniquities
and
cry
unto
the
lord

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
humbled
themselves
sufficiently
before
the
lord
he
did
send
rain
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
the
people
began
to
revive
again
and
there
began
to
be
fruit
in
the
north
countries
and
in
all
the
countries
round
about
and
the
lord
did
show
forth
his
power
unto
them
in
preserving
them
from
famine
ether
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
shez
who
was
a
descendant
of
hethfor
heth
had
perished
by
the
famine
and
all
his
household
save
it
were
shezwherefore
shez
began
to
build
up
again
a
broken
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
shez
did
remember
the
destruction
of
his
fathers
and
he
did
build
up
a
righteous
kingdom
for
he
remembered
what
the
lord
had
done
in
bringing
jared
and
his
brother
across
the
deep
and
he
did
walk
in
the
ways
of
the
lord
and
he
begat
sons
and
daughters

and
his
eldest
son
whose
name
was
shez
did
rebel
against
him
nevertheless
shez
was
smitten
by
the
hand
of
a
robber
because
of
his
exceeding
riches
which
brought
peace
again
unto
his
father

and
it
came
to
pass
that
his
father
did
build
up
many
cities
upon
the
face
of
the
land
and
the
people
began
again
to
spread
over
all
the
face
of
the
land
and
shez
did
live
to
an
exceedingly
old
age
and
he
begat
riplakish
and
he
died
and
riplakish
reigned
in
his
stead

and
it
came
to
pass
that
riplakish
did
not
do
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
for
he
did
have
many
wives
and
concubines
and
did
lay
that
upon
mens
shoulders
which
was
grievous
to
be
borne
yea
he
did
tax
them
with
heavy
taxes
and
with
the
taxes
he
did
build
many
spacious
buildings

and
he
did
erect
him
an
exceedingly
beautiful
throne
and
he
did
build
many
prisons
and
whoso
would
not
be
subject
unto
taxes
he
did
cast
into
prison
and
whoso
was
not
able
to
pay
taxes
he
did
cast
into
prison
and
he
did
cause
that
they
should
labor
continually
for
their
support
and
whoso
refused
to
labor
he
did
cause
to
be
put
to
death

wherefore
he
did
obtain
all
his
fine
work
yea
even
his
fine
gold
he
did
cause
to
be
refined
in
prison
and
all
manner
of
fine
workmanship
he
did
cause
to
be
wrought
in
prison
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
afflict
the
people
with
his
whoredoms
and
abominations

and
when
he
had
reigned
for
the
space
of
forty
and
two
years
the
people
did
rise
up
in
rebellion
against
him
and
there
began
to
be
war
again
in
the
land
insomuch
that
riplakish
was
killed
and
his
descendants
were
driven
out
of
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
after
the
space
of
many
years
morianton
he
being
a
descendant
of
riplakish
gathered
together
an
army
of
outcasts
and
went
forth
and
gave
battle
unto
the
people
and
he
gained
power
over
many
cities
and
the
war
became
exceedingly
sore
and
did
last
for
the
space
of
many
years
and
he
did
gain
power
over
all
the
land
and
did
establish
himself
king
over
all
the
land

and
after
that
he
had
established
himself
king
he
did
ease
the
burden
of
the
people
by
which
he
did
gain
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
and
they
did
anoint
him
to
be
their
king

and
he
did
do
justice
unto
the
people
but
not
unto
himself
because
of
his
many
whoredoms
wherefore
he
was
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord

and
it
came
to
pass
that
morianton
built
up
many
cities
and
the
people
became
exceedingly
rich
under
his
reign
both
in
buildings
and
in
gold
and
silver
and
in
raising
grain
and
in
flocks
and
herds
and
such
things
which
had
been
restored
unto
them

and
morianton
did
live
to
an
exceedingly
great
age
and
then
he
begat
kim
and
kim
did
reign
in
the
stead
of
his
father
and
he
did
reign
eight
years
and
his
father
died
and
it
came
to
pass
that
kim
did
not
reign
in
righteousness
wherefore
he
was
not
favored
of
the
lord

and
his
brother
did
rise
up
in
rebellion
against
him
by
which
he
did
bring
him
into
captivity
and
he
did
remain
in
captivity
all
his
days
and
he
begat
sons
and
daughters
in
captivity
and
in
his
old
age
he
begat
levi
and
he
died

and
it
came
to
pass
that
levi
did
serve
in
captivity
after
the
death
of
his
father
for
the
space
of
forty
and
two
years
and
he
did
make
war
against
the
king
of
the
land
by
which
he
did
obtain
unto
himself
the
kingdom

and
after
he
had
obtained
unto
himself
the
kingdom
he
did
that
which
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
the
people
did
prosper
in
the
land
and
he
did
live
to
a
good
old
age
and
begat
sons
and
daughters
and
he
also
begat
corom
whom
he
anointed
king
in
his
stead

that
which
was
good
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
all
his
days
and
he
begat
many
sons
and
daughters
and
after
he
had
seen
many
days
he
did
pass
away
even
like
unto
the
rest
of
the
earth
and
kish
reigned
in
his
stead

and
it
came
to
pass
that
kish
passed
away
also
and
lib
reigned
in
his
stead

and
it
came
to
pass
that
lib
also
did
that
which
was
good
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
in
the
days
of

built
a
great
city
by

narrow
neck
of
land
by
the
place
where
the
sea
divides
the
land

and
they
did
preserve
the
land
southward
for
a
wilderness
to
get
game
and
the
whole
face
of
the
land
northward
was
covered
with
inhabitants

and
they
were
exceedingly
industrious
and
they
did
buy

they
might
get

and
they
did
work
in
all
manner
of

and
they
did
make
gold
and
silver
and
iron
and
brass
and
all
manner
of
metals
and
they
did
dig
it
out
of
the
earth
wherefore
they
did
cast
up
mighty
heaps
of
earth
to
get
ore
of
gold
and
of
silver
and
of
iron
and
of
copper
and
they
did
work

and
never
could
be
a
people
more
blessed
than
were
they
and
more
prospered
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
and
they
were
in
a
land
that
was
choice
above
all
lands
for
the
lord
had
spoken
it

and
it
came
to
pass
that

did
live
many
years
and
begat
sons
and
daughters
and
he
also
begat
hearthom

and
it
came
to
pass
that

father
and
when

reigned
twenty
and
four
years
behold
the

was
taken
away
from

and
he
served
many
years
in

yea
even
all
the
remainder
of
his

and
he
begat

heth
lived
in

and
heth
begat
aaron
and
aaron
dwelt
in

all
his
days
and
he
begat
coriantum
and
coriantum
dwelt
in

and
he
begat

drew
away
the
half
of

and
he
reigned
over
the
half
of
the
kingdom
forty
and
two
years
and
he
went
to
battle
against
the
king
amgid
and
they
fought
for
the
space
of
many
years
during
which
time
com
gained
power
over
amgid
and
obtained
power
over
the
remainder
of
the
kingdom

and
in
the
days
of
com
there
began
to
be
robbers
in
the
land
and
they
adopted
the
old
plans
and
administered
oaths
after
the
manner
of
the
ancients
and
sought
again
to
destroy
the
kingdom

now
com
did
fight
against
them
much
nevertheless
he
did
not
prevail
against
them
ether
chapter


and
there
came
also
in
the
days
of
com
many
prophets
and
prophesied
of
the
destruction
of
that
great
people
except
they
should
repent
and
turn
unto
the
lord
and
forsake
their
murders
and
wickedness

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
prophets
were
rejected
by
the
people
and
they
fled
unto
com
for
protection
for
the
people
sought
to
destroy
them

and
they
prophesied
unto
com
many
things
and
he
was
blessed
in
all
the
remainder
of
his
days

and
he
lived
to
a
good
old
age
and
begat
shiblom
and
shiblom
reigned
in
his
stead
and
the
brother
of
shiblom
rebelled
against
him
and
there
began
to
be
an
exceedingly
great
war
in
all
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
shiblom
caused
that
all
the
prophets
who
prophesied
of
the
destruction
of
the
people
should
be
put
to
death

and
there
was
great
calamity
in
all
the
land
for
they
had
testified
that
a
great
curse
should
come
upon
the
land
and
also
upon
the
people
and
that
there
should
be
a
great
destruction
among
them
such
an
one
as
never
had
been
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
their
bones
should
become
as
heaps
of
earth
upon
the
face
of
the
land
except
they
should
repent
of
their
wickedness

and
they
hearkened
not
unto
the
voice
of
the
lord
because
of
their
wicked
combinations
wherefore
there
began
to
be
wars
and
contentions
in
all
the
land
and
also
many
famines
and
pestilences
insomuch
that
there
was
a
great
destruction
such
an
one
as
never
had
been
known
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
all
this
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
shiblom

and
the
people
began
to
repent
of
their
iniquity
and
inasmuch
as
they
did
the
lord
did
have
mercy
on
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
shiblom
was
slain
and
seth
was
brought
into
captivity
and
did
dwell
in
captivity
all
his
days

and
it
came
to
pass
that
ahah
his
son
did
obtain
the
kingdom
and
he
did
reign
over
the
people
all
his
days
and
he
did
do
all
manner
of
iniquity
in
his
days
by
which
he
did
cause
the
shedding
of
much
blood
and
few
were
his
days

and
ethem
being
a
descendant
of
ahah
did
obtain
the
kingdom
and
he
also
did
do
that
which
was
wicked
in
his
days

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
days
of
ethem
there
came
many
prophets
and
prophesied
again
unto
the
people
yea
they
did
prophesy
that
the
lord
would
utterly
destroy
them
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
except
they
repented
of
their
iniquities

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
hardened
their
hearts
and
would
not
hearken
unto
their
words
and
the
prophets
mourned
and
withdrew
from
among
the
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
ethem
did
execute
judgment
in
wickedness
all
his
days
and
he
begat
moron
and
it
came
to
pass
that
moron
did
reign
in
his
stead
and
moron
did
that
which
was
wicked
before
the
lord

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
arose
a
rebellion
among
the
people
because
of
that
secret
combination
which
was
built
up
to
get
power
and
gain
and
there
arose
a
mighty
man
among
them
in
iniquity
and
gave
battle
unto
moron
in
which
he
did
overthrow
the
half
of
the
kingdom
and
he
did
maintain
the
half
of
the
kingdom
for
many
years

and
it
came
to
pass
that
moron
did
overthrow
him
and
did
obtain
the
kingdom
again

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
arose
another
mighty
man
and
he
was
a
descendant
of
the
brother
of
jared

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
overthrow
moron
and
obtain
the
kingdom
wherefore
moron
dwelt
in
captivity
all
the
remainder
of
his
days
and
he
begat
coriantor

and
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantor
dwelt
in
captivity
all
his
days

and
in
the
days
of
coriantor
there
also
came
many
prophets
and
prophesied
of
great
and
marvelous
things
and
cried
repentance
unto
the
people
and
except
they
should
repent
the
lord
god
would
execute
judgment
against
them
to
their
utter
destruction

and
that
the
lord
god
would
send
or
bring
forth
another
people
to
possess
the
land
by
his
power
after
the
manner
by
which
he
brought
their
fathers

and
they
did
reject
all
the
words
of
the
prophets
because
of
their
secret
society
and
wicked
abominations

and
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantor
begat
ether
and
he
died
having
dwelt
in
captivity
all
his
days
ether
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
days
of
ether
were
in
the
days
of
coriantumr
and
coriantumr
was
king
over
all
the
land

and
ether
was
a
prophet
of
the
lord
wherefore
ether
came
forth
in
the
days
of
coriantumr
and
began
to
prophesy
unto
the
people
for
he
could
not
be
restrained
because
of
the
spirit
of
the
lord
which
was
in
him

for
he
did
cry
from
the
morning
even
until
the
going
down
of
the
sun
exhorting
the
people
to
believe
in
god
unto
repentance
lest
they
should
be
destroyed
saying
unto
them
that
by
faith
all
things
are
fulfilled

wherefore
whoso
believeth
in
god
might
with
surety
hope
for
a
better
world
yea
even
a
place
at
the
right
hand
of
god
which
hope
cometh
of
faith
maketh
an
anchor
to
the
souls
of
men
which
would
make
them
sure
and
steadfast
always
abounding
in
good
works
being
led
to
glorify
god

and
it
came
to
pass
that
ether
did
prophesy
great
and
marvelous
things
unto
the
people
which
they
did
not
believe
because
they
saw
them
not

and
now
i
moroni
would
speak
somewhat
concerning
these
things
i
would
show
unto
the
world
that
faith
is
things
which
are
hoped
for
and
not
seen
wherefore
dispute
not
because
ye
see
not
for
ye
receive
no
witness
until
after
the
trial
of
your
faith

for
it
was
by
faith
that
christ
showed
himself
unto
our
fathers
after
he
had
risen
from
the
dead
and
he
showed
not
himself
unto
them
until
after
they
had
faith
in
him
wherefore
it
must
needs
be
that
some
had
faith
in
him
for
he
showed
himself
not
unto
the
world

but
because
of
the
faith
of
men
he
has
shown
himself
unto
the
world
and
glorified
the
name
of
the
father
and
prepared
a
way
that
thereby
others
might
be
partakers
of
the
heavenly
gift
that
they
might
hope
for
those
things
which
they
have
not
seen

wherefore
ye
may
also
have
hope
and
be
partakers
of
the
gift
if
ye
will
but
have
faith

behold
it
was
by
faith
that
they
of
old
were
called
after
the
holy
order
of
god

wherefore
by
faith
was
the
law
of
moses
given
but
in
the
gift
of
his
son
hath
god
prepared
a
more
excellent
way
and
it
is
by
faith
that
it
hath
been
fulfilled

for
if
there
be
no
faith
among
the
children
of
men
god
can
do
no
miracle
among
them
wherefore
he
showed
not
himself
until
after
their
faith

behold
it
was
the
faith
of
alma
and
amulek
that
caused
the
prison
to
tumble
to
the
earth

behold
it
was
the
faith
of
nephi
and
lehi
that
wrought
the
change
upon
the
lamanites
that
they
were
baptized
with
fire
and
with
the
holy
ghost

behold
it
was
the
faith
of
ammon
and
his
brethren
which
wrought
so
great
a
miracle
among
the
lamanites

yea
and
even
all
they
who
wrought
miracles
wrought
them
by
faith
even
those
who
were
before
christ
and
also
those
who
were
after

and
it
was
by
faith
that
the
three
disciples
obtained
a
promise
that
they
should
not
taste
of
death
and
they
obtained
not
the
promise
until
after
their
faith

and
neither
at
any
time
hath
any
wrought
miracles
until
after
their
faith
wherefore
they
first
believed
in
the
son
of
god

and
there
were
many
whose
faith
was
so
exceedingly
strong
even
before
christ
came
who
could
not
be
kept
from
within
the
veil
but
truly
saw
with
their
eyes
the
things
which
they
had
beheld
with
an
eye
of
faith
and
they
were
glad

and
behold
we
have
seen
in
this
record
that
one
of
these
was
the
brother
of
jared
for
so
great
was
his
faith
in
god
that
when
god
put
forth
his
finger
he
could
not
hide
it
from
the
sight
of
the
brother
of
jared
because
of
his
word
which
he
had
spoken
unto
him
which
word
he
had
obtained
by
faith

and
after
the
brother
of
jared
had
beheld
the
finger
of
the
lord
because
of
the
promise
which
the
brother
of
jared
had
obtained
by
faith
the
lord
could
not
withhold
anything
from
his
sight
wherefore
he
showed
him
all
things
for
he
could
no
longer
be
kept
without
the
veil

and
it
is
by
faith
that
my
fathers
have
obtained
the
promise
that
these
things
should
come
unto
their
brethren
through
the
gentiles
therefore
the
lord
hath
commanded
me
yea
even
jesus
christ

and
i
said
unto
him
lord
the
gentiles
will
mock
at
these
things
because
of
our
weakness
in
writing
for
lord
thou
hast
made
us
mighty
in
word
by
faith
but
thou
hast
not
made
us
mighty
in
writing
for
thou
hast
made
all
this
people
that
they
could
speak
much
because
of
the
holy
ghost
which
thou
hast
given
them

and
thou
hast
made
us
that
we
could
write
but
little
because
of
the
awkwardness
of
our
hands
behold
thou
hast
not
made
us
mighty
in
writing
like
unto
the
brother
of
jared
for
thou
madest
him
that
the
things
which
he
wrote
were
mighty
even
as
thou
art
unto
the
overpowering
of
man
to
read
them

thou
hast
also
made
our
words
powerful
and
great
even
that
we
cannot
write
them
wherefore
when
we
write
we
behold
our
weakness
and
stumble
because
of
the
placing
of
our
words
and
i
fear
lest
the
gentiles
shall
mock
at
our
words

and
when
i
had
said
this
the
lord
spake
unto
me
saying
fools
mock
but
they
shall
mourn
and
my
grace
is
sufficient
for
the
meek
that
they
shall
take
no
advantage
of
your
weakness

and
if
men
come
unto
me
i
will
show
unto
them
their
weakness
i
give
unto
men
weakness
that
they
may
be
humble
and
my
grace
is
sufficient
for
all
men
that
humble
themselves
before
me
for
if
they
humble
themselves
before
me
and
have
faith
in
me
then
will
i
make
weak
things
become
strong
unto
them

behold
i
will
show
unto
the
gentiles
their
weakness
and
i
will
show
unto
them
that
faith
hope
and
charity
bringeth
unto
methe
fountain
of
all
righteousness

and
i
moroni
having
heard
these
words
was
comforted
and
said
o
lord
thy
righteous
will
be
done
for
i
know
that
thou
workest
unto
the
children
of
men
according
to
their
faith

for
the
brother
of
jared
said
unto
the
mountain
zerin
removeand
it
was
removed
and
if
he
had
not
had
faith
it
would
not
have
moved
wherefore
thou
workest
after
men
have
faith

for
thus
didst
thou
manifest
thyself
unto
thy
disciples
for
after
they
had
faith
and
did
speak
in
thy
name
thou
didst
show
thyself
unto
them
in
great
power

and
i
also
remember
that
thou
hast
said
that
thou
hast
prepared
a
house
for
man
yea
even
among
the
mansions
of
thy
father
in
which
man
might
have
a
more
excellent
hope
wherefore
man
must
hope
or
he
cannot
receive
an
inheritance
in
the
place
which
thou
hast
prepared

and
again
i
remember
that
thou
hast
said
that
thou
hast
loved
the
world
even
unto
the
laying
down
of
thy
life
for
the
world
that
thou
mightest
take
it
again
to
prepare
a
place
for
the
children
of
men

and
now
i
know
that
this
love
which
thou
hast
had
for
the
children
of
men
is
charity
wherefore
except
men
shall
have
charity
they
cannot
inherit
that
place
which
thou
hast
prepared
in
the
mansions
of
thy
father

wherefore
i
know
by
this
thing
which
thou
hast
said
that
if
the
gentiles
have
not
charity
because
of
our
weakness
that
thou
wilt
prove
them
and
take
away
their
talent
yea
even
that
which
they
have
received
and
give
unto
them
who
shall
have
more
abundantly

and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
prayed
unto
the
lord
that
he
would
give
unto
the
gentiles
grace
that
they
might
have
charity

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
said
unto
me
if
they
have
not
charity
it
mattereth
not
unto
thee
thou
hast
been
faithful
wherefore
thy
garments
shall
be
made
clean
and
because
thou
hast
seen
thy
weakness
thou
shalt
be
made
strong
even
unto
the
sitting
down
in
the
place
which
i
have
prepared
in
the
mansions
of
my
father

and
now
i
moroni
bid
farewell
unto
the
gentiles
yea
and
also
unto
my
brethren
whom
i
love
until
we
shall
meet
before
the
judgmentseat
of
christ
where
all
men
shall
know
that
my
garments
are
not
spotted
with
your
blood

and
then
shall
ye
know
that
i
have
seen
jesus
and
that
he
hath
talked
with
me
face
to
face
and
that
he
told
me
in
plain
humility
even
as
a
man
telleth
another
in
mine
own
language
concerning
these
things

and
only
a
few
have
i
written
because
of
my
weakness
in
writing

and
now
i
would
commend
you
to
seek
this
jesus
of
whom
the
prophets
and
apostles
have
written
that
the
grace
of
god
the
father
and
also
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
the
holy
ghost
which
beareth
record
of
them
may
be
and
abide
in
you
forever
amen
ether
chapter


and
now
i
moroni
proceed
to
finish
my
record
concerning
the
destruction
of
the
people
of
whom
i
have
been
writing

for
behold
they
rejected
all
the
words
of
ether
for
he
truly
told
them
of
all
things
from
the
beginning
of
man
and
that
after
the
waters
had
receded
from
off
the
face
of
this
land
it
became
a
choice
land
above
all
other
lands
a
chosen
land
of
the
lord
wherefore
the
lord
would
have
that
all
men
should
serve
him
who
dwell
upon
the
face
thereof

and
that
it
was
the
place
of
the
new
jerusalem
which
should
come
down
out
of
heaven
and
the
holy
sanctuary
of
the
lord

behold
ether
saw
the
days
of
christ
and
he
spake
concerning
a
new
jerusalem
upon
this
land

and
he
spake
also
concerning
the
house
of
israel
and
the
jerusalem
from
whence
lehi
should
comeafter
it
should
be
destroyed
it
should
be
built
up
again
a
holy
city
unto
the
lord
wherefore
it
could
not
be
a
new
jerusalem
for
it
had
been
in
a
time
of
old
but
it
should
be
built
up
again
and
become
a
holy
city
of
the
lord
and
it
should
be
built
unto
the
house
of
israel

and
that
a
new
jerusalem
should
be
built
upon
this
land
unto
the
remnant
of
the
seed
of
joseph
for
which
things
there
has
been
a
type

for
as
joseph
brought
his
father
down
into
the
land
of
egypt
even
so
he
died
there
wherefore
the
lord
brought
a
remnant
of
the
seed
of
joseph
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
that
he
might
be
merciful
unto
the
seed
of
joseph
that
they
should
perish
not
even
as
he
was
merciful
unto
the
father
of
joseph
that
he
should
perish
not

wherefore
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
joseph
shall
be
built
upon
this
land
and
it
shall
be
a
land
of
their
inheritance
and
they
shall
build
up
a
holy
city
unto
the
lord
like
unto
the
jerusalem
of
old
and
they
shall
no
more
be
confounded
until
the
end
come
when
the
earth
shall
pass
away

and
there
shall
be
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
and
they
shall
be
like
unto
the
old
save
the
old
have
passed
away
and
all
things
have
become
new

and
then
cometh
the
new
jerusalem
and
blessed
are
they
who
dwell
therein
for
it
is
they
whose
garments
are
white
through
the
blood
of
the
lamb
and
they
are
they
who
are
numbered
among
the
remnant
of
the
seed
of
joseph
who
were
of
the
house
of
israel

and
then
also
cometh
the
jerusalem
of
old
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
blessed
are
they
for
they
have
been
washed
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
and
they
are
they
who
were
scattered
and
gathered
in
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
and
from
the
north
countries
and
are
partakers
of
the
fulfilling
of
the
covenant
which
god
made
with
their
father
abraham

and
when
these
things
come
bringeth
to
pass
the
scripture
which
saith
there
are
they
who
were
first
who
shall
be
last
and
there
are
they
who
were
last
who
shall
be
first

and
i
was
about
to
write
more
but
i
am
forbidden
but
great
and
marvelous
were
the
prophecies
of
ether
but
they
esteemed
him
as
naught
and
cast
him
out
and
he
hid
himself
in
the
cavity
of
a
rock
by
day
and
by
night
he
went
forth
viewing
the
things
which
should
come
upon
the
people

and
as
he
dwelt
in
the
cavity
of
a
rock
he
made
the
remainder
of
his
record
viewing
the
destructions
which
came
upon
the
people
by
night

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
that
same
year
in
which
he
was
cast
out
from
among
the
people
there
began
to
be
a
great
war
among
the
people
for
there
were
many
who
rose
up
who
were
mighty
men
and
sought
to
destroy
coriantumr
by
their
secret
plans
of
wickedness
of
which
hath
been
spoken

and
now
coriantumr
having
studied
himself
in
all
the
arts
of
war
and
all
the
cunning
of
the
world
wherefore
he
gave
battle
unto
them
who
sought
to
destroy
him

but
he
repented
not
neither
his
fair
sons
nor
daughters
neither
the
fair
sons
and
daughters
of
cohor
neither
the
fair
sons
and
daughters
of
corihor
and
in
fine
there
were
none
of
the
fair
sons
and
daughters
upon
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
who
repented
of
their
sins

wherefore
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
first
year
that
ether
dwelt
in
the
cavity
of
a
rock
there
were
many
people
who
were
slain
by
the
sword
of
those
secret
combinations
fighting
against
coriantumr
that
they
might
obtain
the
kingdom

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
sons
of
coriantumr
fought
much
and
bled
much

and
in
the
second
year
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
ether
that
he
should
go
and
prophesy
unto
coriantumr
that
if
he
would
repent
and
all
his
household
the
lord
would
give
unto
him
his
kingdom
and
spare
the
people

otherwise
they
should
be
destroyed
and
all
his
household
save
it
were
himself
and
he
should
only
live
to
see
the
fulfilling
of
the
prophecies
which
had
been
spoken
concerning
another
people
receiving
the
land
for
their
inheritance
and
coriantumr
should
receive
a
burial
by
them
and
every
soul
should
be
destroyed
save
it
were
coriantumr

and
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantumr
repented
not
neither
his
household
neither
the
people
and
the
wars
ceased
not
and
they
sought
to
kill
ether
but
he
fled
from
before
them
and
hid
again
in
the
cavity
of
the
rock

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
arose
up
shared
and
he
also
gave
battle
unto
coriantumr
and
he
did
beat
him
insomuch
that
in
the
third
year
he
did
bring
him
into
captivity

and
the
sons
of
coriantumr
in
the
fourth
year
did
beat
shared
and
did
obtain
the
kingdom
again
unto
their
father

now
there
began
to
be
a
war
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
every
man
with
his
band
fighting
for
that
which
he
desired

and
there
were
robbers
and
in
fine
all
manner
of
wickedness
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantumr
was
exceedingly
angry
with
shared
and
he
went
against
him
with
his
armies
to
battle
and
they
did
meet
in
great
anger
and
they
did
meet
in
the
valley
of
gilgal
and
the
battle
became
exceedingly
sore

and
it
came
to
pass
that
shared
fought
against
him
for
the
space
of
three
days
and
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantumr
beat
him
and
did
pursue
him
until
he
came
to
the
plains
of
heshlon

and
it
came
to
pass
that
shared
gave
him
battle
again
upon
the
plains
and
behold
he
did
beat
coriantumr
and
drove
him
back
again
to
the
valley
of
gilgal

and
coriantumr
gave
shared
battle
again
in
the
valley
of
gilgal
in
which
he
beat
shared
and
slew
him

and
shared
wounded
coriantumr
in
his
thigh
that
he
did
not
go
to
battle
again
for
the
space
of
two
years
in
which
time
all
the
people
upon
the
face
of
the
land
were
shedding
blood
and
there
was
none
to
restrain
them
ether
chapter


and
now
there
began
to
be
a
great
curse
upon
all
the
land
because
of
the
iniquity
of
the
people
in
which
if
a
man
should
lay
his
tool
or
his
sword
upon
his
shelf
or
upon
the
place
whither
he
would
keep
it
behold
upon
the
morrow
he
could
not
find
it
so
great
was
the
curse
upon
the
land

wherefore
every
man
did
cleave
unto
that
which
was
his
own
with
his
hands
and
would
not
borrow
neither
would
he
lend
and
every
man
kept
the
hilt
of
his
sword
in
his
right
hand
in
the
defence
of
his
property
and
his
own
life
and
of
his
wives
and
children

and
now
after
the
space
of
two
years
and
after
the
death
of
shared
behold
there
arose
the
brother
of
shared
and
he
gave
battle
unto
coriantumr
in
which
coriantumr
did
beat
him
and
did
pursue
him
to
the
wilderness
of
akish

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
shared
did
give
battle
unto
him
in
the
wilderness
of
akish
and
the
battle
became
exceedingly
sore
and
many
thousands
fell
by
the
sword

and
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantumr
did
lay
siege
to
the
wilderness
and
the
brother
of
shared
did
march
forth
out
of
the
wilderness
by
night
and
slew
a
part
of
the
army
of
coriantumr
as
they
were
drunken

and
he
came
forth
to
the
land
of
moron
and
placed
himself
upon
the
throne
of
coriantumr

and
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantumr
dwelt
with
his
army
in
the
wilderness
for
the
space
of
two
years
in
which
he
did
receive
great
strength
to
his
army

now
the
brother
of
shared
whose
name
was
gilead
also
received
great
strength
to
his
army
because
of
secret
combinations

and
it
came
to
pass
that
his
high
priest
murdered
him
as
he
sat
upon
his
throne

and
it
came
to
pass
that
one
of
the
secret
combinations
murdered
him
in
a
secret
pass
and
obtained
unto
himself
the
kingdom
and
his
name
was
lib
and
lib
was
a
man
of
great
stature
more
than
any
other
man
among
all
the
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
first
year
of
lib
coriantumr
came
up
unto
the
land
of
moron
and
gave
battle
unto
lib

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
fought
with
lib
in
which
lib
did
smite
upon
his
arm
that
he
was
wounded
nevertheless
the
army
of
coriantumr
did
press
forward
upon
lib
that
he
fled
to
the
borders
upon
the
seashore

and
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantumr
pursued
him
and
lib
gave
battle
unto
him
upon
the
seashore

and
it
came
to
pass
that
lib
did
smite
the
army
of
coriantumr
that
they
fled
again
to
the
wilderness
of
akish

and
it
came
to
pass
that
lib
did
pursue
him
until
he
came
to
the
plains
of
agosh
and
coriantumr
had
taken
all
the
people
with
him
as
he
fled
before
lib
in
that
quarter
of
the
land
whither
he
fled

and
when
he
had
come
to
the
plains
of
agosh
he
gave
battle
unto
lib
and
he
smote
upon
him
until
he
died
nevertheless
the
brother
of
lib
did
come
against
coriantumr
in
the
stead
thereof
and
the
battle
became
exceedingly
sore
in
the
which
coriantumr
fled
again
before
the
army
of
the
brother
of
lib

now
the
name
of
the
brother
of
lib
was
called
shiz
and
it
came
to
pass
that
shiz
pursued
after
coriantumr
and
he
did
overthrow
many
cities
and
he
did
slay
both
women
and
children
and
he
did
burn
the
cities

and
there
went
a
fear
of
shiz
throughout
all
the
land
yea
a
cry
went
forth
throughout
the
landwho
can
stand
before
the
army
of
shiz
behold
he
sweepeth
the
earth
before
him

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
began
to
flock
together
in
armies
throughout
all
the
face
of
the
land

and
they
were
divided
and
a
part
of
them
fled
to
the
army
of
shiz
and
a
part
of
them
fled
to
the
army
of
coriantumr

and
so
great
and
lasting
had
been
the
war
and
so
long
had
been
the
scene
of
bloodshed
and
carnage
that
the
whole
face
of
the
land
was
covered
with
the
bodies
of
the
dead

and
so
swift
and
speedy
was
the
war
that
there
was
none
left
to
bury
the
dead
but
they
did
march
forth
from
the
shedding
of
blood
to
the
shedding
of
blood
leaving
the
bodies
of
both
men
women
and
children
strewed
upon
the
face
of
the
land
to
become
a
prey
to
the
worms
of
the
flesh

and
the
scent
thereof
went
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
land
even
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
wherefore
the
people
became
troubled
by
day
and
by
night
because
of
the
scent
thereof

nevertheless
shiz
did
not
cease
to
pursue
coriantumr
for
he
had
sworn
to
avenge
himself
upon
coriantumr
of
the
blood
of
his
brother
who
had
been
slain
and
the
word
of
the
lord
which
came
to
ether
that
coriantumr
should
not
fall
by
the
sword

and
thus
we
see
that
the
lord
did
visit
them
in
the
fulness
of
his
wrath
and
their
wickedness
and
abominations
had
prepared
a
way
for
their
everlasting
destruction

and
it
came
to
pass
that
shiz
did
pursue
coriantumr
eastward
even
to
the
borders
by
the
seashore
and
there
he
gave
battle
unto
shiz
for
the
space
of
three
days

and
so
terrible
was
the
destruction
among
the
armies
of
shiz
that
the
people
began
to
be
frightened
and
began
to
flee
before
the
armies
of
coriantumr
and
they
fled
to
the
land
of
corihor
and
swept
off
the
inhabitants
before
them
all
them
that
would
not
join
them

and
they
pitched
their
tents
in
the
valley
of
corihor
and
coriantumr
pitched
his
tents
in
the
valley
of
shurr
now
the
valley
of
shurr
was
near
the
hill
comnor
wherefore
coriantumr
did
gather
his
armies
together
upon
the
hill
comnor
and
did
sound
a
trumpet
unto
the
armies
of
shiz
to
invite
them
forth
to
battle

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
came
forth
but
were
driven
again
and
they
came
the
second
time
and
they
were
driven
again
the
second
time
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
came
again
the
third
time
and
the
battle
became
exceedingly
sore

and
it
came
to
pass
that
shiz
smote
upon
coriantumr
that
he
gave
him
many
deep
wounds
and
coriantumr
having
lost
his
blood
fainted
and
was
carried
away
as
though
he
were
dead

now
the
loss
of
men
women
and
children
on
both
sides
was
so
great
that
shiz
commanded
his
people
that
they
should
not
pursue
the
armies
of
coriantumr
wherefore
they
returned
to
their
camp
ether
chapter


and
it
came
to
pass
when
coriantumr
had
recovered
of
his
wounds
he
began
to
remember
the
words
which
ether
had
spoken
unto
him

he
saw
that
there
had
been
slain
by
the
sword
already
nearly
two
millions
of
his
people
and
he
began
to
sorrow
in
his
heart
yea
there
had
been
slain
two
millions
of
mighty
men
and
also
their
wives
and
their
children

he
began
to
repent
of
the
evil
which
he
had
done
he
began
to
remember
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
all
the
prophets
and
he
saw
them
that
they
were
fulfilled
thus
far
every
whit
and
his
soul
mourned
and
refused
to
be
comforted

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
wrote
an
epistle
unto
shiz
desiring
him
that
he
would
spare
the
people
and
he
would
give
up
the
kingdom
for
the
sake
of
the
lives
of
the
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
shiz
had
received
his
epistle
he
wrote
an
epistle
unto
coriantumr
that
if
he
would
give
himself
up
that
he
might
slay
him
with
his
own
sword
that
he
would
spare
the
lives
of
the
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
repented
not
of
their
iniquity
and
the
people
of
coriantumr
were
stirred
up
to
anger
against
the
people
of
shiz
and
the
people
of
shiz
were
stirred
up
to
anger
against
the
people
of
coriantumr
wherefore
the
people
of
shiz
did
give
battle
unto
the
people
of
coriantumr

and
when
coriantumr
saw
that
he
was
about
to
fall
he
fled
again
before
the
people
of
shiz

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
came
to
the
waters
of
ripliancum
which
by
interpretation
is
large
or
to
exceed
all
wherefore
when
they
came
to
these
waters
they
pitched
their
tents
and
shiz
also
pitched
his
tents
near
unto
them
and
therefore
on
the
morrow
they
did
come
to
battle

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
fought
an
exceedingly
sore
battle
in
which
coriantumr
was
wounded
again
and
he
fainted
with
the
loss
of
blood

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
of
coriantumr
did
press
upon
the
armies
of
shiz
that
they
beat
them
that
they
caused
them
to
flee
before
them
and
they
did
flee
southward
and
did
pitch
their
tents
in
a
place
which
was
called
ogath

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
army
of
coriantumr
did
pitch
their
tents
by
the
hill
ramah
and
it
was
that
same
hill
where
my
father
mormon
did
hide
up
the
records
unto
the
lord
which
were
sacred

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
gather
together
all
the
people
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
who
had
not
been
slain
save
it
was
ether

and
it
came
to
pass
that
ether
did
behold
all
the
doings
of
the
people
and
he
beheld
that
the
people
who
were
for
coriantumr
were
gathered
together
to
the
army
of
coriantumr
and
the
people
who
were
for
shiz
were
gathered
together
to
the
army
of
shiz

wherefore
they
were
for
the
space
of
four
years
gathering
together
the
people
that
they
might
get
all
who
were
upon
the
face
of
the
land
and
that
they
might
receive
all
the
strength
which
it
was
possible
that
they
could
receive

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
were
all
gathered
together
every
one
to
the
army
which
he
would
with
their
wives
and
their
childrenboth
men
women
and
children
being
armed
with
weapons
of
war
having
shields
and
breastplates
and
headplates
and
being
clothed
after
the
manner
of
warthey
did
march
forth
one
against
another
to
battle
and
they
fought
all
that
day
and
conquered
not

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
it
was
night
they
were
weary
and
retired
to
their
camps
and
after
they
had
retired
to
their
camps
they
took
up
a
howling
and
a
lamentation
for
the
loss
of
the
slain
of
their
people
and
so
great
were
their
cries
their
howlings
and
lamentations
that
they
did
rend
the
air
exceedingly

and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
they
did
go
again
to
battle
and
great
and
terrible
was
that
day
nevertheless
they
conquered
not
and
when
the
night
came
again
they
did
rend
the
air
with
their
cries
and
their
howlings
and
their
mournings
for
the
loss
of
the
slain
of
their
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantumr
wrote
again
an
epistle
unto
shiz
desiring
that
he
would
not
come
again
to
battle
but
that
he
would
take
the
kingdom
and
spare
the
lives
of
the
people

and
behold
the
spirit
of
the
lord
had
ceased
striving
with
them
and
satan
had
full
power
over
the
hearts
of
the
people
for
they
were
given
up
unto
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
the
blindness
of
their
minds
that
they
might
be
destroyed
wherefore
they
went
again
to
battle

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
fought
all
that
day
and
when
the
night
came
they
slept
upon
their
swords

and
on
the
morrow
they
fought
even
until
the
night
came

and
when
the
night
came
they
were
drunken
with
anger
even
as
a
man
who
is
drunken
with
wine
and
they
slept
again
upon
their
swords

and
on
the
morrow
they
fought
again
and
when
the
night
came
they
had
all
fallen
by
the
sword
save
it
were
fifty
and
two
of
the
people
of
coriantumr
and
sixty
and
nine
of
the
people
of
shiz

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
slept
upon
their
swords
that
night
and
on
the
morrow
they
fought
again
and
they
contended
in
their
might
with
their
swords
and
with
their
shields
all
that
day

and
when
the
night
came
there
were
thirty
and
two
of
the
people
of
shiz
and
twenty
and
seven
of
the
people
of
coriantumr

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
ate
and
slept
and
prepared
for
death
on
the
morrow
and
they
were
large
and
mighty
men
as
to
the
strength
of
men

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
fought
for
the
space
of
three
hours
and
they
fainted
with
the
loss
of
blood

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
men
of
coriantumr
had
received
sufficient
strength
that
they
could
walk
they
were
about
to
flee
for
their
lives
but
behold
shiz
arose
and
also
his
men
and
he
swore
in
his
wrath
that
he
would
slay
coriantumr
or
he
would
perish
by
the
sword

wherefore
he
did
pursue
them
and
on
the
morrow
he
did
overtake
them
and
they
fought
again
with
the
sword
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
all
fallen
by
the
sword
save
it
were
coriantumr
and
shiz
behold
shiz
had
fainted
with
the
loss
of
blood

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
coriantumr
had
leaned
upon
his
sword
that
he
rested
a
little
he
smote
off
the
head
of
shiz

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
he
had
smitten
off
the
head
of
shiz
that
shiz
raised
upon
his
hands
and
fell
and
after
that
he
had
struggled
for
breath
he
died

and
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantumr
fell
to
the
earth
and
became
as
if
he
had
no
life

and
the
lord
spake
unto
ether
and
said
unto
him
go
forth
and
he
went
forth
and
beheld
that
the
words
of
the
lord
had
all
been
fulfilled
and
he
finished
his
record
and
the
hundredth
part
i
have
not
written
and
he
hid
them
in
a
manner
that
the
people
of
limhi
did
find
them

now
the
last
words
which
are
written
by
ether
are
these
whether
the
lord
will
that
i
be
translated
or
that
i
suffer
the
will
of
the
lord
in
the
flesh

if
it
so

that

i

after

made
an
end
of
abridging
the
account
of
the

i
had
supposed
not

but
i
have
not

yet
perished
and
i
make
not
myself
known
to
the
lamanites
lest
they
should
destroy
me

for
behold
their
wars
are
exceedingly
fierce
among
themselves

because
of
their
hatred
they
put
to
death
every
nephite
that
will
not

not

i
write
a

contrary

i
had
supposed
not

i
write
a

the

he
spake
unto

the

whom
he
had
chosen
as
he
laid

and
he
called
them

spake

unto

at
the
time
of
his

appearing
and
the

and
now
i
speak
concerning
baptism
behold
elders
priests
and
teachers
were
baptized
and
they
were
not
baptized
save
they
brought
forth
fruit
meet
that
they
were
worthy
of
it

neither
did
they
receive
any
unto
baptism
save
they
came
forth
with
a
broken
heart
and
a
contrite
spirit
and
witnessed
unto
the
church
that
they
truly
repented
of
all
their
sins

and
none
were
received
unto
baptism
save
they
took
upon
them
the
name
of
christ
having
a
determination
to
serve
him
to
the
end

and
after
they
had
been
received
unto
baptism
and
were
wrought
upon
and
cleansed
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
they
were
numbered
among
the
people
of
the
church

their
names
were
taken
that
they
might
be
remembered
and
nourished
by
the
good
word
of

to
keep
them
in
the
right
way
to
keep
them
continually
watchful
unto

relying
alone
upon

merits
of
christ
who
was
the
author
and
the
finisher
of
their
faith

and
the
church
did
meet
together
oft
to
fast
and
to
pray
and
to
speak
one
with
another
concerning
the
welfare
of
their
souls

and
they
did
meet
together
oft
to
partake
of
bread
and
wine
in
remembrance
of
the
lord
jesus

and
they
were
strict
to
observe
that
there
should
be
no
iniquity
among
them
and
whoso
was
found
to
commit
iniquity
and
three
witnesses
of
the
church
did
condemn
them
before
the
elders
and
if
they
repented
not
and
confessed
not
their
names
were
blotted
out
and
they
were
not
numbered
among
the
people
of
christ

but
as
oft
as
they
repented
and
sought
forgiveness
with
real
intent
they
were
forgiven

and
their
meetings
were
conducted
by
the
church
after
the
manner
of
the
workings
of
the
spirit
and
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
for
as
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
led
them
whether
to
preach
or
to
exhort
or
to
pray
or
to
supplicate
or
to
sing
even
so
it
was
done
moroni
chapter


and
now
i
moroni
write
a
few
of
the
words
of
my
father
mormon
which
he
spake
concerning
faith
hope
and
charity
for
after
this
manner
did
he
speak
unto
the
people
as
he
taught
them
in
the
synagogue
which
they
had
built
for
the
place
of
worship

and
now
i
mormon
speak
unto
you
my
beloved
brethren
and
it
is
by
the
grace
of
god
the
father
and
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
his
holy
will
because
of
the
gift
of
his
calling
unto
me
that
i
am
permitted
to
speak
unto
you
at
this
time

wherefore
i
would
speak
unto
you
that
are
of
the
church
that
are
the
peaceable
followers
of
christ
and
that
have
obtained
a
sufficient
hope
by
which
ye
can
enter
into
the
rest
of
the
lord
from
this
time
henceforth
until
ye
shall
rest
with
him
in
heaven

and
now
my
brethren
i
judge
these
things
of
you
because
of
your
peaceable
walk
with
the
children
of
men

for
i
remember
the
word
of
god
which
saith
by
their
works
ye
shall
know
them
for
if
their
works
be
good
then
they
are
good
also

for
behold
god
hath
said
a
man
being
evil
cannot
do
that
which
is
good
for
if
he
offereth
a
gift
or
prayeth
unto
god
except
he
shall
do
it
with
real
intent
it
profiteth
him
nothing

for
behold
it
is
not
counted
unto
him
for
righteousness

for
behold
if
a
man
being
evil
giveth
a
gift
he
doeth
it
grudgingly
wherefore
it
is
counted
unto
him
the
same
as
if
he
had
retained
the
gift
wherefore
he
is
counted
evil
before
god

and
likewise
also
is
it
counted
evil
unto
a
man
if
he
shall
pray
and
not
with
real
intent
of
heart
yea
and
it
profiteth
him
nothing
for
god
receiveth
none
such

wherefore
a
man
being
evil
cannot
do
that
which
is
good
neither
will
he
give
a
good
gift

for
behold
a
bitter
fountain
cannot
bring
forth
good
water
neither
can
a
good
fountain
bring
forth
bitter
water
wherefore
a
man
being
a
servant
of
the
devil
cannot
follow
christ
and
if
he
follow
christ
he
cannot
be
a
servant
of
the
devil

wherefore
all
things
which
are
good
cometh
of
god
and
that
which
is
evil
cometh
of
the
devil
for
the
devil
is
an
enemy
unto
god
and
fighteth
against
him
continually
and
inviteth
and
enticeth
to
sin
and
to
do
that
which
is
evil
continually

but
behold
that
which
is
of
god
inviteth
and
enticeth
to
do
good
continually
wherefore
every
thing
which
inviteth
and
enticeth
to
do
good
and
to
love
god
and
to
serve
him
is
inspired
of
god

wherefore
take
heed
my
beloved
brethren
that
ye
do
not
judge
that
which
is
evil
to
be
of
god
or
that
which
is
good
and
of
god
to
be
of
the
devil

for
behold
my
brethren
it
is
given
unto
you
to
judge
that
ye
may
know
good
from
evil
and
the
way
to
judge
is
as
plain
that
ye
may
know
with
a
perfect
knowledge
as
the
daylight
is
from
the
dark
night

for
behold
the
spirit
of
christ
is
given
to
every
man
that
he
may
know
good
from
evil
wherefore
i
show
unto
you
the
way
to
judge
for
every
thing
which
inviteth
to
do
good
and
to
persuade
to
believe
in
christ
is
sent
forth
by
the
power
and
gift
of
christ
wherefore
ye
may
know
with
a
perfect
knowledge
it
is
of
god

but
whatsoever
thing
persuadeth
men
to
do
evil
and
believe
not
in
christ
and
deny
him
and
serve
not
god
then
ye
may
know
with
a
perfect
knowledge
it
is
of
the
devil
for
after
this
manner
doth
the
devil
work
for
he
persuadeth
no
man
to
do
good
no
not
one
neither
do
his
angels
neither
do
they
who
subject
themselves
unto
him

and
now
my
brethren
seeing
that
ye
know
the
light
by
which
ye
may
judge
which
light
is
the
light
of
christ
see
that
ye
do
not
judge
wrongfully
for
with
that
same
judgment
which
ye
judge
ye
shall
also
be
judged

wherefore
i
beseech
of
you
brethren
that
ye
should
search
diligently
in
the
light
of
christ
that
ye
may
know
good
from
evil
and
if
ye
will
lay
hold
upon
every
good
thing
and
condemn
it
not
ye
certainly
will
be
a
child
of
christ

and
now
my
brethren
how
is
it
possible
that
ye
can
lay
hold
upon
every
good
thing

and
now
i
come
to
that
faith
of
which
i
said
i
would
speak
and
i
will
tell
you
the
way
whereby
ye
may
lay
hold
on
every
good
thing

for
behold
god
knowing
all
things
being
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
behold
he
sent
angels
to
minister
unto
the
children
of
men
to
make
manifest
concerning
the
coming
of
christ
and
in
christ
there
should
come
every
good
thing

and
god
also
declared
unto
prophets
by
his
own
mouth
that
christ
should
come

and
behold
there
were
divers
ways
that
he
did
manifest
things
unto
the
children
of
men
which
were
good
and
all
things
which
are
good
cometh
of
christ
otherwise
men
were
fallen
and
there
could
no
good
thing
come
unto
them

wherefore
by
the
ministering
of
angels
and
by
every
word
which
proceeded
forth
out
of
the
mouth
of
god
men
began
to
exercise
faith
in
christ
and
thus
by
faith
they
did
lay
hold
upon
every
good
thing
and
thus
it
was
until
the
coming
of
christ

and
after
that
he
came
men
also
were
saved
by
faith
in
his
name
and
by
faith
they
become
the
sons
of
god
and
as
sure
as
christ
liveth
he
spake
these
words
unto
our
fathers
saying
whatsoever
thing
ye
shall
ask
the
father
in
my
name
which
is
good
in
faith
believing
that
ye
shall
receive
behold
it
shall
be
done
unto
you

wherefore
my
beloved
brethren
have
miracles
ceased
because
christ
hath
ascended
into
heaven
and
hath
sat
down
on
the
right
hand
of
god
to
claim
of
the
father
his
rights
of
mercy
which
he
hath
upon
the
children
of
men

for
he
hath
answered
the
ends
of
the
law
and
he
claimeth
all
those
who
have
faith
in
him
and
they
who
have
faith
in
him
will
cleave
unto
every
good
thing
wherefore
he
advocateth
the
cause
of
the
children
of
men
and
he
dwelleth
eternally
in
the
heavens

and
because
he
hath
done
this
my
beloved
brethren
have
miracles
ceased
behold
i
say
unto
you
nay
neither
have
angels
ceased
to
minister
unto
the
children
of
men

for
behold
they
are
subject
unto
him
to
minister
according
to
the
word
of
his
command
showing
themselves
unto
them
of
strong
faith
and
a
firm
mind
in
every
form
of
godliness

and
the
office
of
their
ministry
is
to
call
men
unto
repentance
and
to
fulfill
and
to
do
the
work
of
the
covenants
of
the
father
which
he
hath
made
unto
the
children
of
men
to
prepare
the
way
among
the
children
of
men
by
declaring
the
word
of
christ
unto
the
chosen
vessels
of
the
lord
that
they
may
bear
testimony
of
him

and
by
so
doing
the
lord
god
prepareth
the
way
that
the
residue
of
men
may
have
faith
in
christ
that
the
holy
ghost
may
have
place
in
their
hearts
according
to
the
power
thereof
and
after
this
manner
bringeth
to
pass
the
father
the
covenants
which
he
hath
made
unto
the
children
of
men

and
christ
hath
said
if
ye
will
have
faith
in
me
ye
shall
have
power
to
do
whatsoever
thing
is
expedient
in
me

and
he
hath
said
repent
all
ye
ends
of
the
earth
and
come
unto
me
and
be
baptized
in
my
name
and
have
faith
in
me
that
ye
may
be
saved

and
now
my
beloved
brethren
if
this
be
the
case
that
these
things
are
true
which
i
have
spoken
unto
you
and
god
will
show
unto
you
with
power
and
great
glory
at
the
last
day
that
they
are
true
and
if
they
are
true
has
the
day
of
miracles
ceased

or
have
angels
ceased
to
appear
unto
the
children
of
men
or
has
he
withheld
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
from
them
or
will
he
so
long
as
time
shall
last
or
the
earth
shall
stand
or
there
shall
be
one
man
upon
the
face
thereof
to
be
saved

behold
i
say
unto
you
nay
for
it
is
by
faith
that
miracles
are
wrought
and
it
is
by
faith
that
angels
appear
and
minister
unto
men
wherefore
if
these
things
have
ceased
wo
be
unto
the
children
of
men
for
it
is
because
of
unbelief
and
all
is
vain

for
no
man
can
be
saved
according
to
the
words
of
christ
save
they
shall
have
faith
in
his
name
wherefore
if
these
things
have
ceased
then
has
faith
ceased
also
and
awful
is
the
state
of
man
for
they
are
as
though
there
had
been
no
redemption
made

but
behold
my
beloved
brethren
i
judge
better
things
of
you
for
i
judge
that
ye
have
faith
in
christ
because
of
your
meekness
for
if
ye
have
not
faith
in
him
then
ye
are
not
fit
to
be
numbered
among
the
people
of
his
church

and
again
my
beloved
brethren
i
would
speak
unto
you
concerning
hope
how
is
it
that
ye
can
attain
unto
faith
save
ye
shall
have
hope

and
what
is
it
that
ye
shall
hope
for
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
ye
shall
have
hope
through
the
atonement
of
christ
and
the
power
of
his
resurrection
to
be
raised
unto
life
eternal
and
this
because
of
your
faith
in
him
according
to
the
promise

wherefore
if
a
man
have
faith
he
must
needs
have
hope
for
without
faith
there
cannot
be
any
hope

and
again
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
he
cannot
have
faith
and
hope
save
he
shall
be
meek
and
lowly
of
heart

if
so
his
faith
and
hope
is
vain
for
none
is
acceptable
before
god
save
the
meek
and
lowly
in
heart
and
if
a
man
be
meek
and
lowly
in
heart
and
confesses
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
that
jesus
is
the
christ
he
must
needs
have
charity
for
if
he
have
not
charity
he
is
nothing
wherefore
he
must
needs
have
charity

and
charity
suffereth
long
and
is
kind
and
envieth
not
and
is
not
puffed
up
seeketh
not
her
own
is
not
easily
provoked
thinketh
no
evil
and
rejoiceth
not
in
iniquity
but
rejoiceth
in
the
truth
beareth
all
things
believeth
all
things
hopeth
all
things
endureth
all
things

wherefore
my
beloved
brethren
if
ye
have
not
charity
ye
are
nothing
for
charity
never
faileth
wherefore
cleave
unto
charity
which
is
the
greatest
of
all
for
all
things
must
fail

but
charity
is
the
pure
love
of
christ
and
it
endureth
forever
and
whoso
is
found
possessed
of
it
at
the
last
day
it
shall
be
well
with
him

wherefore
my
beloved
brethren
pray
unto
the
father
with
all
the
energy
of
heart
that
ye
may
be
filled
with
this
love
which
he
hath
bestowed
upon
all
who
are
true
followers
of
his
son
jesus
christ
that
ye
may
become
the
sons
of
god
that
when
he
shall
appear
we
shall
be
like
him
for
we
shall
see
him
as
he
is
that
we
may
have
this
hope
that
we
may
be
purified
even
as
he
is
pure
amen
moroni
chapter


an
epistle
of
my
father
mormon
written
to
me
moroni
and
it
was
written
unto
me
soon
after
my
calling
to
the
ministry
and
on
this
wise
did
he
write
unto
me
saying

my
beloved
son
moroni
i
rejoice
exceedingly
that
your
lord
jesus
christ
hath
been
mindful
of
you
and
hath
called
you
to
his
ministry
and
to
his
holy
work

i
am
mindful
of
you
always
in
my
prayers
continually
praying
unto
god
the
father
in
the
name
of
his
holy
child
jesus
that
he
through
his
infinite
goodness
and
grace
will
keep
you
through
the
endurance
of
faith
on
his
name
to
the
end

and
now
my
son
i
speak
unto
you
concerning
that
which
grieveth
me
exceedingly
for
it
grieveth
me
that
there
should
disputations
rise
among
you

for
if
i
have
learned
the
truth
there
have
been
disputations
among
you
concerning
the
baptism
of
your
little
children

and
now
my
son
i
desire
that
ye
should
labor
diligently
that
this
gross
error
should
be
removed
from
among
you
for
for
this
intent
i
have
written
this
epistle

for
immediately
after
i
had
learned
these
things
of
you
i
inquired
of
the
lord
concerning
the
matter
and
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
me
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
saying

listen
to
the
words
of
christ
your
redeemer
your
lord
and
your
god
behold
i
came
into
the
world
not
to
call
the
righteous
but
sinners
to
repentance
the
whole
need
no
physician
but
they
that
are
sick
wherefore
little
children
are
whole
for
they
are
not
capable
of
committing
sin
wherefore
the
curse
of
adam
is
taken
from
them
in
me
that
it
hath
no
power
over
them
and
the
law
of
circumcision
is
done
away
in
me

and
after
this
manner
did
the
holy
ghost
manifest
the
word
of
god
unto
me
wherefore
my
beloved
son
i
know
that
it
is
solemn
mockery
before
god
that
ye
should
baptize
little
children

behold
i
say
unto
you
that
this
thing
shall
ye
teachrepentance
and
baptism
unto
those
who
are
accountable
and
capable
of
committing
sin
yea
teach
parents
that
they
must
repent
and
be
baptized
and
humble
themselves
as
their
little
children
and
they
shall
all
be
saved
with
their
little
children

and
their
little
children
need
no
repentance
neither
baptism
behold
baptism
is
unto
repentance
to
the
fulfilling
the
commandments
unto
the
remission
of
sins

but
little
children
are
alive
in
christ
even
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
if
not
so
god
is
a
partial
god
and
also
a
changeable
god
and
a
respecter
to
persons
for
how
many
little
children
have
died
without
baptism

wherefore
if
little
children
could
not
be
saved
without
baptism
these
must
have
gone
to
an
endless
hell

behold
i
say
unto
you
that
he
that
supposeth
that
little
children
need
baptism
is
in
the
gall
of
bitterness
and
in
the
bonds
of
iniquity
for
he
hath
neither
faith
hope
nor
charity
wherefore
should
he
be
cut
off
while
in
the
thought
he
must
go
down
to
hell

for
awful
is
the
wickedness
to
suppose
that
god
saveth
one
child
because
of
baptism
and
the
other
must
perish
because
he
hath
no
baptism

wo
be
unto
them
that
shall
pervert
the
ways
of
the
lord
after
this
manner
for
they
shall
perish
except
they
repent
behold
i
speak
with
boldness
having
authority
from
god
and
i
fear
not
what
man
can
do
for
perfect
love
casteth
out
all
fear

and
i
am
filled
with
charity
which
is
everlasting
love
wherefore
all
children
are
alike
unto
me
wherefore
i
love
little
children
with
a
perfect
love
and
they
are
all
alike
and
partakers
of
salvation

for
i
know
that
god
is
not
a
partial
god
neither
a
changeable
being
but
he
is
unchangeable
from
all
eternity
to
all
eternity

little
children
cannot
repent
wherefore
it
is
awful
wickedness
to
deny
the
pure
mercies
of
god
unto
them
for
they
are
all
alive
in
him
because
of
his
mercy

and
he
that
saith
that
little
children
need
baptism
denieth
the
mercies
of
christ
and
setteth
at
naught
the
atonement
of
him
and
the
power
of
his
redemption

wo
unto
such
for
they
are
in
danger
of
death
hell
and
an
endless
torment
i
speak
it
boldly
god
hath
commanded
me
listen
unto
them
and
give
heed
or
they
stand
against
you
at
the
judgmentseat
of
christ

for
behold
that
all
little
children
are
alive
in
christ
and
also
all
they
that
are
without
the
law
for
the
power
of
redemption
cometh
on
all
them
that
have
no
law
wherefore
he
that
is
not
condemned
or
he
that
is
under
no
condemnation
cannot
repent
and
unto
such
baptism
availeth
nothing

but
it
is
mockery
before
god
denying
the
mercies
of
christ
and
the
power
of
his
holy
spirit
and
putting
trust
in
dead
works

behold
my
son
this
thing
ought
not
to
be
for
repentance
is
unto
them
that
are
under
condemnation
and
under
the
curse
of
a
broken
law

and
the
first
fruits
of
repentance
is
baptism
and
baptism
cometh
by
faith
unto
the
fulfilling
the
commandments
and
the
fulfilling
the
commandments
bringeth
remission
of
sins

and
the
remission
of
sins
bringeth
meekness
and
lowliness
of
heart
and
because
of
meekness
and
lowliness
of
heart
cometh
the
visitation
of
the
holy
ghost
which
comforter
filleth
with
hope
and
perfect
love
which
love
endureth
by
diligence
unto
prayer
until
the
end
shall
come
when
all
the
saints
shall
dwell
with
god

behold
my
son
i
will
write
unto
you
again
if
i
go
not
out
soon
against
the
lamanites
behold
the
pride
of
this
nation
or
the
people
of
the
nephites
hath
proven
their
destruction
except
they
should
repent

pray
for
them
my
son
that
repentance
may
come
unto
them
but
behold
i
fear
lest
the
spirit
hath
ceased
striving
with
them
and
in
this
part
of
the
land
they
are
also
seeking
to
put
down
all
power
and
authority
which
cometh
from
god
and
they
are
denying
the
holy
ghost

and
after
rejecting
so
great
a
knowledge
my
son
they
must
perish
soon
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
prophecies
which
were
spoken
by
the
prophets
as
well
as
the
words
of
our
savior
himself

farewell
my
son
until
i
shall
write
unto
you
or
shall
meet
you
again

chapter


my
beloved
son
i
write
unto
you
again
that
ye
may
know
that
i
am
yet
alive
but
i
write
somewhat
of
that
which
is
grievous

for
behold
i
have
had
a
sore
battle
with
the
lamanites
in
which
we
did
not
conquer
and
archeantus
has
fallen
by
the
sword
and
also
luram
and
emron
yea
and
we
have
lost
a
great
number
of
our
choice
men

and
now
behold
my
son
i
fear
lest
the
lamanites
shall
destroy
this
people
for
they
do
not
repent
and
satan
stirreth
them
up
continually
to
anger
one
with
another

behold
i
am
laboring
with
them
continually
and
when
i
speak
the
word
of
god
with
sharpness
they
tremble
and
anger
against
me
and
when
i
use
no
sharpness
they
harden
their
hearts
against
it
wherefore
i
fear
lest
the
spirit
of
the
lord
hath
ceased
striving
with
them

for
so
exceedingly
do
they
anger
that
it
seemeth
me
that
they
have
no
fear
of
death
and
they
have
lost
their
love
one
towards
another
and
they
thirst
after
blood
and
revenge
continually

and
now
my
beloved
son
notwithstanding
their
hardness
let
us
labor
diligently
for
if
we
should
cease
to
labor
we
should
be
brought
under
condemnation
for
we
have
a
labor
to
perform
whilst
in
this
tabernacle
of
clay
that
we
may
conquer
the
enemy
of
all
righteousness
and
rest
our
souls
in
the
kingdom
of
god

and
now
i
write
somewhat
concerning
the
sufferings
of
this
people
for
according
to
the
knowledge
which
i
have
received
from
amoron
behold
the
lamanites
have
many
prisoners
which
they
took
from
the
tower
of
sherrizah
and
there
were
men
women
and
children

and
the
husbands
and
fathers
of
those
women
and
children
they
have
slain
and
they
feed
the
women
upon
the
flesh
of
their
husbands
and
the
children
upon
the
flesh
of
their
fathers
and
no
water
save
a
little
do
they
give
unto
them

and
notwithstanding
this
great
abomination
of
the
lamanites
it
doth
not
exceed
that
of
our
people
in
moriantum
for
behold
many
of
the
daughters
of
the
lamanites
have
they
taken
prisoners
and
after
depriving
them
of
that
which
was
most
dear
and
precious
above
all
things
which
is
chastity
and
virtue

and
after
they
had
done
this
thing
they
did
murder
them
in
a
most
cruel
manner
torturing
their
bodies
even
unto
death
and
after
they
have
done
this
they
devour
their
flesh
like
unto
wild
beasts
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
they
do
it
for
a
token
of
bravery

o
my
beloved
son
how
can
a
people
like
this
that
are
without
civilization

and
only
a
few
years
have
passed
away
and
they
were
a
civil
and
a
delightsome
people

but
o
my
son
how
can
a
people
like
this
whose
delight
is
in
so
much
abomination

how
can
we
expect
that
god
will
stay
his
hand
in
judgment
against
us

behold
my
heart
cries
wo
unto
this
people
come
out
in
judgment
o
god
and
hide
their
sins
and
wickedness
and
abominations
from
before
thy
face

and
again
my
son
there
are
many
widows
and
their
daughters
who
remain
in
sherrizah
and
that
part
of
the
provisions
which
the
lamanites
did
not
carry
away
behold
the
army
of
zenephi
has
carried
away
and
left
them
to
wander
whithersoever
they
can
for
food
and
many
old
women
do
faint
by
the
way
and
die

and
the
army
which
is
with
me
is
weak
and
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
are
betwixt
sherrizah
and
me
and
as
many
as
have
fled
to
the
army
of
aaron
have
fallen
victims
to
their
awful
brutality

o
the
depravity
of
my
people
they
are
without
order
and
without
mercy
behold
i
am
but
a
man
and
i
have
but
the
strength
of
a
man
and
i
cannot
any
longer
enforce
my
commands

and
they
have
become
strong
in
their
perversion
and
they
are
alike
brutal
sparing
none
neither
old
nor
young
and
they
delight
in
everything
save
that
which
is
good
and
the
suffering
of
our
women
and
our
children
upon
all
the
face
of
this
land
doth
exceed
everything
yea
tongue
cannot
tell
neither
can
it
be
written

and
now
my
son
i
dwell
no
longer
upon
this
horrible
scene
behold
thou
knowest
the
wickedness
of
this
people
thou
knowest
that
they
are
without
principle
and
past
feeling
and
their
wickedness
doth
exceed
that
of
the
lamanites

behold
my
son
i
cannot
recommend
them
unto
god
lest
he
should
smite
me

but
behold
my
son
i
recommend
thee
unto
god
and
i
trust
in
christ
that
thou
wilt
be
saved
and
i
pray
unto
god
that
he
will
spare
thy
life
to
witness
the
return
of
his
people
unto
him
or
their
utter
destruction
for
i
know
that
they
must
perish
except
they
repent
and
return
unto
him

and
if
they
perish
it
will
be
like
unto
the
jaredites
because
of
the
wilfulness
of
their
hearts
seeking
for
blood
and
revenge

and
if
it
so
be
that
they
perish
we
know
that
many
of
our
brethren
have
deserted
over
unto
the
lamanites
and
many
more
will
also
desert
over
unto
them
wherefore
write
somewhat
a
few
things
if
thou
art
spared
and
i
shall
perish
and
not
see
thee
but
i
trust
that
i
may
see
thee
soon
for
i
have
sacred
records
that
i
would
deliver
up
unto
thee

my
son
be
faithful
in
christ
and
may
not
the
things
which
i
have
written
grieve
thee
to
weigh
thee
down
unto
death
but
may
christ
lift
thee
up
and
may
his
sufferings
and
death
and
the
showing
his
body
unto
our
fathers
and
his
mercy
and
longsuffering
and
the
hope
of
his
glory
and
of
eternal
life
rest
in
your
mind
forever

and
may
the
grace
of
god
the
father
whose
throne
is
high
in
the
heavens
and
our
lord
jesus
christ
who
sitteth
on
the
right
hand
of
his
power
until
all
things
shall
become
subject
unto
him
be
and
abide
with
you
forever
amen
moroni
chapter


now
i
moroni
write
somewhat
as
seemeth
me
good
and
i
write
unto
my
brethren
the
lamanites
and
i
would
that
they
should
know
that
more
than
four
hundred
and
twenty
years
have
passed
away
since
the
sign
was
given
of
the
coming
of
christ

and
i
seal
up
these
records
after
i
have
spoken
a
few
words
by
way
of
exhortation
unto
you

behold
i
would
exhort
you
that
when
ye
shall
read
these
things
if
it
be
wisdom
in
god
that
ye
should
read
them
that
ye
would
remember
how
merciful
the
lord
hath
been
unto
the
children
of
men
from
the
creation
of
adam
even
down
unto
the
time
that
ye
shall
receive
these
things
and
ponder
it
in
your
hearts

and
when
ye
shall
receive
these
things
i
would
exhort
you
that
ye
would
ask
god
the
eternal
father
in
the
name
of
christ
if
these
things
are
not
true
and
if
ye
shall
ask
with
a
sincere
heart
with
real
intent
having
faith
in
christ
he
will
manifest
the
truth
of
it
unto
you
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost

and
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
ye
may
know
the
truth
of
all
things

and
whatsoever
thing
is
good
is
just
and
true
wherefore
nothing
that
is
good
denieth
the
christ
but
acknowledgeth
that
he
is

and
ye
may
know
that
he
is
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
wherefore
i
would
exhort
you
that
ye
deny
not
the
power
of
god
for
he
worketh
by
power
according
to
the
faith
of
the
children
of
men
the
same
today
and
tomorrow
and
forever

and
again
i
exhort
you
my
brethren
that
ye
deny
not
the
gifts
of
god
for
they
are
many
and
they
come
from
the
same
god
and
there
are
different
ways
that
these
gifts
are
administered
but
it
is
the
same
god
who
worketh
all
in
all
and
they
are
given
by
the
manifestations
of
the
spirit
of
god
unto
men
to
profit
them

for
behold
to
one
is
given
by
the
spirit
of
god
that
he
may
teach
the
word
of
wisdom

and
to
another
that
he
may
teach
the
word
of
knowledge
by
the
same
spirit

and
to
another
exceedingly
great
faith
and
to
another
the
gifts
of
healing
by
the
same
spirit

and
again
to
another
that
he
may
work
mighty
miracles

and
again
to
another
that
he
may
prophesy
concerning
all
things

and
again
to
another
the
beholding
of
angels
and
ministering
spirits

and
again
to
another
all
kinds
of
tongues

and
again
to
another
the
interpretation
of
languages
and
of
divers
kinds
of
tongues

and
all
these
gifts
come
by
the
spirit
of
christ
and
they
come
unto
every
man
severally
according
as
he
will

and
i
would
exhort
you
my
beloved
brethren
that
ye
remember
that
every
good
gift
cometh
of
christ

and
i
would
exhort
you
my
beloved
brethren
that
ye
remember
that
he
is
the
same
yesterday
today
and
forever
and
that
all
these
gifts
of
which
i
have
spoken
which
are
spiritual
never
will
be
done
away
even
as
long
as
the
world
shall
stand
only
according
to
the
unbelief
of
the
children
of
men

wherefore
there
must
be
faith
and
if
there
must
be
faith
there
must
also
be
hope
and
if
there
must
be
hope
there
must
also
be
charity

and
except
ye
have
charity
ye
can
in
nowise
be
saved
in
the
kingdom
of
god
neither
can
ye
be
saved
in
the
kingdom
of
god
if
ye
have
not
faith
neither
can
ye
if
ye
have
no
hope

and
if
ye
have
no
hope
ye
must
needs
be
in
despair
and
despair
cometh
because
of
iniquity

and
christ
truly
said
unto
our
fathers
if
ye
have
faith
ye
can
do
all
things
which
are
expedient
unto
me

and
now
i
speak
unto
all
the
ends
of
the
earththat
if
the
day
cometh
that
the
power
and
gifts
of
god
shall
be
done
away
among
you
it
shall
be
because
of
unbelief

and
wo
be
unto
the
children
of
men
if
this
be
the
case
for
there
shall
be
none
that
doeth
good
among
you
no
not
one
for
if
there
be
one
among
you
that
doeth
good
he
shall
work
by
the
power
and
gifts
of
god

and
wo
unto
them
who
shall
do
these
things
away
and
die
for
they
die
in
their
sins
and
they
cannot
be
saved
in
the
kingdom
of
god
and
i
speak
it
according
to
the
words
of
christ
and
i
lie
not

and
i
exhort
you
to
remember
these
things
for
the
time
speedily
cometh
that
ye
shall
know
that
i
lie
not
for
ye
shall
see
me
at
the
bar
of
god
and
the
lord
god
will
say
unto
you
did
i
not
declare
my
words
unto
you
which
were
written
by
this
man
like
as
one
crying
from
the
dead
yea
even
as
one
speaking
out
of
the
dust

i
declare
these
things
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
prophecies
and
behold
they
shall
proceed
forth
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
everlasting
god
and
his
word
shall
hiss
forth
from
generation
to
generation

and
god
shall
show
unto
you
that
that
which
i
have
written
is
true

and
again
i
would
exhort
you
that
ye
would
come
unto
christ
and
lay
hold
upon
every
good
gift
and
touch
not
the
evil
gift
nor
the
unclean
thing

and
awake
and
arise
from
the
dust
o
jerusalem
yea
and
put
on
thy
beautiful
garments
o
daughter
of
zion
and
strengthen
thy
stakes
and
enlarge
thy
borders
forever
that
thou
mayest
no
more
be
confounded
that
the
covenants
of
the
eternal
father
which
he
hath
made
unto
thee
o
house
of
israel
may
be
fulfilled

yea
come
unto
christ
and
be
perfected
in
him
and
deny
yourselves
of
all
ungodliness
and
if
ye
shall
deny
yourselves
of
all
ungodliness
and
love
god
with
all
your
might
mind
and
strength
then
is
his
grace
sufficient
for
you
that
by
his
grace
ye
may
be
perfect
in
christ
and
if
by
the
grace
of
god
ye
are
perfect
in
christ
ye
can
in
nowise
deny
the
power
of
god

and
again
if
ye
by
the
grace
of
god
are
perfect
in
christ
and
deny
not
his
power
then
are
ye
sanctified
in
christ
by
the
grace
of
god
through
the
shedding
of
the
blood
of
christ
which
is
in
the
covenant
of
the
father
unto
the
remission
of
your
sins
that
ye
become
holy
without
spot

and
now
i
bid
unto
all
farewell
i
soon
go
to
rest
in
the
paradise
of
god
until
my
spirit
and
body
shall
again
reunite
and
i
am
brought
forth
triumphant
through
the
air
to
meet
you
before
the
pleasing
bar
of
the
great
jehovah
the
eternal
judge
of
both
quick
and
dead
amen
